| Leviticus 1:1 | “And He called to Moses” | Sanhedrin 101a:4 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> among those who have no share in the World-to-Come is <b>one who whispers</b> invocations <b>over a wound. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> that is the case only <b>where he spits into</b> the wound while he whispers, <b>as one does not mention the name of Heaven over spittle,</b> and doing so is an act of contempt for God. <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav says: Even</b> the verse: “When <b>a leprous mark</b> is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest” (Leviticus 13:9), in which there is no mention of the name of God, may not be whispered as an invocation. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Even</b> a verse that is unrelated to the specific illness in question, for example: <b>“And He called to Moses”</b> (Leviticus 1:1), may not be whispered as an invocation. |
| Leviticus 1:1 | spoke | Yoma 4b:11 | The verse says: <b>“And He called unto Moses, and</b> the Lord <b>spoke</b> unto him from within the Tent of Meeting, saying” (Leviticus 1:1). <b>Why</b> does the verse mention <b>calling before speaking,</b> and God did not speak to him at the outset? <b>The Torah is teaching etiquette: A person</b> should <b>not say anything to another unless he calls him</b> first. This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: A person should not say anything to another unless he calls him</b> first. With regard to the term concluding the verse: <b>“Saying,” Rabbi Musya, grandson of Rabbi Masya, said in the name of Rabbi Musya the Great: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who tells another</b> some <b>matter, that</b> it is incumbent upon the latter <b>not</b> to <b>say it</b> to others <b>until</b> the former explicitly <b>says to him: Go and tell others? As it is stated: “And the Lord spoke to him from</b> within <b>the Tent of Meeting, saying [<i>lemor</i>].”</b> <i>Lemor</i> is a contraction of <i>lo emor</i>, meaning: Do not say. One must be given permission before transmitting information. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | raises an objection | Bava Kamma40b:16 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the verse: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The phrase <b>“from the cattle”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality and</b> an animal that <b>was the object of bestiality</b> from eligibility to be brought as an offering. The phrase <b>“from the herd”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that had been <b>worshipped</b> as a god. <b>“From the flock”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that had been <b>set aside</b> for idol worship. The additional conjunction “or,” in the phrase <b>“or from the flock”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>gores</b> a person, killing him. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | as the Sages taught | Bekhorot 41a:15 | They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), each mention of the word “from” is interpreted as a term of exclusion. The expression <b>“from the cattle”</b> serves <b>to exclude an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality.</b> The expression <b>“from the herd”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>worshipped</b> as a deity, and <b>“from the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>set aside</b> for idol worship. Finally, the word “or” in the expression <b>“or from the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>gored</b> and killed a person. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | “Speak to the children of [ benei ] Israel” | Chagigah 16b:15 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Speak to the children of [<i>benei</i>] Israel”</b> (Leviticus 1:2). The word <i>benei</i> literally means: Sons of. And it states nearby: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand on the head of the burnt-offering” (Leviticus 1:4), from which we learn that <b>the sons of Israel place</b> their hands, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place</b> them. <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yishmael say: It is optional for the daughters of Israel to place</b> their hands. They may place their hands if they so choose, although they are not obligated to do so. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | with regard to accepting an offering from them, as it is taught | Chullin 13b:6 | <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> It is stated <b>with regard to accepting an offering from them, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When any person of you shall bring an offering” (Leviticus 1:2): The verse states: <b>“Of you,” and not:</b> Of <b>all of you, to exclude the</b> Jewish <b>transgressor</b> who regularly violates a prohibition. Furthermore, God states: <b>“Of you,”</b> to mean that <b>among you,</b> the Jews, <b>I distinguished</b> between a transgressor and other Jews, <b>but not among the nations.</b> One accepts an offering from all gentiles, even a heretic. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | raises an objection | Chullin 5a:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Anan from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When any man of you brings an offering unto the Lord, from the animal” (Leviticus 1:2). The <i>tanna</i> infers: <b>“Of you,”</b> indicating: <b>But not all of you.</b> This serves <b>to exclude the transgressor,</b> from whom an offering is not accepted. The <i>tanna</i> continues: The term <b>“of you”</b> is also interpreted to mean that <b>I distinguished among you and not among the nations.</b> Therefore, a gentile may bring an offering even if he is an idol worshipper. The expression <b>“from the animal”</b> serves <b>to include people who are similar to an animal</b> in that they do not recognize God. <b>From here,</b> the Sages <b>stated: One accepts offerings from Jewish transgressors so that they will consequently repent, except for the transgressor, one who pours wine as a libation</b> to idolatry, <b>and one who desecrates Shabbat in public [<i>befarhesya</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 1:2 | As it was taught | Eruvin 69b:5 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When any man of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, of the herd, or of the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The <i>baraita</i> expounds: <b>“Of you,”</b> i.e., some of you, but <b>not all of you</b> may bring an offering – <b>to the exclusion of an apostate. “Of you”</b> additionally serves to emphasize that <b>among you,</b> the children of Israel, <b>I distinguish</b> between those who observe the Torah and are fit to bring an offering, and those who are not fit, <b>but not among the nations,</b> i.e., in regard to the other nations, even those who do not fulfill the precepts binding upon them may offer their sacrifices. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | brings | Menachot 104b:7 | § The mishna stated that <b>two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a tenth of an ephah together. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when an individual <b>brings</b> a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), in the singular, that is not a proof, as with regard to <b>a burnt offering as well, it is written</b> in the singular: “When any man of you <b>brings</b> an offering” (Leviticus 1:2). Nevertheless, two people may bring a burnt offering together, as stated in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | The Sages taught | Menachot 5b:7 | § The Gemara discusses the prohibition against sacrificing an item that is prohibited to the Jewish people. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from a passage in the Torah that discusses burnt offerings: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited for sacrifice upon the altar (see <i>Temura</i> 28a). <b>When it states later,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), this is difficult, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, as it was already written earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being brought as an offering. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | “A person, when he sacrifices from you an offering to the Lord, of the animals: Of the herd and of the flock, | Menachot 90b:13 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This</b> verse <b>is unnecessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “A sacrifice,” and a bird</b> offering <b>is not</b> referred to as <b>a sacrifice. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock”? Since it is stated</b> with regard to a burnt offering: <b>“A person, when he sacrifices from you an offering to the Lord, of the animals: Of the herd and of the flock,</b> you shall sacrifice your offering” (Leviticus 1:2), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who</b> takes a vow by <b>saying: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering,</b> without specifying which type of animal he will bring, that he must <b>bring</b> animals <b>of</b> both of <b>these two</b> types, i.e., from the herd and the flock. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock,”</b> separating the two types with the word “or,” thereby indicating that if <b>he wanted</b> to bring <b>one</b> of them, he may <b>bring</b> just one, and if he <b>wanted</b> to bring <b>two,</b> he may <b>bring</b> two. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | a gentile | Menachot 93a:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains why certain types of people do not place hands on an offering: <b>Granted, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> do not place their hands on the offering, <b>as they are not mentally competent.</b> The exclusion of <b>a gentile</b> is also understandable, as the verses concerning placing hands are introduced with: “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them” (Leviticus 1:2), which indicates that <b>the children of Israel place hands</b> upon their offerings, <b>but gentiles do not place</b> their <b>hands</b> upon their offerings. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a blind person, what is the reason</b> that he does <b>not</b> place his hands on his offering? |
| Leviticus 1:2 | verse, | Nazir 35a:8 | <b>Rav Yehuda of Diskarta said to Rava: And let</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>derive</b> the method of a detail, a generalization, and a detail <b>from this</b> earlier <b>verse,</b> which appears in the same chapter: “From animals, from the herd or from the flock, you shall bring your offering” (Leviticus 1:2), in the following manner: <b>“From”</b> is <b>a detail</b> that excludes an undomesticated animal; <b>“animals”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> which includes undomesticated animals (see Deuteronomy, chapter 14); and when it states: <b>“Herd,” and: “Flock,”</b> the Torah <b>has detailed again.</b> This is <b>a detail, and a generalization, and a detail,</b> and therefore <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail,</b> i.e., domesticated animals. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | The verse states: “An offering to the Lord” | Nedarim 10b:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a person should not say: To the Lord a burnt-offering,</b> or: <b>To the Lord a meal-offering,</b> or: <b>To the Lord a thanks-offering,</b> or: <b>To the Lord a peace-offering,</b> but should mention the offering first and then state that it is for the Lord? <b>The verse states: “An offering to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:2). The reason for this is that if one first says: To the Lord, perhaps he will change his mind and not complete the sentence in order to avoid consecrating the offering, and he will have uttered the name of God in vain. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | derived from elsewhere, | Niddah 41a:8 | The Gemara explains: Now <b>are these</b> disqualifications <b>derived from here,</b> from the verse adduced by the <i>baraita</i>? No, they are <b>derived from elsewhere,</b> as taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The expression <b>“from the cattle”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> from eligibility as an offering <b>an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality.</b> The expression <b>“from the herd”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that was worshipped</b> as a deity. <b>“From the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>set aside</b> for idol worship. The word “or” in the expression <b>“or from the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that gored</b> a person, killing him. In all these cases the animal cannot be consecrated at all, and therefore it is not necessary for the Torah to teach that they must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | The Merciful One says: “When a person sacrifices from yours | Sukkah 30a:2 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, before</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, the robber may not sacrifice the animal because the animal does not belong to him. <b>The Merciful One says: “When a person sacrifices from yours</b> an offering” (Leviticus 1:2). The term “from yours” indicates that the animal must belong to the one sacrificing it, <b>and this</b> stolen animal <b>is not his. However, after</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>didn’t</b> the robber <b>acquire</b> the animal <b>with</b> the <b>despair?</b> Once the owner despairs, the animal belongs to the robber, despite the fact that he incurs a debt that he must repay the owner. Since the animal is legally his, why is it prohibited for the robber to sacrifice it as an offering? <b>Rather, is it not because</b> the offering <b>is a mitzva that comes by means of a transgression?</b> Since the animal came into his possession by means of a transgression, it is unfit for use in fulfilling a mitzva. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | as the Sages taught | Temurah 28a:14 | § The mishna’s list of disqualified animals includes <b>an animal that copulated with a person, and an animal that was the object of bestiality.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> these animals <b>are prohibited</b> as offerings <b>to the Most High?</b> The Gemara answers that this is <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The limitation indicated by the phrase <b>“from the cattle”</b> serves <b>to exclude an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality</b> from eligibility as an offering. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | “from the flock” | Temurah 28b:11 | § The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that the phrase <b>“from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:2) serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>set aside</b> for idol worship, while the conjunction “or” at the beginning of the phrase <b>“or from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:2) serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that gored</b> and killed a person. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If</b> it <b>is stated</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person</b> is disqualified as a sacrifice, <b>why is it stated</b> that an animal that <b>gored</b> is disqualified? <b>And if it is stated</b> that an animal that <b>gored</b> is disqualified, <b>why is it stated</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person</b> is disqualified? How do the transgressions differ? |
| Leviticus 1:2 | “From the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” | Temurah 28b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who says that the disqualifications of an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality, the set-aside, and the worshipped animal, are derived from the case of blemished animals, <b>what</b> does he <b>derive from</b> the verse: <b>“From the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:2), which is the source of these disqualifications according to the earlier <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers that he <b>requires</b> these three terms to <b>exclude sick, old, and filthy</b> animals, which may not be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | As it is taught | Temurah 29a:11 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It was previously derived from the verse: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited to be sacrificed on the altar (see 28a). <b>When it says below,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd,” there is</b> apparently <b>no need for the verse to state</b> this, as it was already stated earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude a <i>tereifa</i></b> from being brought as an offering. |
| Leviticus 1:2 | Had | Zevachim 34a:15 | <b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Had</b> the verse (Leviticus 1:2) <b>stated</b> only: When any man of you brings <b>an offering to the Lord, animals [<i>behema</i>]</b>, <b>I would say</b> that even <b>an undomesticated animal</b> is included <b>in the category of an animal [<i>behema</i>], like that</b> which <b>is stated: “These are the animals [<i>behema</i>] that you may eat: The ox, the sheep, and the goat, the deer, and the gazelle,</b> and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the oryx, and the aurochs, and the mountain sheep” (Deuteronomy 14:4–5), and, for example, the deer and gazelle are undomesticated animals. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “From animals, from the <b>cattle and</b> from the <b>flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:2), which indicates that God says: <b>I have told you</b> to bring offerings from the <b>cattle and</b> the <b>flock, but not an undomesticated animal.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:2 | of the animals” | Zevachim 85b:7 | The Gemara presents a discussion in which the opinion of Rabbi Akiva is cited: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises the dilemma: Is</b> the disqualification of <b>an animal that was the object of bestiality</b> applicable <b>with regard to birds, or is</b> there <b>no</b> disqualification of <b>an animal that was the object of bestiality with regard to birds? Did</b> the verse <b>say:</b> “When any man of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering <b>of the animals”</b> (Leviticus 1:2), where the term “of” serves <b>to exclude</b> from being brought as offerings both <b>an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality,</b> in order to equate the two? |
| Leviticus 1:3 | of his own volition, | Arakhin 21a:12 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Although</b> one obligated to bring burnt offerings and peace offerings <b>does not achieve atonement until he</b> brings the offering <b>of his own volition,</b> as it is stated: “He shall bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting of his volition” (Leviticus 1:3), nevertheless, one coerces him until he says: I want to do so. Similarly, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to a burnt offering: <b>“He shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), which <b>teaches that one coerces him</b> to bring his burnt offering. One <b>might</b> have thought he brings the offering <b>against his will;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of his volition”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The court <b>coerces him until he says: I want to</b> do so. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | of his volition” | Arakhin 21a:6 | <b>Although</b> one obligated to bring burnt offerings and peace offerings <b>does not achieve atonement until he</b> brings the offering <b>of his own volition, as it is stated:</b> “He shall bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting <b>of his volition”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), nevertheless the court <b>coerces him until he says: I want</b> to do so. <b>And likewise, you say</b> the same <b>with regard to women’s bills of divorce.</b> Although one divorces his wife only of his own volition, in any case where the Sages obligated a husband to divorce his wife the court <b>coerces him until he says: I want</b> to do so. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | he shall offer it | Bava Batra48a:1 | With regard to one who pledges to bring a burnt-offering, the verse states: “If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, <b>he shall offer it</b> a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, according to his will, before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:3). The seemingly superfluous phrase “he shall offer it” <b>teaches that they</b> can <b>coerce him</b> to bring the offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that it can be offered entirely <b>against his will,</b> by taking it from his possession and sacrificing it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>They coerce him</b> with various punishments <b>until he says: I want</b> to bring the offering. This seems to prove that consent resulting from coercion is considered to be valid consent. Perhaps this principle can apply to acquisition, as a source for Rav Huna’s ruling. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | Abaye raised an objection to Rabba | Bava Kamma66b:3 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to Rabba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse: “If his offering is a burnt-offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), indicates that one’s offering must be <b>“his offering,” but not</b> an animal <b>stolen</b> from another. <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case referred to by the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is dealing with a stolen animal that the robber consecrates and sacrificed <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovery, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? It <b>is obvious</b> that this is disqualified, as one cannot even consecrate an animal that does not belong to him. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | from here, | Bava Kamma67b:2 | <b>Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> may be derived <b>from here,</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “If his offering is a burnt-offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), indicates that one’s offering must be <b>“his offering,” but not</b> an animal <b>stolen</b> from another. <b>When,</b> i.e., in which circumstances, is it necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is dealing with a stolen animal that the robber consecrated and sacrificed <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovery, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? It <b>is obvious</b> that it is disqualified, as one cannot even consecrate an animal that does not belong to him. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | “A male” | Bekhorot 41b:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>. It states with regard to a burnt offering from cattle: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), from which it can be inferred: <b>But not a female. When it says below,</b> with regard to a burnt offering from sheep: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:10), a second time, it is difficult to understand, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> “a male” again? This serves <b>to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> which are disqualified from being sacrificed as burnt offerings. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | “A male” | Bekhorot 42a:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to a burnt offering from cattle: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), from which it can be inferred: <b>But not a female. When it says below,</b> with regard to a burnt offering from sheep: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:10), a second time, it is difficult to understand, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> “a male” again? This serves <b>to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> which are disqualified as burnt offerings. The Gemara answers: <b>Omit from</b> this <i>baraita</i> the mention of <b>a <i>tumtum</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:3 | as it is written: “He shall bring it in accordance with his will” | Keritot 7a:11 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> their dispute is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between later <i>amora’im</i>: Concerning <b>one who says: My sin offering,</b> which is sacrificed for me, <b>should not atone for me, Abaye said:</b> This sin offering <b>does not atone</b> for him. <b>Rava said: It atones</b> for him. The Gemara explains: In a case <b>where he said:</b> I do <b>not</b> want it <b>to be sacrificed, everyone agrees that it does not atone</b> for him, <b>as it is written: “He shall bring it in accordance with his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), which indicates that if the offering is brought against his will it is not effective. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>when he says:</b> The sin offering <b>should be sacrificed but it should not atone</b> for me. <b>Abaye said:</b> It <b>does not atone</b> for him, <b>as he said</b> that <b>it should not atone</b> for him. <b>Rava said: It does atone</b> for him, as <b>once he says</b> it <b>should be sacrificed,</b> the <b>atonement comes by itself.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:3 | states later: “Of the herd” | Menachot 5b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes with a statement that will soon be explained: <b>And if you have responded,</b> i.e., if you succeeded in rejecting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, then <b>when</b> the verse <b>states later: “Of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this phrase, it serves <b>to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:3 | of the herd” | Menachot 5b:7 | § The Gemara discusses the prohibition against sacrificing an item that is prohibited to the Jewish people. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from a passage in the Torah that discusses burnt offerings: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited for sacrifice upon the altar (see <i>Temura</i> 28a). <b>When it states later,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), this is difficult, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, as it was already written earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being brought as an offering. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | the verse: | Menachot 6a:14 | <b>Rather, refute</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>like this: What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> with regard to both a blemished animal and one born by caesarean section <b>their blemish is noticeable,</b> as a blemished animal is visibly blemished and it is well known when an animal is born by caesarean section. <b>Will you say</b> that they can serve as the source of the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a <i>tereifa</i>, whose blemish is not</b> necessarily <b>noticeable? Due to that</b> reason, <b>the verse:</b> “Of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), <b>was necessary,</b> to teach that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | Isn’t it written: “If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd” | Menachot 91a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>Isn’t it written: “If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), and then in a separate verse it states: <b>“And if his offering is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:9)? The fact that these possibilities are presented in two disjointed verses is an explicit indication that the burnt offering can be brought from even just one of these animals. Therefore, even Rabbi Yoshiya concedes that there is no reason to presume a burnt offering must be brought from both types there. |
| Leviticus 1:3 | “He shall offer it” | Rosh Hashanah6a:7 | <b>“And do”;</b> this is <b>a warning to the court to make you</b> fulfill your vow. <b>Why do I</b> need this derivation? This rule <b>is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“He shall offer it”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He shall offer it,”</b> which <b>teaches that he must be forced</b> to bring his offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that he may be forced to bring his offering even <b>against his will.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In accordance with his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How so? The</b> court <b>coerces him until he says: I want to</b> bring the offering. Now, since all of these <i>halakhot</i> are already known from other sources, what is the point of this repetition? |
| Leviticus 1:3 | “He shall offer it” | Yevamot 106a:14 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is said with regard to some offerings: <b>“He shall offer it”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). This <b>teaches that they may coerce him</b> to bring the offering he owes. <b>I might have thought this means</b> that he brings the offering totally <b>against his will. Therefore, the</b> continuation of that <b>verse states: “In accordance with his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> two contradictory expositions <b>be</b> reconciled? <b>They coerce him</b> by imposing fines or penalties <b>until he says: I want to. And similarly, you find the same</b> principle <b>with respect to bills of divorce for women,</b> as it is prohibited for anyone other than the husband to write the bill of divorce, but <b>they coerce him until he says: I want to</b> divorce her, and then write the bill of divorce on his behalf. |

Consequently, one who sacrifices an undomesticated animal does not merely add to a mitzva of the Torah, but also violates a prohibition, |
| Leviticus 1:4 | “And he shall place | Chagigah 16b:15 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Speak to the children of [<i>benei</i>] Israel”</b> (Leviticus 1:2). The word <i>benei</i> literally means: Sons of. And it states nearby: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand on the head of the burnt-offering” (Leviticus 1:4), from which we learn that <b>the sons of Israel place</b> their hands, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place</b> them. <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yishmael say: It is optional for the daughters of Israel to place</b> their hands. They may place their hands if they so choose, although they are not obligated to do so. |
| Leviticus 1:4 | and it shall be accepted | Chullin 2b:3 | Rav Aḥa answered: <b>I am not speaking</b> about cases where it is stated: Everyone is <b>obligated,</b> as it goes without saying that fulfilling any obligation is permitted <i>ab initio</i>. Rav Ashi asked: <b>If that is so,</b> that which was stated: <b>Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>places hands</b> on the animal, <b>both men and women</b> (see <i>Menaḥot</i> 93a), is that <b>also</b> an expression indicating <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? But isn’t it written: “And he shall place his hand</b> upon the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted</b> for him to effect atonement for him” (Leviticus 1:4)? |
| Leviticus 1:4 | “And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement upon him” | Megillah 8a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a burnt-offering, that the verse states: <b>“And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement upon him”</b> (Leviticus 1:4). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: That which is</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> i.e., which he accepted as a personal obligation, <b>he bears responsibility</b> to replace <b>it</b> if it died or was stolen; <b>however, that which is not</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> i.e., that which he did not accept as a personal obligation but which he designated as an offering, he <b>does not bear responsibility</b> to replace <b>it.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:4 | his hand upon the head of | Menachot 93b:12 | <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one placed <b>his hand on the sides</b> of the animal’s head, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; does one fulfill the requirement of placing hands by doing so? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Bira’a, son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, says</b> that the verse: “And he shall place <b>his hand upon the head of</b> the burnt offering” (Leviticus 1:4), indicates that it must be done with his hand <b>on</b> the top of <b>its head and not</b> with <b>his hand on the sides</b> of its head. |
| Leviticus 1:4 | and it shall be accepted for him | Menachot 93b:7 | § The mishna states: The requirement of <b>placing hands is a non-essential mitzva. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall place his hand</b> upon the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted for him</b> to effect atonement for him” (Leviticus 1:4). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But does</b> the rite of <b>placing hands effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of the <b>blood? As it is stated</b> with regard to blood: “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to effect atonement for your souls, <b>for it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated placing hands</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>atones</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering. |
| Leviticus 1:4 | “And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him” | Pesachim 62a:1 | <b>disagree with regard to this verse,</b> which is stated with regard to a different offering: <b>“And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him”</b> (Leviticus 1:4). It is inferred: <b>For him and not for his fellow.</b> One cannot achieve atonement through an offering that has been designated for someone else. Rabba and Rav Ḥisda disagree with regard to the halakhic conclusions that should be drawn from this law. <b>Rabba holds</b> that the law applies to <b>another</b> who is <b>similar to him: Just as he is eligible for atonement</b> through the sprinkling of the blood of this offering, <b>so</b> the law applies to <b>another who is eligible for atonement.</b> This comes <b>to exclude this uncircumcised person, who is not eligible for atonement.</b> Since an uncircumcised person is not fit for the Paschal lamb, slaughtering it for him does not disqualify the offering. |
| Leviticus 1:4 | and it shall be accepted | Yoma 5a:2 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings that apply <b>throughout the generations</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we derive</b> that failure to place hands on the head of the animal <b>does not invalidate</b> the offering? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, <b>and it shall be accepted</b> for him to atone on his behalf” (Leviticus 1:4). <b>Does</b> the <b>placing</b> of <b>hands atone</b> for one’s sins? <b>Isn’t atonement</b> accomplished <b>only by</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11)? |
| Leviticus 1:4 | The verse states: “And it shall be accepted for him to atone for him” | Zevachim 4b:4 | <b>Rather, Rav Ashi says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to sprinkle the blood for the sake of one other than the owner is derived from a verse. <b>The verse states: “And it shall be accepted for him to atone for him”</b> (Leviticus 1:4), teaching that the sacrificial rite that atones for the owner, namely, the sprinkling of the blood, must be performed specifically for him, <b>and not for another.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:4 | and it shall be accepted | Zevachim 6a:15 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand on the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted</b> for him to atone for him” (Leviticus 1:4). <b>And does placing hands atone</b> for one’s sins? <b>But isn’t atonement</b> achieved <b>only by</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11)? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And he shall place…and it shall be accepted</b> for him <b>to atone”?</b> This teaches <b>that if one deemed</b> the ritual of <b>placing hands</b> to be <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and consequently failed to perform it, <b>the verse ascribes to him</b> blame <b>as though</b> the offering <b>did not atone</b> for his sins; <b>and</b> nevertheless, the offering <b>atoned</b> for his sins. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | shall offer | Chagigah 11a:9 | § The mishna stated that the <i>halakhot</i> of sacrificial <b>rites</b> have something to support them. The Gemara asks: Sacrificial rites <b>are written</b> explicitly in the Torah. The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary</b> to state that sacrificial rites have merely something to support them <b>only with regard to</b> the rite of <b>carrying the blood</b> to the altar. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall offer</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5); <b>this is</b> referring to <b>collecting the blood,</b> which is the stage before carrying the blood to the altar. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull” | Chullin 13a:11 | § <b>Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares in</b> the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., he slaughtered without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to him that it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), indicating <b>that the slaughter must be for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., knowing that he is performing an act of slaughter. Shmuel <b>said to</b> him: <b>we</b> received <b>this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already <b>that</b> one must have intent to slaughter the animal <i>ab initio</i>. But <b>from where</b> is it derived that intent to slaughter is <b>indispensable</b> even after the fact? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “You shall slaughter it to your will”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), indicating: <b>Slaughter</b> the animal <b>with your intent,</b> i.e., in the form of a purposeful action. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And he shall slaughter the young bull” | Chullin 17a:5 | The Gemara asks a series of questions: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that the meat of stabbing was forbidden in the wilderness, <b>that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the burnt offerings sacrificed in the Tabernacle: <b>“And he shall slaughter the young bull”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). <b>But according to Rabbi Akiva, what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“And he shall slaughter”?</b> Why would he slaughter it if stabbing is permitted? The Gemara answers: <b>Sacrificial</b> animals <b>are different,</b> as slaughter is required in that case. By contrast, there was no obligation to slaughter non-sacrificial animals to eat their meat. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And he shall slaughter [ veshaḥat ]” | Chullin 27a:11 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> From where is it derived that slaughter is performed from the neck? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: <b>“And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b><i>Veshaḥat</i>; rather,</b> read it as: <b><i>Vesaḥat</i>,</b> which literally means: And he shall squeeze, which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>speaks [<i>saḥ</i>], purify it [<i>ḥattehu</i>].</b> The animal’s voice emanates from its throat; therefore, it is slaughtered from the neck. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter [ veshaḥat ] the young bull | Chullin 27a:4 | <b>Rav Kahana says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to slaughter that it is</b> performed <b>from the neck?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>] the young bull</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>bends [<i>shaḥ</i>], purify it [<i>ḥattehu</i>]</b> through slaughter. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does one ascertain <b>that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of purification?</b> The Gemara answers: It is ascertained from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And he shall purify [<i>veḥitte</i>] the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is ascertained <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop and I will be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9). |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And he shall slaughter [ veshaḥat ] | Chullin 30b:14 | Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>]</b> the young bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5). The term <b>“<i>veshaḥat</i>”</b> means <b>nothing other than: And he shall draw</b> the knife across the neck of the animal. <b>And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And King Solomon made two hundred targets <b>of drawn [<i>shaḥut</i>] gold”</b> (I Kings 10:16), meaning gold that is smoothed in the manner of goldsmiths. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). |
| Leviticus 1:5 | burnt-offering, as it is written: “And they shall sprinkle the blood around upon the altar” | Eruvin 57a:6 | Rav Ashi responded: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>around? Around at the corners,</b> i.e., an open space of this size is provided at each corner. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that the area of the corners is also called around, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>burnt-offering, as it is written: “And they shall sprinkle the blood around upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), <b>here, too,</b> will you say that the blood must be sprinkled <b>literally “around”</b> the altar on all sides? The blood is sprinkled only upon the corners of the altar. <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of <b>around? Around the corners,</b> i.e., the mitzva is to sprinkle the blood at the corners, and this is considered sprinkling blood “around upon the altar.” <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the open space of the cities of the Levites, <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>around? Around the corners.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall present | Kiddushin 36a:22 | With regard to <b>receiving,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall present</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5). <b>And the Master said</b> in explanation of this verse: |
| Leviticus 1:5 | which is a matter indispensable to atonement, and about which priesthood is written? As it is written: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood” | Menachot 10a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there the <b>collection</b> of the blood in a service vessel, <b>which is a matter indispensable to atonement, and about which priesthood is written? As it is written: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), and <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the collection of the blood. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 15b): If <b>one collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the blood is <b>disqualified</b> for offering, <b>and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit,</b> despite the fact that priesthood is mentioned in the verse. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull | Menachot 110a:22 | This is <b>as Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares</b> in the case <b>of consecrated</b> items, i.e., if one slaughtered an offering without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, but rather appeared like one occupied with other matters, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to Shmuel: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), teaching that the mitzva is not performed properly <b>unless the slaughter is for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., with the knowledge that he is performing an act of slaughter. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sacrifice the blood and sprinkle the blood” | Menachot 19a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter? If that is so,</b> then this would pose a problem with regard to that <b>which is written: “And he shall slaughter the bull</b> before the Lord, <b>and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sacrifice the blood and sprinkle the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). The Sages infer from here that <b>from</b> the stage of the sacrificing of the blood, which begins with the <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>and onward, it is the mitzva</b> exclusively of members <b>of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> By inference, this <b>teaches that</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering, which is performed earlier, is <b>valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest. If according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter,</b> if the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering is performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> it <b>should also be unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And he shall slaughter | Yoma 27a:1 | The Gemara asks: But <b>that</b> verse about putting fire on the altar <b>is needed for its own sake,</b> to teach that the wood must be brought by a priest; it should not be interpreted as an inference that other services, such as flaying and cutting, may be performed by non-priests. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: I found Abaye explaining</b> Hizkiya’s derivation <b>to his son</b> based on the following <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), with no mention of a priest, which teaches that <b>slaughter by a non-priest is acceptable.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Now, from where would you come</b> to think otherwise? Why would one even suspect that a priest should be required to slaughter the offering, so that a specific verse is required to tell us otherwise? <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood”</b> (Numbers 18:7), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that no part of the sacrificial service may be performed by a non-priest, not <b>even slaughtering.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | the verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and the sons of Aaron…shall sacrifice the blood” | Yoma 27a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and the sons of Aaron…shall sacrifice the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), from which it is inferred that <b>from the</b> sacrificing of blood, which begins with the <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood.</b> Just prior to this the Torah states: <b>“And he shall place his hands</b> upon the head of the burnt-offering…<b>and he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:4–5). In this verse the Torah is referring to the donor of the offering when it says: He shall place his hands, and therefore when it continues: And he shall slaughter, it is also referring to the donor. The Torah thereby <b>taught</b> that <b>the slaughter</b> of the offering <b>is acceptable</b> if performed <b>by a non-priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | roundabout against the altar | Zevachim 119b:14 | The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>slaughtering</b> offerings of the most sacred order in the <b>north</b> is <b>as it is written:</b> “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar <b>northward before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:11). The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>placement</b> of the blood of a burnt offering <b>around,</b> i.e., on all four sides of, the altar, is <b>as it is written: “And</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall…sprinkle</b> the blood <b>roundabout against the altar</b> that is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:5). |
| Leviticus 1:5 | shall present | Zevachim 13a:11 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And</b> the sons of Aaron, the priests, <b>shall present</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>collection of the blood. Do you say</b> it is referring to <b>collection of the blood, or is it</b> referring to <b>only sprinkling</b> the blood? <b>When it states</b> immediately afterward: <b>“And sprinkle</b> the blood roundabout against the altar,” <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is thereby stated.</b> If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“And</b> the sons of Aaron, the priests, <b>shall present”? This</b> is referring to <b>collection of the blood.</b> And the phrase <b>“the sons of Aaron, the priests”</b> teaches <b>that</b> collection of the blood <b>must be</b> performed <b>by a fit priest,</b> i.e., one who has no blemish and who was not disqualified due to flawed lineage, <b>and</b> that he must do so while he is wearing priestly <b>service vestments.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | slaughter as well, isn’t it written: “Before the Lord” | Zevachim 32a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>placing hands</b> that it can be performed only by those who are ritually pure even by Torah law? It is <b>that it is written: “Before the Lord,”</b> which is referring to the Temple courtyard, and an impure person may not enter the Temple courtyard. With regard to <b>slaughter as well, isn’t it written: “Before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:5)? How can a ritually impure person enter the Temple courtyard to slaughter an offering? The Gemara answers: It is <b>possible,</b> in a case <b>where he fashions a long knife,</b> stands outside the Temple courtyard, <b>and slaughters</b> the offering that is inside the courtyard. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And he shall slaughter | Zevachim 32a:5 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from what was taught in the halakhic midrash <i>Torat Kohanim</i>: The verse states with regard to a burnt offering: <b>“And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5). The fact that the verse does not stipulate that a priest must slaughter the offering teaches that <b>slaughter is valid</b> if performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> as stated in the mishna: <b>As the</b> sacrificial rite of <b>slaughter is valid</b> when performed <b>by non-priests, by women, by</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, and by ritually impure</b> individuals, <b>and even with</b> regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order. Or</b> perhaps the term “and he shall slaughter” in the verse is referring <b>only</b> to slaughter <b>by priests?</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | shall present [ vehikrivu ] | Zevachim 32a:7 | One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even with</b> regard to <b>slaughter,</b> that only priests are fit to slaughter an offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall present [<i>vehikrivu</i>]</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5), from which it is inferred that specifically <b>from</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of the priesthood.</b> This <b>teaches about the</b> rite of <b>slaughter that it is valid</b> <i>ab initio</i> if performed <b>by any person.</b> This contradicts the inference from the mishna that slaughter of an offering by a non-priest is valid only after the fact. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord” | Zevachim 32b:2 | The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Shimon HaTimni,</b> who holds that the one who slaughters an offering must stand inside the Temple courtyard. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that when the verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:5),it teaches that the bull must be inside the Temple courtyard, <b>but the slaughterer</b> need <b>not</b> be <b>“before the Lord.”</b> Therefore, he may stand outside the Temple courtyard and slaughter the offering that is inside. <b>Shimon HaTimni says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the hands of</b> the <b>slaughterer must be</b> farther <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>than the</b> animal that is <b>slaughtered? The verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord,”</b> which teaches that the <b>slaughterer of the bull must be before the Lord.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:5 | as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull before the Lord” | Zevachim 47a:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares</b> in the case <b>of consecrated</b> items, i.e., if one slaughtered an offering without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, but rather like one occupied with other matters, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to Shmuel: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), teaching that the mitzva is not performed properly <b>unless the slaughter is for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., knowing that he is performing an act of slaughter. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | shall present [ vehikrivu ] | Zevachim 4a:16 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice [<i>vehikriv</i>] the whole,</b> and make it smoke <b>upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>conveying</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the offering <b>to the ramp</b> of the altar. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall present [<i>vehikrivu</i>]</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5), that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>collection of the blood. And</b> one can infer that <b>the Merciful One expresses</b> collection of the blood <b>in the</b> same <b>language</b> used for <b>conveying, to say that you should not exclude conveying from the category of collection</b> of the blood. Therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of collection apply to conveying. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | around | Zevachim 53b:5 | The Gemara comments: This dispute between Rav and Shmuel is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest <b>should sprinkle one sprinkling</b> with the blood of a burnt offering. To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states:</b> “And sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar that is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:5). <b>If</b> the blood must be sprinkled <b>around</b> the altar, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should circumscribe</b> the altar <b>as</b> one would do with <b>a thread,</b> and sprinkle the blood all around. To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states:</b> “Shall present the blood, <b>and sprinkle</b> the blood around against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), and one cannot have the blood circumscribe the altar as a thread would without directly applying it with a finger. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? He applies the blood in a shape that is <b>similar to</b> that of the Greek letter <b>gamma, and its blood requires two sprinklings that are four.</b> This opinion accords with the opinion of Shmuel. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | around | Zevachim 53b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: It is stated here:</b> “Shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the sin offering sacrificed at the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the corners of the altar <b>around</b> with his finger” (Leviticus 8:15). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the sin offering, the blood was placed <b>discretely and</b> with <b>four placements,</b> one on each corner, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a burnt offering, it must be placed <b>discretely and</b> with <b>four placements.</b> This opinion accords with the opinion of Rav. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | around | Zevachim 57a:3 | <b>Abaye says: Why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write:</b> “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), <b>with regard to a burnt offering,</b> to teach that the blood must be placed on all four sides of the altar, in addition to writing: “And Moses took the blood, and put it upon the corners of the altar <b>around</b> with his finger” (Leviticus 8:15), <b>with regard to a sin offering? They are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they teach the same matter; <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. Therefore, a firstborn offering, an animal tithe offering, and a Paschal offering do not require two placements that are four. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | a hairbreadth, because it is stated: “Roundabout” | Zevachim 62b:14 | § The Gemara continues discussing the ramp: <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> There were <b>two small ramps protruding from the</b> main <b>ramp</b> that led to the altar, <b>on which</b> the priests could <b>turn to the base</b> of the altar <b>and to the surrounding ledge</b> of the altar. They were <b>separated from the altar</b> by <b>a hairbreadth, because it is stated: “Roundabout”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), with regard to the altar. This indicates that nothing is attached to the entire perimeter of the altar. <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says</b> there is a different source, as it states: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), and if the ramps would be connected to the altar it would no longer be square. |
| Leviticus 1:5 | “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood” | Zevachim 81a:10 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses a verse describing a burnt offering: <b>“And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). The superfluous second mention of the blood teaches that it is still called the blood of a burnt offering even after it was mixed with other blood, and therefore it should be sprinkled in its proper manner. <b>What</b> does it mean when |
| Leviticus 1:6 | and cut it into its pieces” | Chullin 11a:6 | Rabbi Elazar’s answer was as follows: It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the head of a burnt offering,</b> that one severs it from the animal’s body but does not cut it into smaller pieces, <b>as the verse states:</b> “And he shall flay the burnt offering <b>and cut it into its pieces”</b> (Leviticus 1:6), and it is inferred: The animal is cut <b>into its pieces, but its pieces,</b> including its head, are <b>not</b> cut <b>into pieces.</b> Rabbi Elazar suggested: <b>And</b> since the head is not cut and cannot be examined, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the brain membrane was perforated,</b> which would render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rather,</b> is the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>? |
| Leviticus 1:6 | that it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it | Chullin 27a:15 | Rabbi Ḥiyya explains: <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “The head, and the fat.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The head, and the fat”? Weren’t the head and the fat</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>category of all the pieces,</b> mentioned earlier in the verse? <b>For what</b> purpose did <b>they emerge</b> from the category and warrant individual mention? This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it</b> into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6). One might have thought that <b>I have</b> derived that <b>only the pieces that are</b> included <b>in the category of flaying</b> must be arranged on the altar. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed</b> when the animal was slaughtered, and is not flayed? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “With its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them” (Leviticus 1:12). |
| Leviticus 1:6 | by a non-priest? | Yoma 26b:16 | <b>Ḥizkiya said: From where</b> is it derived that they are <b>equal</b> with regard to <b>their flaying and cutting?</b> From where is it derived that flaying and cutting of offerings, whether individual or communal, may be performed <b>by a non-priest?</b> At first it is stated with regard to the burnt-offering: “And he shall flay the burnt-offering and cut it into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6), and following that <b>it is stated: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall place fire on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7). The fact that the sons of Aaron are mentioned in the verse about putting fire on the altar but not in the verse about flaying and cutting teaches that <b>placing fire</b> on the altar <b>requires priesthood,</b> i.e., it must be performed by priests, but <b>flaying and cutting do not require priesthood.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:6 | But with regard to a burnt offering it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces” | Zevachim 103b:7 | <b>But with regard to a burnt offering it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces”</b> (Leviticus 1:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that, because all the flesh of the burnt offering is burned on the altar, <b>the priests have no right to its hide.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “The priest shall have to himself <b>the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed”</b> (Leviticus 7:8). |
| Leviticus 1:6 | and cut it | Zevachim 85a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna to be referring? You interpreted it as referring <b>to disqualified</b> offerings. <b>Say the latter clause: And likewise, a burnt offering that ascended to the top of the altar alive shall descend.</b> But if <b>one slaughtered</b> the animal <b>at the top of the altar, he should flay</b> it <b>and cut</b> it <b>into pieces in its place,</b> and it is not removed from the altar. <b>And if</b> the mishna is referring to <b>a disqualified</b> offering one must ask: Is a disqualified offering <b>fit for flaying and cutting? The Merciful One states:</b> “And he shall flay the burnt offering, <b>and cut it</b> into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6), and the word <b>“it”</b> indicates an exclusion: Only <b>fit</b> offerings are flayed and cut, <b>and not</b> those that are <b>disqualified.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:7 | “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, | Eruvin 63a:15 | The Gemara asks: Is the disciple <b>not</b> liable to receive the death penalty if he issues his ruling <b>not in</b> the teacher’s <b>presence? But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The sons of Aaron died only because they issued a halakhic ruling before Moses, their teacher? What did they expound</b> in support of their conclusion that they must bring fire inside as opposed to waiting for fire to come down from the heavens? It is stated in the Torah: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar,</b> and lay the wood in order on the fire” (Leviticus 1:7), which led <b>them</b> to <b>say: Although fire descends from Heaven,</b> it is nonetheless <b>a mitzva to bring ordinary</b> fire. Although they derived this from the verses, they were punished for ruling in the presence of their teacher. |
| Leviticus 1:7 | “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar” | Yoma 21b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>When we said</b> that the smoke was not displaced, indicating that the wood produced smoke, that was in reference to the fire brought by a <b>person, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), indicating that <b>even though fire descends from the heavens,</b> still there is a special <b>mitzva to bring fire by a person.</b> The fire that the priests brought produced smoke, and the miracle related to that smoke. |
| Leviticus 1:7 | “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar and lay out wood in order upon the fire” | Yoma 24b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> kindling a fire really <b>not</b> considered a Temple service? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar and lay out wood in order upon the fire”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which <b>teaches that the kindling of chips [<i>alita</i>]</b> added to keep the altar’s fire going must <b>be performed only by a proper priest and</b> that he must be wearing <b>the priestly garments?</b> This shows that kindling is considered a service. The Gemara answers: <b>Kindling</b> the <b>chips is a</b> bona fide <b>service,</b> but <b>lighting</b> the candelabrum is <b>not</b> a bona fide <b>service.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:7 | it is stated: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall place fire on the altar” | Yoma 26b:16 | <b>Ḥizkiya said: From where</b> is it derived that they are <b>equal</b> with regard to <b>their flaying and cutting?</b> From where is it derived that flaying and cutting of offerings, whether individual or communal, may be performed <b>by a non-priest?</b> At first it is stated with regard to the burnt-offering: “And he shall flay the burnt-offering and cut it into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6), and following that <b>it is stated: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall place fire on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7). The fact that the sons of Aaron are mentioned in the verse about putting fire on the altar but not in the verse about flaying and cutting teaches that <b>placing fire</b> on the altar <b>requires priesthood,</b> i.e., it must be performed by priests, but <b>flaying and cutting do not require priesthood.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:7 | etzim | Yoma 26b:6 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the daily afternoon offering requires</b> that <b>two logs</b> be brought along with it, and that they must be brought <b>by two priests? As it is stated</b> with regard to the burnt-offering: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar <b>and lay out wood</b> [<b><i>etzim</i></b>] in order upon the fire” (Leviticus 1:7). The word <i>etzim</i> is plural, which teaches that two logs are called for. <b>If this is not applicable to the daily morning offering, as it is</b> already <b>written about</b> the morning offering explicitly: <b>“And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and arrange</b> the burnt-offering <b>on it”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), <b>apply it to the daily afternoon offering.</b> The verse therefore teaches us that two logs should be added before that offering. |
| Leviticus 1:7 | shall put | Yoma 27a:11 | The Gemara reviews the lessons taught by the other verses cited above. When the Torah writes: <b>“The priest shall bring all of it near…the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp,</b> and the verse comes to exclude other, similar actions, teaching that although <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp requires priesthood, carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. Therefore,</b> it is derived from here as well that the <b>arrangement of the two logs does require priesthood,</b> as explained above. And when the Torah writes: “The sons of Aaron <b>shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7), this is necessary <b>for its own sake,</b> to teach that this service must be done by priests. |
| Leviticus 1:7 | “The sons of Aaron shall put | Yoma 27a:3 | Abaye asked: <b>Since,</b> as this <i>baraita</i> establishes, <b>from the collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood, why do I</b> need the Torah to say afterward: <b>“The sons of Aaron shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7)? Since the verse about putting the fire on the altar follows the verse about collection of blood, it is clear that it must be done by priests, and the verse’s stipulation of this fact appears superfluous. This is why Ḥizkiya concluded that the verse is not required for its own sake but is needed to teach the following inference: It is only the placing of fire on the altar that requires priests, <b>to the exclusion of flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest. |
| Leviticus 1:7 | “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar” | Yoma 45a:12 | <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> derive that the <b>kindling of the wood chips</b> should be at the top of the altar? <b>He derives it from the</b> same <b>place</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon derives it. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which <b>teaches about the kindling of</b> the <b>wood chips that it may be</b> done <b>only by a fit priest and</b> one who is robed <b>in</b> the priestly <b>vestments of service;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon said to him:</b> There is no need for a verse to teach that a priest must kindle the chips, <b>for could it enter your mind that a non-priest could approach the altar? Rather,</b> this verse <b>teaches</b> about the <b>kindling of the wood chips, that they may be lit only at the top of the altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:7 | “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar” | Yoma 53a:20 | The Gemara answers: They were not punished for their entry into the sacred place but for a different reason, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Aaron’s sons died only because they taught a <i>halakha</i> before Moses their teacher;</b> they should have asked him for his ruling, but they neglected to do so. The Gemara asks: <b>What did they interpret</b> from the verse that led them to enter the sacred place with fire? The verse states: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which indicates that <b>although fire descends from the heavens,</b> it is a <b>mitzva to bring man-made</b> fire. To fulfill this mitzva, Aaron’s sons entered and brought fire to the altar. Although their ruling was in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, they incurred the death penalty for failing to ask Moses. |
| Leviticus 1:7 | It is derived from there: “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put | Zevachim 18a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Still,</b> is the disqualification of rites performed by one lacking the requisite vestments <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., from the verse: “And you shall gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons” (Exodus 29:9)? <b>It is derived from there: “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put</b> fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:7). The superfluous term “the priest” serves to indicate that he may serve only <b>in his priestly state.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches</b> that <b>with regard to a High Priest who wore the vestments of an ordinary priest and performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites, his service is disqualified.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:7 | not | Zevachim 18a:8 | The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> one derived the <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there, I would say: This matter</b> applies only to <b>service that is indispensable for</b> effecting <b>atonement. But service that is not indispensable for</b> effecting <b>atonement,</b> e.g., putting fire upon the altar, is <b>not</b> subject to the <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, the verse (Leviticus 1:7) indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies even to rites that are not indispensable. |
| Leviticus 1:8 | the priests, | Bekhorot 43b:12 | The Gemara notes: <b>Who is this <i>tanna</i></b> who says that such priests are fit by Torah law? <b>It is Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> When the verse states: “And Aaron’s sons, <b>the priests,</b> shall lay the pieces” (Leviticus 1:8), this serves <b>to include the bald</b> priests in the performance of the Temple service. |
| Leviticus 1:8 | as it is stated: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall arrange the pieces, | Chullin 27a:14 | <b>And a <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>cites</b> the source for the <i>halakha</i> that slaughter is performed from the neck <b>from here: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to slaughter that it is</b> performed <b>from the neck?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall arrange the pieces,</b> the head, and the fat…upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8). |
| Leviticus 1:8 | “The head, and the fat” | Chullin 27a:17 | The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>opened with</b> a question about the extraneous phrase written with regard to a bull burnt offering: <b>“The head, and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8), <b>and concludes with</b> an explanation of the phrase written with regard to a sheep burnt offering: <b>“Its head and its fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:12). The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The head, and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8). |
| Leviticus 1:8 | fat that the Merciful One writes: | Chullin 27b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>the first</b> mention of <b>fat that the Merciful One writes:</b> “The pieces, the head, and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8)? Wasn’t the derivation from that verse restricted to the head? The Gemara answers that it is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does</b> the priest who elevates the sacrificial portions of the animal to the altar <b>perform</b> that task? <b>He</b> uses <b>the fat</b> to <b>cover the place of slaughter,</b> i.e., to conceal the bloody neck, <b>and elevates</b> the head to the top of the altar, <b>and that is a deferential manner</b> toward <b>the Most High.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:8 | the head of a burnt offering, | Chullin 90a:17 | The Gemara explains their dispute: <b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that with regard to sinews and bones that <b>are attached</b> to the flesh it <b>was not necessary</b> for <b>a verse to include</b> the obligation to bring them up to the altar. It is clear that they must be brought up, <b>just as it is</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the head of a burnt offering,</b> which contains many bones, is brought up, as stated explicitly in the verse: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire that is upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8). <b>When a verse was necessary</b> it was <b>for</b> the case where the sinews and bones <b>became detached</b> from the flesh. Consequently, when the verse uses the inclusive phrase “it all,” it is to include sinews and bones that became detached. |
| Leviticus 1:8 | upon the wood | Menachot 26b:19 | <b>Ḥizkiyya raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>limbs</b> of the burnt offering <b>that</b> a priest <b>arranged</b> on the altar <b>and arranged the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar <b>on top of them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces and the head, and the fat, in order <b>upon the wood</b> that is on the fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8), teaching that they must be placed <b>specifically upon the wood? Or perhaps, since it is written</b> in <b>another verse: “That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that the burnt offering may be arranged directly on the altar, <b>if</b> the priest <b>desires</b> to arrange the limbs in <b>this</b> manner he may <b>do</b> so, <b>and if</b> he <b>desires</b> to arrange them in <b>that</b> manner he may also <b>do</b> so. The Gemara comments: No answer was found, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 1:8 | fat | Yoma 25b:16 | The Gemara asks further: Although the Sages disagree as to the order of bringing up the various pieces, <b>at any rate everyone agrees</b> that the <b>head is sacrificed first. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when sacrificing an animal <b>the head and the fat precede all the</b> other <b>limbs? The verse states:</b> “And he shall cut it up into its pieces <b>and its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:12). The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> mention of <b>fat</b> before this, where the verse states: “The pieces, the head and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8), |
| Leviticus 1:8 | “On the wood that is on the fire upon the altar” | Yoma 27a:13 | <b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar posed a difficulty: This</b> verse <b>is written</b> about a young bull, not a lamb; and a <b>bull requires twenty-four</b> priests. How, then, can this verse be used as the source that six priests are required to carry the limbs of a lamb? And <b>he resolved</b> the difficulty himself as follows: The same verse states: <b>“On the wood that is on the fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:8), all of which apparently teaches nothing new about the sacrifice. Therefore, it is seen as an allusion to the daily offering, which was a lamb, as <b>what is an item about which it is stated that</b> specially prepared <b>wood and fire</b> on an <b>altar</b> must be provided, and that pre-existing wood and fire do not suffice? |
| Leviticus 1:8 | “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat” | Yoma 27a:5 | <b>Rather,</b> Hizkiya’s derivation must be rejected, and the acceptability of non-priests for flaying and cutting the animal must be learned <b>from here:</b> It is written: <b>“And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8). <b>Since,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> above establishes, <b>from the collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood, why do I</b> need the verse to specify: <b>“And</b> Aaron’s sons <b>shall lay out</b> the pieces”? Since the specification of priesthood here appears superfluous, one must conclude that it is written not for its own sake but <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, to teach that those acts need not be performed by a priest. |
| Leviticus 1:8 | It is derived from there: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall lay the pieces, | Zevachim 18a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., from all of the previous sources? <b>It is derived from there: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall lay the pieces,</b> and the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire, which is upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8). The superfluous term <b>“the priests”</b> serves to indicate that the priests may serve only <b>in their priestly state. From here</b> one derives that <b>with regard to an ordinary priest who wore the vestments of</b> the <b>High Priest and performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites, his service is disqualified.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:8 | “Upon the wood that is on the fire that is upon the altar” | Zevachim 62b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> The length and width of the logs men-tioned were measured <b>with a shortened cubit. Rav Yosef said: Is this not as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Upon the wood that is on the fire that is upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:8). The seemingly superfluous phrase “that is upon the altar” teaches <b>that the wood should not extend at all beyond</b> the area of <b>the altar</b> designated for the arrangement of wood. Since this area was one square cubit, the logs were exactly one cubit as well. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “And the priest shall make it all smoke on the altar” | Chullin 90a:11 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> disagreed with Rav Pappa and <b>said:</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree</b> with regard to whether it is permitted <b>to bring up</b> the sciatic nerve to the altar even when it remains in the thigh. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse: <b>“And the priest shall make it all smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), the term “it all” serves <b>to include the bones, and the sinews, and the horns, and the hooves</b> among those items burned on the altar. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | It is stated with regard to an animal burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing | Menachot 110a:14 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a bird burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:2). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing | Menachot 110a:18 | <b>And it is stated with regard to a large bull</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a small bird</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “And if his offering is of the flock” | Menachot 91a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>Isn’t it written: “If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), and then in a separate verse it states: <b>“And if his offering is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:9)? The fact that these possibilities are presented in two disjointed verses is an explicit indication that the burnt offering can be brought from even just one of these animals. Therefore, even Rabbi Yoshiya concedes that there is no reason to presume a burnt offering must be brought from both types there. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | It is stated with regard to an animal burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma” | Shevuot 15a:8 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>Is</b> the size of the offering <b>of</b> any <b>importance before Heaven? But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 110a): <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a bird burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:17), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a meal-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The same term is used in all three cases even though the three offerings are of different value. This <b>teaches that one who brings a substantial</b> sacrifice <b>and one who brings a modest</b> sacrifice have equal merit, and both offerings are accepted as having a pleasing aroma, <b>provided that one directs his heart to his Father in Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar” | Yoma 27a:10 | <b>Rather,</b> this derivation must be rejected as well, and another verse must be found from which to prove that non-priests may flay and cut up the animal. The Torah states: <b>“And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9). Since this is an act following the collection of the blood, the specification of priesthood is not needed for its own sake. Therefore, <b>for what</b> purpose does that verse <b>come?</b> It comes <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “With water” | Zevachim 22a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the water in the Basin <b>does not</b> need to be <b>flowing water,</b> i.e., spring water? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse indicates that the innards of an offering must be washed: <b>“With water”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and not with wine; “with water,” and not with</b> wine <b>mixed</b> with water; <b>“with water,” to include other</b> types of <b>water,</b> even those that are not spring water. <b>And</b> it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that <b>the water</b> used <b>for</b> the <b>Basin</b> may be used to wash the innards. <b>What</b> is the basis of the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that <b>the water</b> used <b>for the Basin</b> may also be used? Is it <b>not that it is</b> from a source of <b>flowing water</b> and therefore obviously fit for washing the innards? |
| Leviticus 1:9 | Rav says | Zevachim 46b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> with regard to the verse: “A burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), the term <b>“a burnt offering”</b> means that one must intend that it be <b>for the sake of a burnt offering, to the exclusion of</b> one who sacrifices a burnt offering <b>for the sake of a peace offering, which</b> one may <b>not</b> do. The mention of <b>fires,</b> i.e., the term “an offering made by fire,” teaches that the offering must be sacrificed <b>for the sake of</b> complete consumption by the <b>fires</b> of the altar, <b>to the exclusion of</b> one who intends that its portions should only be <b>roasted</b> on the fire, <b>as</b> one may <b>not</b> do so. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | as it is stated: “And the priest shall make the whole smoke | Zevachim 85b:16 | With regard to <b>the wool that is on the heads of the sheep</b> brought as burnt offerings, <b>and the hair that is in the beard of goats</b> that were sacrificed, <b>and the bones, and the tendons, and the horns, and the hooves: When they are attached</b> to the flesh of the offering <b>they shall ascend</b> upon the altar and be sacrificed with the offering, <b>as it is stated: “And the priest shall make the whole smoke</b> on the altar” (Leviticus 1:9). If <b>they separated</b> from the flesh of the offering <b>they shall not ascend, as it is stated: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), and nothing else. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar” | Zevachim 85b:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9). The term “the whole” serves <b>to include the bones and the tendons and the horns and the hooves</b> among those items that are sacrificed on the altar. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>they separated</b> from the flesh of the burnt offering they are sacrificed upon the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), indicating that only those items and anything attached to them are sacrificed upon the altar. |
| Leviticus 1:9 | “And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar” | Zevachim 86a:2 | The Gemara notes: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> that you heard that says</b> if <b>they separated they shall descend? It is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9); the term “the whole” serves <b>to include the bones, and the tendons, and the horns, and the hooves,</b> among those items that are offered on the altar, <b>even</b> if <b>they separated</b> from the flesh of the offering. |
| Leviticus 1:10 | from [ min ] the flock, whether from the sheep or from the goats” | Bekhorot 41a:11 | § Among the conditions that are not considered full-fledged blemishes, but one may not sacrifice an animal with one such condition as an offering either, the mishna lists: <b>And an old</b> animal, <b>or a sick</b> animal, <b>or</b> one with <b>a foul odor.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And if his offering be <b>from [<i>min</i>] the flock, whether from the sheep or from the goats”</b> (Leviticus 1:10). These three instances of the word “from [<i>min</i>]” serve to <b>exclude the old, and the sick, and the</b> animal with <b>a foul odor,</b> which may not be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 1:10 | “A male” | Bekhorot 41b:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>. It states with regard to a burnt offering from cattle: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), from which it can be inferred: <b>But not a female. When it says below,</b> with regard to a burnt offering from sheep: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:10), a second time, it is difficult to understand, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> “a male” again? This serves <b>to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> which are disqualified from being sacrificed as burnt offerings. |
| Leviticus 1:10 | “A male” | Bekhorot 42a:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to a burnt offering from cattle: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), from which it can be inferred: <b>But not a female. When it says below,</b> with regard to a burnt offering from sheep: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:10), a second time, it is difficult to understand, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> “a male” again? This serves <b>to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> which are disqualified as burnt offerings. The Gemara answers: <b>Omit from</b> this <i>baraita</i> the mention of <b>a <i>tumtum</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:10 | since the verse opens with it first | Menachot 105a:2 | Similarly, one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering <b>from the flock, must bring a lamb</b> as his burnt offering, <b>since the verse opens with it first</b> in the passage discussing burnt offerings of the flock, as it is stated: “And if his offering is of the flock, whether of the lambs, or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish” (Leviticus 1:10). |
| Leviticus 1:10 | from this verse: | Nazir 35a:6 | <b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>derives</b> the method of a detail, a generalization, and a detail <b>from this verse:</b> “And if his offering is from the flock, whether of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish” (Leviticus 1:10). The phrase <b>“and if</b> his offering is <b>from”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> as it indicates part but not all of something, <b>“the flock”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> that includes animals that have been used sinfully, and when it stated: <b>“Sheep,” and: “Goats,”</b> the Torah has <b>detailed again.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:10 | flock” | Zevachim 34a:17 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> again: “From the <b>cattle”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>and:</b> “From the <b>flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:10), to reiterate that God says: <b>I have told you</b> to bring offerings from the <b>cattle and</b> the <b>flock, but not an undomesticated animal. To what is this comparable? To a student whose teacher told him: Bring me only wheat, and</b> the student <b>brought him wheat and barley. It is not as</b> though the student is <b>adding to the statement of</b> the teacher; <b>rather, it is as</b> though <b>he is disobeying his statement,</b> since his teacher instructed him to bring only wheat. Consequently, one who sacrifices an undomesticated animal does not merely add to a mitzva of the Torah, but also violates a prohibition, |
| Leviticus 1:10 | of the flock, | Zevachim 48a:5 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>We have found</b> that this verse provides a source that <b>a young sheep</b> burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a young bull</b> burnt offering must also be slaughtered in the north? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “And if</b> his offering be <b>of the flock,</b> whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish” (Leviticus 1:10). The conjunctive “and” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter.</b> The previous passage addresses cattle offerings. <b>And let</b> the <b>upper</b> passage, the place of the slaughter of a bull, <b>be learned from</b> the <b>lower</b> passage, the place of slaughtering a sheep. |
| Leviticus 1:11 | established a priest for its sprinkling, | Kiddushin 36b:3 | The Gemara explains <b>that this is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a sheep</b> offering: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>a sheep</b> offering, concerning <b>which</b> the Torah <b>did not establish a priest for its slaughter,</b> since it may be slaughtered by anybody, the Torah nevertheless <b>established a priest for its sprinkling,</b> as the verse states: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood” (Leviticus 1:11), <b>is it not logical</b> that with regard to <b>a bird</b>-offering, concerning <b>which</b> the Torah <b>established a priest for its pinching,</b> an act parallel to slaughtering a sheep, the Torah likewise <b>established a priest for its sprinkling?</b> This proves that the sprinkling of the blood of a bird-offering can be performed only by priests, not by women. |
| Leviticus 1:11 | Where is the burnt offering slaughtered? On the northern | Menachot 55b:10 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raises an objection, and some say</b> that this objection is <b>unattributed [<i>kedi</i>]: And</b> is it correct that in the case of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another, one cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>them by</b> analyzing them as <b>a generalization and a detail? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a goat brought by a king as a sin offering: The verse states: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, <b>and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:24). <b>Where is the burnt offering slaughtered? On the northern</b> side of the Temple courtyard, as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:11). <b>This</b> sin offering of a king must consequently <b>also</b> be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 1:11 | “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward | Menachot 56a:6 | The Gemara challenges this: The <i>halakha</i> of the one who slaughters has already been <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Aḥiyya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Aḥiyya says:</b> The verse states with regard to the burnt offering: <b>“And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward</b> before God” (Leviticus 1:11). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the exclusionary term “it”? |
| Leviticus 1:11 | and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar” | Pesachim 64b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that their blood <b>requires</b> sprinkling upon the altar on a side that has a <b>base? Rabbi Elazar said: This is derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between the word <b>sprinkling</b> used here and the word <b>sprinkling</b> used <b>with regard to a burnt-offering. Here, it is written: “You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar;” there, it is written</b> with regard to a burnt-offering: “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord; <b>and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:11). <b>Just as</b> the blood of a <b>burnt-offering must</b> be sprinkled on the altar in a place where there is <b>a base, so too,</b> the blood of a <b>Paschal lamb must</b> be sprinkled in a place where there is <b>a base.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:11 | north | Yoma 36a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that when the High Priest recites his confession, the bull stands between the Entrance Hall to the Sanctuary and the altar, and elsewhere (41b) it is stated that the bull is slaughtered at the place where the confession is recited. Apparently, the place where the confession is recited must be considered north. The Gemara clarifies: About <b>whom did you learn that he said</b> that the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar</b> is considered <b>north</b> and is therefore a valid location for slaughtering offerings of the most sacred order, based on the verse written with regard to the burnt-offering: “On the side of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:11)? |
| Leviticus 1:11 | northward before God” | Yoma 37a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it says</b> in the mishna that the priest comes <b>to</b> the <b>north of the altar,</b> it can be learned <b>by inference that</b> the <b>altar</b> itself <b>does not stand in the north</b> but in the south of the courtyard. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that from the verse: “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar <b>northward before God”</b> (Leviticus 1:11), it is derived <b>that</b> the <b>entire north</b> side should <b>be vacant.</b> The altar is in the south, and the north is vacant. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:11 | northward before the Lord” | Zevachim 119b:14 | The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>slaughtering</b> offerings of the most sacred order in the <b>north</b> is <b>as it is written:</b> “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar <b>northward before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:11). The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>placement</b> of the blood of a burnt offering <b>around,</b> i.e., on all four sides of, the altar, is <b>as it is written: “And</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall…sprinkle</b> the blood <b>roundabout against the altar</b> that is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:5). |
| Leviticus 1:11 | with regard to a burnt offering | Zevachim 48a:1 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur,</b> their slaughter is in the north and the collection of their blood in a service vessel is in the north. The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna list these sin offerings first? <b>After all,</b> while the <i>halakha</i> that slaughter must be in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>is written</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to a burnt offering</b> (Leviticus 1:11), the Torah does not explicitly state that the other offerings must be slaughtered in the north. Therefore, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a burnt offering first.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:11 | “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward | Zevachim 48a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> is it <b>written</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> must be slaughtered in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers that with regard to a sheep that is brought as a burnt offering the Torah states: <b>“And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward</b> before the Lord; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about” (Leviticus 1:11). |
| Leviticus 1:11 | “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward | Zevachim 48b:13 | The Gemara challenges this: The <i>halakha</i> of the one who <b>slaughters</b> the offering has already been <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Aḥiyya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Aḥiyya says:</b> The verse states with regard to the burnt offering: <b>“And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:11). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the exclusionary term “it”? |
| Leviticus 1:11 | “on the side | Zevachim 58a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei used to say: The entire altar stands in the north</b> section of the Temple courtyard. The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yosei’s statement that if one slaughtered offerings of the most sacred order atop the altar it is <b>as though</b> they were slaughtered in the north, which indicates that they were not actually slaughtered in the north? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yosei said this <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we require</b> that the offering be slaughtered <b>“on the side</b> of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:11), i.e., on the ground beside the altar, <b>and</b> that requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled when it is slaughtered on top of the altar. Therefore, Rabbi Yosei <b>teaches us</b> that the offering is still valid. |
| Leviticus 1:11 | northward [ tzafona ]” | Zevachim 59a:8 | The Gemara answers: That suggestion is technically not feasible, as <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar <b>northward [<i>tzafona</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 1:11). This verse indicates <b>that the north</b> section of the Temple courtyard must <b>be vacant of</b> all <b>vessels,</b> including the Basin. This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of Rav Sherevya’s assertion that the mishna in <i>Tamid</i>, which holds that the altar was located in the northern part of the Temple courtyard, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. |
| Leviticus 1:11 | “Northward | Zevachim 59a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Yosei HaGelili?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:</b> The verse states: <b>“Northward</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:11). This indicates <b>that the north</b> section of the Temple courtyard must <b>be vacant of everything, and even of the altar.</b> Therefore, he maintains that the entire altar stood in the southern section of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 1:11 | Rav Huna said: The verse states: “And he shall slaughter it on the side [ yerekh ] of the altar northward” | Zevachim 62b:4 | § The Gemara discusses the ramp of the altar: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 36a): <b>There was a ramp</b> that was located <b>on the south</b> side <b>of the altar,</b> whose size was <b>a length</b> of <b>thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by a width</b> of <b>sixteen</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., from where is it derived that the ramp is on the south side of the altar? <b>Rav Huna said: The verse states: “And he shall slaughter it on the side [<i>yerekh</i>] of the altar northward”</b> (Leviticus 1:11), which teaches <b>that</b> the altar’s <b>thigh [<i>yarekh</i>] should be</b> located <b>in the north, and its face,</b> i.e., the front of the altar where the priests ascend to it, should be <b>in the south.</b> The verse likens the positioning of the altar to a person who is lying down flat, in which case if his legs are to the north, his face is to the south. |
| Leviticus 1:12 | shall arrange | Chullin 27a:15 | Rabbi Ḥiyya explains: <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “The head, and the fat.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The head, and the fat”? Weren’t the head and the fat</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>category of all the pieces,</b> mentioned earlier in the verse? <b>For what</b> purpose did <b>they emerge</b> from the category and warrant individual mention? This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it</b> into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6). One might have thought that <b>I have</b> derived that <b>only the pieces that are</b> included <b>in the category of flaying</b> must be arranged on the altar. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed</b> when the animal was slaughtered, and is not flayed? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “With its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them” (Leviticus 1:12). |
| Leviticus 1:12 | “Its head and its fat” | Chullin 27a:17 | The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>opened with</b> a question about the extraneous phrase written with regard to a bull burnt offering: <b>“The head, and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8), <b>and concludes with</b> an explanation of the phrase written with regard to a sheep burnt offering: <b>“Its head and its fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:12). The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The head, and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8). |
| Leviticus 1:12 | shall arrange | Chullin 27a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse cited at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Its head and its fat”?</b> The Gemara answers: The verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that the head and the fat precede all the</b> other <b>pieces</b>when the sacrificial portions are sacrificed on the altar? <b>The verse states: “With its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them” (Leviticus 1:12). |
| Leviticus 1:12 | “On the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar” | Menachot 22a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>wood,</b> concerning <b>which</b> it is <b>obvious to the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> it is brought <b>from communal</b> supplies, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must bring wood from his home</b> on which the burnt offering will be sacrificed, <b>just as he brings libations from his home</b> along with a burnt offering (see Numbers, chapter 15). Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the burnt offering: <b>“On the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:12); the Torah juxtaposes the wood to the altar, teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>altar</b> was built <b>from communal</b> funds, <b>so too,</b> the <b>wood and fire</b> are brought <b>from communal</b> supplies. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:12 | shall arrange | Yoma 25b:16 | The Gemara asks further: Although the Sages disagree as to the order of bringing up the various pieces, <b>at any rate everyone agrees</b> that the <b>head is sacrificed first. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when sacrificing an animal <b>the head and the fat precede all the</b> other <b>limbs? The verse states:</b> “And he shall cut it up into its pieces <b>and its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:12). The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> mention of <b>fat</b> before this, where the verse states: “The pieces, the head and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8), |
| Leviticus 1:13 | As it is written: “And the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar” | Chagigah 11a:10 | <b>And the Merciful One expressed</b> collecting the blood <b>in the language of carrying,</b> i.e., by means of the term offer. <b>As it is written: “And the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13). <b>And the Master said</b> that this term, “offer,” is not referring to sacrificing on the altar, as that is expressed by the phrase: “Make it smoke upon the altar.” Rather, <b>this is</b> referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp</b> next to the altar, from where it is placed on the altar itself. |
| Leviticus 1:13 | But isn’t it written: “And the priest shall offer it whole and make it smoke upon the altar” | Eruvin 104a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this <b>not</b> a service? <b>But isn’t it written: “And the priest shall offer it whole and make it smoke upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> in explanation: <b>This</b> is referring to <b>bringing the limbs to</b> the top of <b>the ramp.</b> Evidently, this too is a service written in the Torah. <b>Rather, say</b> that he scatters the salt <b>when the wood is brought</b> up the ramp <b>to the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar, a procedure <b>that is not a service.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:13 | upon the altar” | Menachot 10a:14 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: But this is contradicted by the verse discussing <b>the conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the daily burnt offering <b>to the ramp</b> of the altar, <b>as priesthood is written with regard to it, as it is written: “And the priest shall sacrifice the whole</b> and make it smoke <b>upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> that <b>this</b> verse is referring to <b>the conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs to the ramp. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 31b): When the priest conveys the limbs to the ramp, <b>the foot of</b> the <b>right</b> side of the offering is carried <b>in</b> the <b>left</b> hand of the priest, <b>and the place of its skin,</b> i.e., the side of the limb covered in skin, is held facing <b>outward.</b> Clearly, use of the left hand does not disqualify the conveyance of the limbs. |
| Leviticus 1:13 | upon the altar; | Pesachim 65b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it <b>not</b> one of the rites? <b>But from the fact that</b> this task <b>requires priesthood,</b> as it can be performed only by a priest, the implication is that <b>it is</b> considered <b>a rite. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the priest shall bring it all</b> and burn it <b>upon the altar;</b> it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a satisfying aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:13), that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the carrying of the limbs to the ramp. Rather,</b> we must say that the priests would walk in the blood <b>while carrying wood to the wood pile</b> on the altar, <b>which is not a rite.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:13 | “The priest shall bring all of it near…the altar” | Yoma 27a:11 | The Gemara reviews the lessons taught by the other verses cited above. When the Torah writes: <b>“The priest shall bring all of it near…the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp,</b> and the verse comes to exclude other, similar actions, teaching that although <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp requires priesthood, carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. Therefore,</b> it is derived from here as well that the <b>arrangement of the two logs does require priesthood,</b> as explained above. And when the Torah writes: “The sons of Aaron <b>shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7), this is necessary <b>for its own sake,</b> to teach that this service must be done by priests. |
| Leviticus 1:13 | “And the priest shall bring all of it near and burn it on the altar” | Yoma 27a:8 | The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as the Master said:</b> After mentioning the mitzva to collect the blood, the Torah states: <b>“And the priest shall bring all of it near and burn it on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), where bringing near is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp.</b> The specification of priesthood in this verse is not required for its own sake, since all services following the collection of blood require priesthood. Therefore, it must be that it comes to convey the inference that <b>it is</b> only <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp that requires priesthood,</b> but <b>carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. This,</b> in turn, implies that <b>the</b> actual <b>arrangement of the two logs,</b> which was not excluded, <b>does require priesthood.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:13 | “It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord” | Zevachim 12b:10 | <b>Rav Huna said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of ben Azzai?</b> The verse states: <b>“It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:13). The word <b>“it”</b> teaches that if it is sacrificed <b>for its sake,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if sacrificed <b>not for its sake,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:13 | disqualified, as it is written: “And the priest shall sacrifice the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar” | Zevachim 14b:10 | The Gemara further challenges the premise of Rabba and Rav Yosef that a dispensable rite can be performed by a non-priest: <b>But</b> what about <b>conveying</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the offering <b>to the ramp, which is a dispensable rite,</b> as the offering can be slaughtered next to the ramp? <b>And</b> nevertheless, if it is performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified, as it is written: “And the priest shall sacrifice the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13); <b>and the Master says: This</b> is referring to <b>conveying</b> the <b>limbs to the ramp.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:13 | upon the altar” | Zevachim 24b:7 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: But this is contradicted by the verse discussing <b>the conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the daily burnt offering <b>to the ramp</b> of the altar, <b>as priesthood is written with regard to it, as it is written: “And the priest shall sacrifice the whole</b> and make it smoke <b>upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> that <b>this</b> verse is referring to the <b>conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs to the ramp. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 31b): When the priest conveys the limbs to the ramp, <b>the foot of</b> the <b>right</b> side of the offering is carried <b>in the left</b> hand <b>of</b> the priest, <b>and the place of its skin,</b> i.e., the side of the limb covered in skin, is held facing <b>outward.</b> Clearly, use of the left hand does not disqualify the conveyance of the limbs. |
| Leviticus 1:13 | “And the priest shall bring it all | Zevachim 35a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it <b>not</b> one of the rites? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the priest shall bring it all</b> and burn it upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:13); <b>this is</b> referring to <b>the carrying of the limbs to the ramp? Rather,</b> the priests would walk in the blood only <b>while carrying wood to the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar, <b>which is not a rite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the floor of the Temple was full of blood; <b>how did they walk to</b> perform <b>the</b> actual <b>rites</b> without soiling their garments? The Gemara answers: <b>They would walk on platforms</b> raised above the floor, so that the blood would not reach their garments. |
| Leviticus 1:13 | upon the altar” | Zevachim 4a:16 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice [<i>vehikriv</i>] the whole,</b> and make it smoke <b>upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>conveying</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the offering <b>to the ramp</b> of the altar. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall present [<i>vehikrivu</i>]</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5), that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>collection of the blood. And</b> one can infer that <b>the Merciful One expresses</b> collection of the blood <b>in the</b> same <b>language</b> used for <b>conveying, to say that you should not exclude conveying from the category of collection</b> of the blood. Therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of collection apply to conveying. |
| Leviticus 1:14 | MISHNA: | Chullin 22a:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is written with regard to bird offerings: “He shall bring his offering of doves, or of young pigeons” (Leviticus 1:14). The age that is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in doves,</b> mature birds, is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>in pigeons,</b> immature birds;the age that is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in pigeons</b> is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>in doves.</b> At the intermediate stage of <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of its plumage (see 22b), a bird <b>is unfit</b> both <b>as this,</b> a pigeon, <b>and as that,</b> a dove, since it is no longer a fledgling but is not yet a mature bird. |
| Leviticus 1:14 | The Sages taught | Chullin 22a:15 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And he shall bring his offering of doves, or of young pigeons” (Leviticus 1:14), that <b>doves</b> are <b>older and not younger. As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>And couldn’t this</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference:</b> |
| Leviticus 1:14 | is stated about doves: “And he shall sacrifice | Keritot 9a:6 | The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>And</b> is it true that we have <b>not</b> found an offering of an individual bird anywhere in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a bird sacrificed as a burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Since</b> it <b>is stated about doves: “And he shall sacrifice</b> his offering of doves” (Leviticus 1:14), in the plural, <b>I</b> might <b>derive</b> from here that <b>the one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a bird</b> as <b>a burnt offering, shall not bring less than two young birds.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15), in the singular, to teach that one may bring a gift offering of <b>even one</b> single <b>young bird.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>In any event, we have not found an obligatory</b> offering of just one bird. |
| Leviticus 1:14 | from birds” | Kiddushin 24b:20 | The Gemara comments: One <b>might</b> have thought that if one brings a bird <b>whose wing is dried,</b> or whose <b>leg is severed,</b> or whose <b>eye was removed,</b> that it too is acceptable as an offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if his offering to the Lord is a burnt-offering <b>from birds”</b> (Leviticus 1:14). This phrase indicates that only some birds can be sacrificed as offerings, <b>but not all birds.</b> This teaches that a bird can be disqualified due to a blemish. For example, if a significant part of the bird is missing, e.g., a limb, the bird is not acceptable as an offering. This indicates that the actual loss of an eye is considered a greater blemish than blindness. Consequently, if his master takes out the slave’s blind eye, he is emancipated. |
| Leviticus 1:14 | since the verse opens with it first | Menachot 105a:3 | Similarly, one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering <b>from</b> a type of <b>bird, must bring doves</b> as his burnt offering, <b>since the verse opens with it first</b> in the passage discussing burnt offerings of birds, as it is stated: “And if his offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of doves or of pigeons” (Leviticus 1:14). |
| Leviticus 1:14 | of doves, or of pigeons” | Zevachim 65a:6 | <b>Since it is stated</b> in the preceding verse: “And if his offering to the Lord be a burnt offering of birds, <b>then he shall bring</b> his offering <b>of doves, or of pigeons”</b> (Leviticus 1:14), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who donates a bird</b> as an offering <b>may not</b> donate <b>fewer than two birds.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it,”</b> indicating that <b>one may bring even one bird to</b> be sacrificed on <b>the altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:15 | shall bring it | Chullin 21a:16 | <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only according to the ordinance of a bird sin offering?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When it says</b> with regard to the bird burnt offering brought as a gift offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15), meaning that it shall be sacrificed in a unique manner, <b>the verse distinguished between a bird sin offering and a bird burnt offering. And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“according to the ordinance”?</b> It means <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering; just as an animal sin offering comes only</b> |
| Leviticus 1:15 | and burned | Chullin 21b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps <b>just as there,</b> with regard to an animal sin offering, slaughter is valid <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, the windpipe and the gullet, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering, the pinching is valid <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And pinched off</b> its head…<b>and burned</b> it on the altar” (Leviticus 1:15). This indicates that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>burning, the head</b> is burned <b>by itself and the body</b> is burned <b>by itself, so too</b> with regard to <b>pinching, the head</b> remains <b>by itself and the body</b> remains <b>by itself.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:15 | They derive pinching | Chullin 22a:12 | It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yishmael derived from the term “according to the ordinance” that is written with regard to the bird burnt offering that the pinching of the bird burnt offering is performed at the nape of the neck, as it is in a bird sin offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who derive other matters from that term, <b>from where do they derive</b> that pinching of the bird burnt offering is performed at the nape of the neck? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive pinching</b> that is written with regard to the burnt offering: “And pinch off its head” (Leviticus 1:15), <b>from pinching</b> that is written with regard to the sin offering: “And pinch off its head adjacent to its neck” (Leviticus 5:8). |
| Leviticus 1:15 | shall sacrifice it” | Keritot 9a:6 | The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>And</b> is it true that we have <b>not</b> found an offering of an individual bird anywhere in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a bird sacrificed as a burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Since</b> it <b>is stated about doves: “And he shall sacrifice</b> his offering of doves” (Leviticus 1:14), in the plural, <b>I</b> might <b>derive</b> from here that <b>the one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a bird</b> as <b>a burnt offering, shall not bring less than two young birds.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15), in the singular, to teach that one may bring a gift offering of <b>even one</b> single <b>young bird.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>In any event, we have not found an obligatory</b> offering of just one bird. |
| Leviticus 1:15 | as it is written: “And he shall pinch…and he shall burn” | Kiddushin 36a:21 | With regard to <b>pinching,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall pinch…and he shall burn”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). The verse <b>juxtaposes killing to burning,</b> and just as the burning of an offering must be performed by men, so too pinching may be performed only by men. |
| Leviticus 1:15 | “And pinch off | Zevachim 65a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states that the priest shall <b>“pinch off</b> its head,” which must be performed <b>at the nape. Do you say</b> that the pinching occurs <b>at the nape, or</b> is it <b>only at the throat? It</b> can be derived through <b>a logical inference:</b> It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And pinch off</b> its head” (Leviticus 1:15), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there,</b> with regard to a bird sin offering: <b>“And pinch off</b> its head opposite its nape, but shall not separate it” (Leviticus 5:8). <b>Just as there,</b> the head is pinched <b>at the nape, so too here,</b> the head is pinched <b>at the nape.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:15 | and make it smoke | Zevachim 65a:12 | <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a bird burnt offering is derived from that of a bird sin offering, perhaps it should also be derived that <b>just as there,</b> the priest <b>pinches</b> off the head <b>but does not separate</b> it completely from the body, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering, he <b>pinches</b> off the head <b>but does not separate</b> it from the body. To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And pinch off</b> its head, <b>and make it smoke</b> on the altar” (Leviticus 1:15). This indicates that <b>just as</b> with regard to the <b>burning</b> of the bird burnt offering, <b>the head</b> is burned <b>by itself and the body</b> is burned <b>by itself, so too</b> with regard to the <b>pinching, the head</b> is <b>by itself and the body</b> is <b>by itself,</b> i.e., the head is completely detached from the body. |
| Leviticus 1:15 | “And make it smoke on the altar” | Zevachim 65a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that the burning of the head</b> is <b>by itself and the body</b> is burned <b>by itself? As it is stated:</b> “And he shall rend it by its wings…<b>and</b> the priest <b>shall make it smoke</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:17). Since <b>the burning of the body is stated</b> in this verse, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the earlier phrase: <b>“And make it smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:15)? One must conclude that <b>the verse is speaking about the burning of the head.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:15 | The Sages taught | Zevachim 65a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse pertaining to a bird burnt offering: “And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar” (Leviticus 1:15). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar? Since the previous verse states that “he shall bring his offering,” this verse should have started with the phrase “And he shall pinch off its head.” |
| Leviticus 1:15 | “the priest | Zevachim 65a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues analyzing the verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> that <b>“the priest</b> shall bring it to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15)? It is <b>to establish</b> that only <b>a priest</b> may pinch its nape, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that even a non-priest may perform this procedure. <b>Could this not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference: And if</b> with regard to <b>a sheep</b> burnt offering, with regard to <b>which</b> the verse <b>established</b> that <b>it</b> must be slaughtered in the <b>north</b> (see Leviticus 1:11), it did <b>not establish</b> that <b>it</b> must be slaughtered by a <b>priest</b> (see 32a), then in the case of <b>a bird</b> burnt offering, with regard to <b>which</b> the verse <b>did not establish</b> that its nape must be pinched in the <b>north, is it not logical that</b> the verse does <b>not establish</b> that its nape must be pinched by <b>a priest?</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> that <b>“the priest</b> shall bring it to the altar,” in order <b>to establish</b> that its nape must be pinched specifically by <b>a priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:15 | shall bring it | Zevachim 66a:2 | The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to a pit, <b>since it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), it is evident that <b>it is incumbent upon him to cover</b> the pit. <b>But here, since it is written</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15), the term “it” indicates that the verse is referring only to a burnt offering, and <b>the verse has</b> thereby <b>differentiated between a bird sin offering and a bird burnt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:16 | “And he shall take away its crop with its feathers, | Meilah 12a:2 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> in response: It is derived from the fact <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to a bird sacrificed as a burnt offering: <b>“And he shall take away its crop with its feathers,</b> and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes” (Leviticus 1:16), referring to the location for the placement of the removed ashes. <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not needed for</b> the <b>matter of the external altar,</b> as that <i>halakha</i> is already derived from the phrase: “And he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3), <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> the ashes of <b>the inner altar,</b> teaching that these ashes must also be placed there. |
| Leviticus 1:16 | “And he shall take away murato with its feathers” | Zevachim 65a:19 | § The mishna teaches that after the priest throws the bird’s head onto the fire on the altar, <b>he arrives at the body</b> and removes the crop and the feathers attached to it and the innards that emerge with them, and tosses them to the place of the ashes. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse pertaining to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And he shall take away <i>murato</i> with its feathers”</b> (Leviticus 1:16). <b>This</b> word, <i>murato</i>, is referring to the <b>crop.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:17 | and with regard to a bird burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing | Menachot 110a:14 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a bird burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:2). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:17 | “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing | Menachot 110a:18 | <b>And it is stated with regard to a large bull</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a small bird</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:17 | by its wings | Shabbat 108a:3 | <b>Rabbi Zeira raised an objection</b> to the conclusion that the skin of a bird is considered skin. Didn’t we learn in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “And he shall rend it <b>by its wings</b> without creating a division, and the priest shall burn it upon the altar on the wood that is on the fire” (Leviticus 1:17), teaches that the priest <b>must prepare</b> even <b>the skin</b> to make it acceptable for the altar? That is not the case when animals are offered, as their skin is flayed before they are sacrificed. <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> that the skin of a bird <b>is skin, how does the verse include it</b> among that which the priest prepares for the altar? <b>Abaye said:</b> This is not difficult. Indeed, <b>it is skin, and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Torah includes it</b> as a biblical decree, specifying that the skin of a bird is sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 1:17 | with regard to a bird burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma” | Shevuot 15a:8 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>Is</b> the size of the offering <b>of</b> any <b>importance before Heaven? But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 110a): <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a bird burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:17), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a meal-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The same term is used in all three cases even though the three offerings are of different value. This <b>teaches that one who brings a substantial</b> sacrifice <b>and one who brings a modest</b> sacrifice have equal merit, and both offerings are accepted as having a pleasing aroma, <b>provided that one directs his heart to his Father in Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:17 | shall make it smoke | Zevachim 65a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that the burning of the head</b> is <b>by itself and the body</b> is burned <b>by itself? As it is stated:</b> “And he shall rend it by its wings…<b>and</b> the priest <b>shall make it smoke</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:17). Since <b>the burning of the body is stated</b> in this verse, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the earlier phrase: <b>“And make it smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:15)? One must conclude that <b>the verse is speaking about the burning of the head.</b> |
| Leviticus 1:17 | “And he shall rend” | Zevachim 65b:1 | § The mishna teaches that after removing the crop and the feathers and innards that emerged with it, the priest <b>ripped</b> the bird lengthwise <b>and did not separate</b> the two halves of the bird. In this regard <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall rend”</b> (Leviticus 1:17). The act of <b>rending is</b> performed <b>only by hand, and so too,</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to Samson: <b>“And he rent it as one would have rent a kid,</b> and he had nothing in his hand” (Judges 14:6). |
| Leviticus 1:17 | a burnt offering” | Zevachim 66a:4 | § The mishna teaches that if the priest squeezed out the blood of the head and did not squeeze out the blood of the body, it is disqualified. If he <b>squeezed out</b> the <b>blood of the body</b> and did not squeeze out the blood of the head, the offering is valid. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In reference to a bird burnt offering, the verse states, seemingly unnecessarily: “It is <b>a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 1:17). This teaches <b>that even though</b> the priest <b>squeezed out the blood of the body and did not squeeze out the blood of the head,</b> it is valid. One <b>might</b> have thought that if the priest <b>squeezed out the blood of the head and did not squeeze out the blood of the body</b> the offering is still valid. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It is.”</b> |
| Leviticus 2:1 | fine flour, | Menachot 103a:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering from barley, should bring</b> the meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> as voluntary meal offerings are brought exclusively from wheat. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering from <b>flour, should bring</b> the meal offering from <b>fine flour,</b> as it is written: “His offering shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:1). If one vows to bring a meal offering <b>without oil and without frankincense, he should bring</b> it with <b>oil and frankincense,</b> as voluntary meal offerings require oil and frankincense. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | brings | Menachot 104b:7 | § The mishna stated that <b>two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a tenth of an ephah together. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when an individual <b>brings</b> a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), in the singular, that is not a proof, as with regard to <b>a burnt offering as well, it is written</b> in the singular: “When any man of you <b>brings</b> an offering” (Leviticus 1:2). Nevertheless, two people may bring a burnt offering together, as stated in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | an individual | Menachot 104b:8 | <b>Rather, what is the reason</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> is brought by two people? The reason is <b>that it is written</b> in second person plural: “These you shall offer…beside <b>your burnt offerings [<i>le’oloteikhem</i>],</b> or your meal offerings, or your drink offerings, or your peace offerings” (Numbers 29:39). The Gemara points out: With regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> it is <b>also written</b> in the plural: <b>“Your meal offerings [<i>leminḥoteikhem</i>].” Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring a meal offering as a partnership is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), indicating that only one individual may offer it, but not two together. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | ” | Menachot 106b:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to one who pledges to donate wood, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when one brings a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]<b>”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). The superfluous word “<b><i>korban</i></b>” <b>teaches that one can voluntarily give wood</b> as an offering for the altar. <b>And how much</b> wood must one bring if he does not specify an amount? <b>Two logs. And</b> the support for the fact that wood can be brought as a voluntary offering is <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: “And we cast lots for the wood offering”</b> (Nehemiah 10:35). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This voluntary donation of <b>wood is an offering</b> like a meal offering, <b>and</b> therefore it <b>requires salt and requires bringing</b> to the corner of the altar, like a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | [ korban minḥa ]” | Menachot 107a:18 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: And how can you say that</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the source of the gift offering of oil is not from the meal offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when one brings a meal offering <b>[<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), that the superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one may contribute oil. And how much</b> must one contribute? <b>Three <i>log</i>.</b> The Gemara explains the question: <b>Who did you hear that says</b> the gift offering of oil is <b>three <i>log</i>? This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> yet he <b>cites</b> the source of the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> the word <b><i>korban</i>,</b> which is referring to a meal offering. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: If</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | a meal offering [ korban minḥa ]” | Menachot 20b:3 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when one brings <b>a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). The superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one can voluntarily give wood</b> as an offering for the altar. <b>And how much</b> wood must one bring if he does not specify an amount? <b>Two logs. And</b> the support for the fact that wood can be brought as a voluntary offering is from a verse, <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: “And we cast lots for the wood offering”</b> (Nehemiah 10:35). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This voluntary donation of <b>wood is</b> an offering like <b>a meal offering, and</b> therefore it <b>requires salt and requires bringing</b> to the corner of the altar, like a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | oil | Menachot 51a:5 | <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way: It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated with regard to</b> the <b>voluntary meal offering:</b> “And when anyone brings a meal offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour <b>oil</b> upon it” (Leviticus 2:1). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering, one brings <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour (see 88a); <b>so too here,</b> one brings <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | anyone | Menachot 59a:18 | The Gemara answers: Even so, <b>it stands to reason</b> that one should include the meal offering of priests, as in the same passage that deals with the <i>omer</i> meal offering the verse states: “And when <b>anyone</b> brings a meal offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:1). This verse includes all meal offerings of individuals in the <i>halakhot</i> of meal offerings stated in this chapter, including the meal offering of priests. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | oil and frankincense: The fine-flour meal offering, | Menachot 59a:2 | The mishna elaborates: <b>And these</b> are the meal offerings that <b>require</b> both <b>oil and frankincense: The fine-flour meal offering,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon” (Leviticus 2:1); <b>the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a pan</b> (see Leviticus 2:5–6); <b>the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan</b> (see Leviticus 2:7–10); <b>and the</b> meal offering baked in an oven, which can be brought in the form of <b>loaves or</b> in the form of <b>wafers</b> (see Leviticus 2:4). |
| Leviticus 2:1 | “Anyone” | Menachot 59a:24 | Finally, both are brought even <b>on Shabbat,</b> whereas the meal offering of priests may not be brought on Shabbat. Accordingly, as there are also four points of similarity between the meal offering brought with libations and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, one can ask why the meal offering brought with libations is not included in the requirement of frankincense. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that one should include the meal offering of priests in the requirement of frankincense, as the verse states: <b>“Anyone”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), which is referring to all meal offerings of individuals. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | one | Menachot 5a:6 | <b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, raises an objection</b> to Rav Adda bar Ahava’s explanation from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to birds that</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to meal offerings,</b> and <b>there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to meal offerings that</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to birds.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>There is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to birds</b> that does not apply to meal offerings, <b>as birds</b> may be <b>brought as a gift</b> offering on behalf <b>of two</b> people, i.e., two people may take a vow to bring a single bird offering jointly. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>meal offerings</b> it <b>is written:</b> “And when <b>one</b> brings a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), indicating that only individuals may vow to bring a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | valid, as it is written: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it” | Menachot 9a:4 | § <b>It was stated:</b> If one <b>mixed</b> the oil of a meal offering into <b>it outside the wall of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>disqualified,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it is <b>valid. Reish Lakish says:</b> It is <b>valid, as it is written: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), <b>and then</b> it is written: <b>“And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall remove”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). |
| Leviticus 2:1 | and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon” | Sotah 14b:9 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The owner of the meal-offering <b>puts its oil and frankincense on it.</b> The Gemara cites the source of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is stated:</b> “And when anyone brings a meal-offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; <b>and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). |
| Leviticus 2:1 | one | Zevachim 5b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the offering is <b>acquired by</b> the heirs, and this is why it atones for their transgressions? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that if one <b>left his two sons a meal offering and</b> then <b>died,</b> the offering must be <b>sacrificed, and it does not have</b> the status of a meal offering brought in <b>partnership? And if it enters your mind</b> that the offering is <b>acquired by</b> the heirs, it should be considered a meal offering brought in partnership, which is unfit, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And when <b>one</b> brings a meal offering unto the Lord” (Leviticus 2:1). The word “one” teaches that two people cannot bring a meal offering together. Clearly, the heirs do not inherit the offering, and if so, it should not atone for their transgressions. |
| Leviticus 2:1 | a meal offering [ korban minḥa ]” | Zevachim 91b:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says: According to the statement of Rabbi Tarfon</b> that oil may be sacrificed as a gift offering, in the case of <b>one who contributes oil,</b> a priest <b>removes a handful of</b> the oil and sacrifices it on the altar, <b>and its remainder is eaten</b> by the priests. <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling of Shmuel? The <b>verse states:</b> “And when one brings <b>a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). The superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one may contribute oil, and</b> its status is <b>like</b> that of <b>a meal offering: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering</b> the priest <b>removes a handful and its remainder is eaten, so too</b> with regard to <b>oil,</b> the priest <b>removes a handful and its remainder is eaten.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:1 | a meal offering [ korban minḥa ]” | Zevachim 91b:11 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: How can you say that,</b> i.e., that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the source of the gift offering of oil is not from the meal offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when one brings <b>a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), that the superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one may contribute oil?</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And how much</b> must one contribute? <b>Three <i>log</i>.</b> The Gemara explains the question: <b>And whom did you hear who says</b> the gift offering of oil is <b>three <i>log</i>? This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> yet he <b>cites</b> the source of the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> the word <b><i>korban</i>,</b> which is referring to a meal offering. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: If</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught;</b> and I cannot take issue with it. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | and he shall remove a handful” | Kiddushin 36a:19 | With regard to <b>the removal of a handful,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron,</b> the priests, <b>and he shall remove a handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). This teaches that <b>the sons of Aaron</b> take a handful, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | of its fine flour, and of its oil, together with all its frankincense; | Meilah 9a:1 | <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall remove his handful <b>of its fine flour, and of its oil, together with all its frankincense;</b> and the priest shall make its memorial part smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:2)? This verse <b>excludes</b> those situations <b>where</b> some of <b>its flour was missing, or</b> some of <b>its oil was missing, or</b> some of <b>its frankincense was missing,</b> in which case the priest may not place the meal offering on the fire. This indicates that one must ensure that some of the flour, oil, and frankincense remain. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing | Menachot 110a:14 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a bird burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:2). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | his handful” | Menachot 11a:9 | The Gemara notes <b>that</b> this <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. From the verse that states: “And he shall remove from there <b>his handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), one <b>might</b> have thought that the handful should be <b>overflowing.</b> Therefore, another <b>verse states:</b> “And he shall take up from it <b>with his handful [<i>bekumtzo</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). The prefix that means “with” can also mean: In, indicating that the proper measure of a handful is that which is contained within one’s fingers alone. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | “his handful” | Menachot 19b:3 | <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel must agree that <b>wherever the verse repeats</b> a rite it is <b>certainly</b> understood to be <b>indispensable; and here,</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the expressions <b>“his handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2) and <b>“with his hand”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And he shall remove <b>his handful,”</b> and elsewhere it states: “And he shall take up from it <b>with his hand.”</b> The change in terminology between the two verses teaches <b>that</b> the priest <b>should not</b> use a utensil to <b>measure an amount for the handful</b> of a meal offering, but should use his hand. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | a furnace does not release smoke until the fire takes hold of the majority of | Menachot 26b:11 | <b>Rav Yehuda said to Rabba bar Rav Yitzḥak: I will explain to you the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The verse states: “And behold, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace”</b> (Genesis 19:28), and <b>a furnace does not release smoke until the fire takes hold of the majority of</b> the fuel. Rabbi Yoḥanan derived from this verse that the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire, since the priests are instructed to make the handful smoke, as it is written: “And the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2). |
| Leviticus 2:2 | as well as all of its frankincense” | Menachot 27a:10 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> failure to burn <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the repetition of the mention of the two together in the verse, as it is written: “The priest shall remove of it a handful of its fine flour and of its oil, <b>as well as all of its frankincense”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and again with regard to the meal offering of a sinner it is stated: <b>“And all the frankincense which is upon the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). |
| Leviticus 2:2 | the verse states “his handful” twice, | Menachot 27a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the failure to sacrifice the minority of the handful disqualifies the entire offering? This is derived from the fact that <b>the verse states “his handful” twice,</b> once with regard to the voluntary meal offering (Leviticus 2:2) and once with regard to the meal offering of a sinner (Leviticus 5:12), and any <i>halakha</i> repeated in the verses is deemed indispensable. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | of its fine flour” | Menachot 27a:6 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour brought as a meal offering, failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from qualifying as a proper meal offering. <b>What is the reason? The verse states:</b> “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The usage of the term “of its fine flour” instead of: Of the fine flour, teaches <b>that if any amount</b> of its flour <b>was missing,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | a voluntary meal offering, the verse states: “And of its oil” | Menachot 27a:8 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the</b> <i>log</i> of <b>oil</b> that is required for the meal offering, failure to add <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from being a sufficient measure of oil. In the case of the oil <b>of the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is learned from the term: <b>“So”</b> (Numbers 15:11), stated with regard to the libations. <b>And</b> in the case of the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies <b>a voluntary meal offering, the verse states: “And of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), demonstrating <b>that if any amount</b> of its oil was <b>missing,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | of its fine flour and of its oil” | Menachot 27a:9 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the fine flour and the oil,</b> failure to bring <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the fact that the two are juxtaposed in the verse: “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and the fact that this requirement is repeated in the verse: <b>“Of its groats, and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:16), teaches that each is indispensable. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | and he shall remove from there | Menachot 6b:17 | The Gemara continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; <b>and he shall remove from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), that this verse indicates that the removal of a handful from a meal offering may be performed <b>from the place where the feet of the non-priest stand,</b> i.e., anywhere within the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | and he shall remove from there | Menachot 8b:10 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; <b>and he shall remove from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2). The verse indicates that the removal of a handful from a meal offering may be performed <b>from the place where the feet of the non-priest</b> may <b>stand,</b> i.e., anywhere within the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | “And he shall remove | Menachot 8b:16 | <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>was necessary</b> in order to permit the removal of a handful anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and it states: <b>“And he shall remove</b> from there his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), one could claim: <b>Just as</b> the <b>bringing</b> of the meal offering is <b>in the southwestern corner</b> of the altar, <b>so too,</b> the <b>removal of the handful</b> must <b>also</b> be performed <b>in the southwestern corner.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the removal of the handful may be performed anywhere in the Temple courtyard, but this does not serve to exclude the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall remove” | Menachot 9a:4 | § <b>It was stated:</b> If one <b>mixed</b> the oil of a meal offering into <b>it outside the wall of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>disqualified,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it is <b>valid. Reish Lakish says:</b> It is <b>valid, as it is written: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), <b>and then</b> it is written: <b>“And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall remove”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). |
| Leviticus 2:2 | of its fine flour” | Menachot 9b:10 | The Gemara further discusses the disagreement between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Malkiyu says</b> that <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught:</b> The verse states: “And he shall remove…<b>of its fine flour”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). This indicates <b>that if</b> the meal offering <b>lacks any amount</b> of its flour, it is <b>disqualified</b> and the priest may not remove a handful from it. Similarly, the term: <b>“Of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), teaches <b>that if</b> the meal offering <b>lacks any amount</b> of its oil, it is <b>disqualified.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | with regard to a meal-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma” | Shevuot 15a:8 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>Is</b> the size of the offering <b>of</b> any <b>importance before Heaven? But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 110a): <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a bird burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:17), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a meal-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The same term is used in all three cases even though the three offerings are of different value. This <b>teaches that one who brings a substantial</b> sacrifice <b>and one who brings a modest</b> sacrifice have equal merit, and both offerings are accepted as having a pleasing aroma, <b>provided that one directs his heart to his Father in Heaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | As it is written: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, | Sotah 14b:10 | The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And he carries it to the priest.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons,</b> the priests” (Leviticus 2:2). |
| Leviticus 2:2 | of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof” | Sotah 14b:19 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he removes a handful from the place where its oil has accumulated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take from there his handful <b>of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The Torah also states: “And the priest shall make the memorial part of it smoke, even <b>of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:16). The handful should be taken from the area where there is an abundance of oil. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | and the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke | Sotah 15a:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: After <b>the handful is sacrificed, the remainders of</b> the meal-offering <b>are eaten.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests…<b>and the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2). The memorial part is the handful. <b>And it is written</b> afterward: <b>“But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Leviticus 2:3). |
| Leviticus 2:2 | The Sages taught: “His handfuls” | Yoma 47a:19 | § <b>The Sages taught: “His handfuls”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). I <b>might</b> have thought it should <b>be overflowing</b> from the handful, and therefore <b>the verse states: “His handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), which indicates a precise amount. <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is based solely on the phrase <b>“his handful,”</b> I <b>might</b> have thought the priest may pinch a small amount <b>even with</b> just <b>his fingertips,</b> not with his entire finger. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His handfuls”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), meaning <b>as people</b> usually <b>take a handful,</b> i.e., with their whole hand. <b>How</b> should he perform this service? <b>He scoops</b> by closing <b>his three fingers over the palm of his hand, and takes a handful</b> from the flour of the meal-offering. |
| Leviticus 2:2 | burning is stated with regard to the remainder | Zevachim 110a:19 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> A term of <b>burning is stated with regard to the handful</b> removed from the meal offering, <b>and</b> a term of <b>burning is stated with regard to the remainder</b> of the meal offering. With regard to the handful, referred to by the Torah as “the memorial part,” it is written: “And the priest shall burn the memorial part upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2), and with regard to the remainder of the meal offering it is written: “Do not burn it as a fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This provides a verbal analogy that teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to the <b>burning of</b> the <b>handful,</b> if two handfuls are mixed together one <b>handful does not nullify another, so too,</b> with regard to the <b>burning of</b> the <b>remainder,</b> if the remainder and the handful are mixed together, the <b>remainder does not nullify</b> the <b>handful.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:2 | and he shall take from there | Zevachim 63a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the meal offerings: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests; <b>and he shall take from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2). The term “from there” indicates that the handful must be taken <b>from a place where the feet of the non-priest</b> who brought the meal offering may <b>stand,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard, but not the Sanctuary, in direct contradiction to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. |
| Leviticus 2:3 | that it is written with regard to a meal offering: “But that which is left | Meilah 8b:11 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> consider the fact <b>that it is written with regard to a meal offering: “But that which is left</b> of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire” (Leviticus 2:3). Does this <b>also</b> mean <b>that if</b> some of the meal offering <b>remains</b> then it is given to the priests, but there is no need to ensure that some of it remains <i>ab initio</i>? <b>And if you would say</b> this is <b>indeed</b> the case, |
| Leviticus 2:3 | there it is written: “But that which is left | Meilah 9a:2 | The Sages <b>said</b> in response to the difficulty of Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: In general, the terms “remainder” or “leftover” refer to a situation where there happened to be some of the item remaining. Yet, the case of the meal offering is unique, as <b>there it is written: “But that which is left</b> of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire” (Leviticus 2:3). This part of <b>the verse</b> is <b>superfluous,</b> as it appears in Leviticus 2:10 as well. It is therefore derived from the repetition of this phrase that in the specific case of a meal offering one must ensure that some of the items remain. This requirement does not apply to a bird sin offering. |
| Leviticus 2:3 | “But that which is left of the meal offering | Menachot 9b:11 | <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the verse that states: <b>“But that which is left of the meal offering</b> shall be Aaron’s and his sons’” (Leviticus 2:3), teaches that the remainder of the meal offering is given to the priests only if there was initially a whole meal offering, <b>to the exclusion of a meal offering that was lacking, or whose handful was lacking, or from which</b> the priest <b>did not burn any frankincense.</b> In such cases, the meal offering is disqualified and its remainder may not be consumed by the priests. |
| Leviticus 2:3 | “But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be for Aaron and his sons” | Sotah 15a:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: After <b>the handful is sacrificed, the remainders of</b> the meal-offering <b>are eaten.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests…<b>and the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2). The memorial part is the handful. <b>And it is written</b> afterward: <b>“But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Leviticus 2:3). |
| Leviticus 2:3 | “But the rest of the meal-offering | Yoma 61a:16 | The Gemara analyzes this issue: <b>The Master said</b> above that everyone agrees that the <b>presentations of</b> oil placed on <b>the head</b> of the leper <b>are not indispensable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “And the rest of the oil</b> that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified, to make atonement for him before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:29), which indicates that this presentation involves only the rest of the oil and is therefore not an essential element of atonement, <b>however, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> consider the verse: <b>“But the rest of the meal-offering</b> shall be for Aharon and his sons; it is one of the sacred offerings of the Lord by fire” (Leviticus 2:3). Should we say, <b>so too, that they are not indispensable?</b> This cannot be the case, as the <i>halakha</i> is that if the remnants of the meal-offering are lost before the handful is burnt, the owner of the offering must bring another handful. |
| Leviticus 2:4 | baked in an oven” | Menachot 63a:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: “And when you bring a meal offering <b>baked in an oven”</b> (Leviticus 2:4), this emphasizes that it must be prepared in an oven, <b>and not baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>, nor baked</b> on roofing <b>tiles, nor baked</b> in the baking <b>pits</b> of <b>the Arabs,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 2:4 | The Sages taught | Menachot 63a:15 | § The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, he may not bring half</b> the required offering in the form of loaves and half in the form of wafers, whereas Rabbi Shimon deems this permitted, as it is one offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in an oven” (Leviticus 2:4). The phrase: <b>“And when you bring,”</b> indicates that this offering is not obligatory. Rather, <b>when you</b> wish you may <b>bring,</b> i.e., the verse teaches how <b>to perform</b> the meal offering baked in an oven as <b>a voluntary matter.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:4 | say “offering” only one | Menachot 63b:1 | <b>And is it stated</b> with regard to a meal offering baked in an oven: <b>“Offering,”</b> and again: <b>Offering,</b> for a total of <b>two times,</b> once in connection to a meal offering of loaves and once in connection to a meal offering of wafers? If that were the case, it would indicate that these are two types of offerings. But <b>doesn’t it</b> actually <b>say “offering” only one</b> time: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4)? <b>And it is stated with regard to this</b> meal offering both <b>loaves and wafers,</b> which indicates that these are two varieties of the same offering. |
| Leviticus 2:4 | “With oil,” | Menachot 63b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings baked in an oven, respond to Rabbi Shimon’s proof? After all, <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well</b> when he points out that the verse mentions “offering” only once. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda could have <b>said to you: Since it is written: “With oil,”</b> and: <b>“With oil,”</b> in the verse: “It shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4), it is considered <b>as though it is written “offering”</b> and <b>“offering,”</b> and therefore these are deemed two different types of meal offering. |
| Leviticus 2:4 | mixed | Menachot 75a:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, the verse states: “It shall be of <b>fine flour</b> unleavened, <b>mixed</b> with oil.” This <b>teaches that it is mixed</b> while still <b>flour. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that he <b>mixes them, as it is stated:</b> “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). The Rabbis <b>said to him: But is it not with regard to loaves of a thanks offering</b> that <b>it is stated:</b> “Unleavened <b>loaves</b> mixed with oil…and loaves mixed with oil, of fine flour soaked” (Leviticus 7:12), <b>and it is not possible to mix them when they are loaves,</b> but <b>only</b> when they are <b>fine flour?</b> |
| Leviticus 2:4 | mixed | Menachot 75a:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The loaves</b> of the meal offering baked in an oven <b>require mixing</b> of their flour with oil, <b>and wafers</b> require only <b>smearing. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse specifies with regard to the oven-baked meal offering: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). This indicates that only the loaves are mixed, <b>but the wafers are not mixed.</b> This derivation is necessary, as one <b>might</b> have thought: Could the opposite conclusion <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference? And if loaves, which do not require smearing,</b> do <b>require mixing,</b> then <b>is it not logical</b> that <b>wafers, which require smearing,</b> also <b>require mixing?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “Loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed,” but wafers are not mixed.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:4 | What is the reason? | Menachot 76b:2 | § <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to an oven-<b>baked meal offering that</b> one <b>baked</b> as only <b>one loaf,</b> although he did not bring the mandated quantity, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that the verse states with regard to the oven-baked meal offering: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:4). The term <b>“unleavened loaves [<i>matzot</i>]” is written</b> without the letter <i>vav</i>, which is generally used with regard to the plural form. Therefore, it may be read in the singular as <b>unleavened loaf [<i>matzat</i>],</b> which teaches that even one unleavened loaf is fit. |
| Leviticus 2:4 | baked in an oven, | Zevachim 50a:14 | <b>Ravina said to</b> Rami bar Ḥama: <b>From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>learns</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“unleavened”</b> and <b>“unleavened” from loaves</b> of the thanks offering? <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>learns</b> the verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word “unleavened” stated with regard to meal offerings <b>baked in an oven,</b> about which the verse states explicitly that they are prepared with fine flour: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). If so, there is no source that a <i>halakha</i> derived via a verbal analogy can teach a <i>halakha</i> via a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 2:5 | itself: “It shall be [ tehiye ] of matza ” | Menachot 53a:11 | Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: The <i>halakha</i> of meal offerings is not derived from Passover, as <b>it is written in</b> the context of a meal offering <b>itself: “It shall be [<i>tehiye</i>] of <i>matza</i>”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), which can be read as meaning: <b>Preserve [<i>haḥaye</i>]</b> <i>matza</i>, i.e., preserve the <i>matza</i> as it is, and do not let it become leavened. |
| Leviticus 2:5 | matza ” | Menachot 53a:9 | All these objections indicate that the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” can be interpreted in ways other than that suggested by Rabbi Ami. Accordingly, the Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that all meal offerings not brought as <i>matza</i> are not valid? The Gemara answers: We derive it <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> discussing a verse concerning meal offerings: “It shall be of <b><i>matza</i>”</b> (Leviticus 2:5): One <b>might</b> have thought that it is only <b>a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> for a meal offering to be of <i>matza</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be,”</b> which indicates that <b>the verse established it</b> as <b>an obligation,</b> i.e., if the meal offering was not brought as <i>matza</i> it is not valid. |
| Leviticus 2:5 | “your offering” | Menachot 74b:13 | With regard to the three placements of oil in a pan meal offering and a deep-pan meal offering, <b>the Sages taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“And if your offering is a deep-pan meal offering, it shall be made of fine flour in oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:7). This <b>teaches that it requires</b> the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>vessel,</b> and the flour is added afterward. In addition, the term <b>“your offering”</b> in this verse and the term <b>“your offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), written with regard to the meal offering prepared in a pan, are understood <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy:</b> |
| Leviticus 2:6 | a meal offering” | Menachot 75a:16 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse discussing a meal offering prepared in a pan states: <b>“You shall break it in pieces,</b> and pour oil upon it; it is <b>a meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:6). The fact that the verse concludes with the phrase: “It is a meal offering,” indicates that the Torah means <b>to include all the meal offerings</b> in the requirement <b>of breaking</b> into pieces. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the two loaves and the shewbread.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall break <b>it</b> in pieces”; i.e., the meal offering baked in a pan, but not the two loaves and the shewbread. |
| Leviticus 2:6 | “You shall break | Menachot 75b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the difference between the meal offering of an Israelite and that of a priest detailed in the mishna, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall break</b> it in pieces” (Leviticus 2:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that it should be broken <b>into</b> only <b>two</b> pieces. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Break it in <b>pieces,”</b> indicating that each of these two pieces is subsequently broken into more pieces. <b>If</b> the Torah requires <b>pieces,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should</b> repeatedly break it into pieces until he <b>renders it</b> into <b>crumbs.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Break <b>it,”</b> i.e., break <b>it in pieces, and</b> do <b>not</b> break <b>its pieces into</b> additional <b>pieces.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:7 | “And if your offering is a deep-pan meal offering, it shall be made of fine flour in oil” | Menachot 74b:13 | With regard to the three placements of oil in a pan meal offering and a deep-pan meal offering, <b>the Sages taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“And if your offering is a deep-pan meal offering, it shall be made of fine flour in oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:7). This <b>teaches that it requires</b> the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>vessel,</b> and the flour is added afterward. In addition, the term <b>“your offering”</b> in this verse and the term <b>“your offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), written with regard to the meal offering prepared in a pan, are understood <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy:</b> |
| Leviticus 2:8 | the verse, | Menachot 19b:8 | The Gemara returns to discussing Rav’s statement that a rite is deemed indispensable if it is repeated in the verses. <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: But</b> what of <b>bringing</b> the meal offering to the corner of the altar, <b>which</b> is <b>repeated</b> in <b>the verse,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall bring it to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8); <b>and</b> it is <b>not indispensable,</b> as stated in the mishna (18a)? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Where is it repeated? As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord,</b> in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). |
| Leviticus 2:8 | As the Sages taught | Menachot 60a:11 | § The mishna teaches that the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon disagree about whether the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest require the ritual of bringing near. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A verse discussing the meal offering prepared in the pan states: “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of these to the Lord, and it shall be drawn near to the priest, and he shall bring it near to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8). <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>And you shall bring that which is made of these to the Lord and it shall be drawn near to the priest and he shall bring it near</b> to the altar, omitting the words: The meal offering, <b>I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> the <b>handful</b> that is sacrificed on the altar <b>alone requires bringing near.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:8 | these | Menachot 60b:18 | <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> necessary because the opposite conclusion could otherwise have been derived by <b>logical inference</b> based on juxtaposition: The <b>community brings an obligatory meal offering from wheat,</b> i.e., the two loaves brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> the community also <b>brings an obligatory meal offering from barley,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering. <b>So too an individual, who brings a meal offering from wheat</b> as a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering, <b>can</b> likewise <b>bring a meal offering from barley</b> as a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering. Therefore, to prevent this inference, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of <b>these</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:8), which teaches: I have <b>nothing other than these</b> five meal offerings as individual meal offerings. |
| Leviticus 2:8 | “The meal offering” | Menachot 60b:20 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“The meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), this serves <b>to include</b> the <b>other meal offerings, for example the meal offering of gentiles</b> and <b>a meal offering</b> brought <b>by women, with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include</b> from this verse <b>even the two loaves and the shewbread.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of these,”</b> which indicates that not all meal offerings are included in the requirement of bringing near. |
| Leviticus 2:8 | and it shall be drawn near | Menachot 60b:22 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations,</b> which is <b>entirely</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire,</b> by this logic one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it</b> should <b>require bringing near.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of these to the Lord, <b>and it shall be drawn near</b> to the priest, and he shall bring it near to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8). This indicates that the requirement of bringing near applies only to those meal offerings listed in this chapter, not to the meal offering brought with libations, which is not mentioned. |
| Leviticus 2:8 | the verse states: “The meal offering” | Menachot 60b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the <b>common element</b> of the voluntary meal offering and the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>? It is notable <b>in that they are suited to come</b> as the meal offering <b>of a wealthy person</b> just <b>as</b> they are suited to come as the meal offering <b>of a poor person.</b> Shall <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the meal offering of a sinner, which is not suitable to come</b> either as the meal offering <b>of a wealthy person</b> or as the meal offering <b>of a poor person,</b> since a sinner who is not poor does not bring a meal offering but a different offering (see Leviticus 5:6–11)? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), with the addition of the definite article, to include the meal offering of a sinner in the requirement of bringing near. |
| Leviticus 2:8 | the verse states: “And he shall bring it near | Menachot 61a:2 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall bring it near</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8), to exclude the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest from the requirement of bringing near. The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: <b>But that</b> verse <b>is required for its own sake,</b> i.e., to teach the basic <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a meal offering <b>requires bringing near</b> to the altar. The <i>baraita</i> answers: This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have stated just: <b>“And he shall bring,”</b> and instead it states: <b>“And he shall bring it.”</b> |
| Leviticus 2:8 | since it is written: “And it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar” | Menachot 8b:16 | <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>was necessary</b> in order to permit the removal of a handful anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and it states: <b>“And he shall remove</b> from there his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), one could claim: <b>Just as</b> the <b>bringing</b> of the meal offering is <b>in the southwestern corner</b> of the altar, <b>so too,</b> the <b>removal of the handful</b> must <b>also</b> be performed <b>in the southwestern corner.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the removal of the handful may be performed anywhere in the Temple courtyard, but this does not serve to exclude the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 2:8 | and he shall bring it unto the altar” | Sotah 14b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And the priest</b> then <b>carries it to the altar.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written:</b> “And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; and it shall be presented unto the priest, <b>and he shall bring it unto the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8). |
| Leviticus 2:8 | and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar” | Sotah 14b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that this is <b>indeed</b> so? The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; <b>and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8); <b>just as presentation to the priest is in a vessel, so too bringing</b> it <b>to the altar</b> must be <b>in a vessel.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:8 | as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar” | Zevachim 119b:15 | The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>waving</b> of those offerings that require waving is <b>as it is written: “And the priest</b> shall take one of the lambs, and offer it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and <b>wave</b> them for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 14:12). The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>bringing</b> meal offerings to the corner of the altar before the removal of the handful is <b>as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8). The definite article before the word “altar” indicates that this applies only to the altar in the Tabernacle, and not on a private altar. |
| Leviticus 2:8 | since it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar” | Zevachim 63a:12 | The Gemara presents a different answer: <b>Rather, it was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that the handful may be taken from the meal offering anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and then it states: <b>“And he shall take up from there his handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), indicating that the handful must be taken from the vessel in which the meal offering was brought near the altar, that the verses also indicate that the handful must be taken in the place where the vessel is brought near the altar. |
| Leviticus 2:9 | as the verse states: “And the priest shall remove from the meal offering its memorial part, and shall make it smoke upon the altar” | Menachot 9b:3 | Rabbi Yoḥanan cited this <i>baraita</i> as proof that even according to Rabbi Yehoshua, if a portion of the remainder of a meal offering remains intact then the handful may be burned on account of it. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>the one who disqualifies</b> the handful when the remainder is lacking, i.e., Reish Lakish, how does he explain the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua? The Gemara responds: Reish Lakish would claim that it <b>is different here,</b> in the case of a meal offering, <b>as the verse states: “And the priest shall remove from the meal offering its memorial part, and shall make it smoke upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:9). Since it is clear that the verse is discussing a meal offering, the apparently superfluous mention of <b>“the meal offering”</b> teaches that <b>unless the entire meal offering is</b> intact, the priest <b>shall not burn</b> the handful. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | shall be made | Bekhorot 33b:15 | <b>And furthermore,</b> one cannot draw parallels between the opinions of the two sources, as <b>here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of certain <b>verses, and there they disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of certain other <b>verses. As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> of the Sages who disagree as to whether one may let the blood of the firstborn animal <b>concede that one who leavens</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> another had already <b>leavened</b> it is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the additional leavening, <b>as it is written: “It shall not be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and</b> it is also stated: “No meal offering that you sacrifice to God <b>shall be made</b> with leaven” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | disqualified it, | Keritot 6a:16 | <b>And if one placed honey in</b> the incense he has <b>disqualified it,</b> as it is stated: “For you shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). If he <b>omitted any one of its spices</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: The balm</b> mentioned here <b>is nothing other than a resin</b> exuded <b>from the balsam tree,</b> not the bark of the tree itself. The <b>Kersannah lye</b> mentioned is not part of the ingredients of the incense itself, but it is necessary <b>as one rubs the onycha in it so that</b> the onycha <b>should be pleasant.</b> Likewise, the <b>Cyprus wine</b> is required <b>as one soaks the onycha in it so that it should be strong. And urine is good for</b> this purpose, <b>but one does not bring urine into the Temple</b> because it is inappropriate. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | its remainder becomes leaven, one violates a prohibition, as it is stated: “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven; | Menachot 55a:10 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal-offerings</b> that come as <i>matza</i> <b>are</b> to be <b>kneaded with lukewarm</b> water so that the dough will bake well, as only a small amount of oil is added. <b>And one must watch over them</b> to ensure <b>that they do not</b> become <b>leaven</b> while kneading and shaping them, <b>and if</b> a meal offering or even only <b>its remainder becomes leaven, one violates a prohibition, as it is stated: “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven;</b> as you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). <b>And one is liable</b> to be flogged <b>for kneading</b> the meal offering, <b>and for shaping</b> it, <b>and for baking</b> it, if the meal offering becomes leaven. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | shall be made with leaven; | Menachot 55b:1 | <b>be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Isn’t</b> this requirement <b>already stated</b> earlier: <b>“No</b> meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord <b>shall be made with leaven;</b> as you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11)? Rather, the phrase “it shall not be baked with leaven” serves to teach a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>Since</b> the prohibition concerning leaven <b>is</b> first <b>stated</b> in general terms: <b>Shall not be made with leaven,</b> without specification, one <b>might</b> have thought that one who causes a meal offering to become leaven <b>will be liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes <b>for all of</b> his actions, i.e., kneading, shaping, and baking the dough. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall not be baked</b> with leaven,” which teaches that one who causes a meal offering to become leaven is liable separately for baking it, and for each stage of its preparation. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | distanced from one another, | Menachot 55b:9 | <b>Rabbi Aptoriki said:</b> That hermeneutic principle is not relevant here, <b>because</b> this <b>is</b> a case of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another,</b> as the phrase: Shall not be made with leaven (Leviticus 2:11), is far from the expression: “It shall not be baked with leaven” (Leviticus 6:10). <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> instance of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another, one cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>them by</b> analyzing them as <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:11 | shall be made with leaven” | Menachot 56b:2 | The Gemara discusses similar cases, including examples involving meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> of the Sages who disagree as to whether one may let the blood of a firstborn animal whose blood circulation is constricted <b>concede that one who leavens</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> another had already <b>leavened</b> it is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the additional leavening, <b>as it is written:</b> “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord <b>shall be made with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 2:11), <b>and</b> it is also stated: <b>“It shall not be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). This indicates that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | that you shall bring | Menachot 57a:13 | <b>Rav Mari raises</b> another <b>dilemma</b> concerning the leavening of a meal offering. If a priest <b>leavened</b> a meal offering while standing <b>at the top of the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the possibilities: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “No meal offering <b>that you shall bring</b> to the Lord shall be made with leaven” (Leviticus 2:11), which indicates that this prohibition applies only to a meal offering that has not yet been brought to the Lord, i.e., to the altar. <b>And</b> therefore, as <b>this</b> meal offering <b>has</b> already been <b>brought</b> to the top of the altar, even though it has not yet been burned, perhaps it is not included in the prohibition. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | The Sages taught | Menachot 57a:8 | § The Gemara returns to discussing the prohibition against leavening a meal offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the deep-pan meal offering, the verse states: “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven; for any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). The term “meal offering” is apparently superfluous, and therefore the <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>Nothing that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven, I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>handful</b> removed from the meal offering for burning on the altar <b>alone</b> is included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall not be made with leaven,”</b> as only the handful is burned on the altar. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | The verse states: “For any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” | Menachot 57b:13 | The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “For any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). The extra term “of it” teaches that <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> has already had some part <b>of it</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not burn,</b> stated in that verse explicitly with regard to honey and leaven. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | But isn’t it taught | Menachot 58a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And may the two loaves not be sacrificed</b> as communal <b>gift</b> offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “As any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it” (Leviticus 2:11): <b>If it is stated: “Any leaven,” why is it stated: “Any honey”? And if it is stated: “Any honey,” why is it stated: “Any leaven”?</b> In other words, why is it necessary for the verse to repeat the inclusive term “any,” from which it is derived that offering an insufficient quantity of honey or leaven is included in the prohibition? The <i>baraita</i> answers: Both of these terms had to be stated, <b>because there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to leaven that is not</b> applicable <b>to honey, and there is</b> another <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to honey that is not</b> applicable <b>to leaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:11 | of leaven and of honey on the altar, Rava says: | Menachot 58b:3 | § The Gemara discusses another dispute between Abaye and Rava on this topic: <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who offers up</b> a mixture made <b>of leaven and of honey on the altar, Rava says:</b> He is flogged with four sets of lashes for this act, as the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11), includes four separate prohibitions. He <b>is flogged</b> one set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>leaven, and he is flogged</b> a second set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>honey,</b> and <b>he is flogged</b> a third set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>mixtures of leaven, and</b> he is flogged a fourth set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>mixtures of honey.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:11 | “A first offering | Menachot 84b:2 | <b>Rabba sat</b> in the study hall <b>and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Aḥa bar Abba raised an objection to Rabba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah refers to the two loaves offering as: <b>“A first offering</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11), which indicates <b>that it is to be the first of all the meal offerings</b> that come from the new crop. <b>And similarly</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>: “On the day of the first fruits, <b>when you bring a new meal offering to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:26). By designating the two loaves as “new,” the verse indicates that they should be brought from the first of the new crop. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | as well, | Nazir 36a:1 | <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> Permitted and forbidden substances combine with regard to <b>the prohibition against offering leaven</b> on the altar, <b>as well,</b> as it states: “For any [<i>kol</i>] leaven and any [<i>kol</i>] honey shall not be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is also liable for sacrificing leaven in a mixture in addition to the liability for sacrificing pure leaven. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ze’eiri issue his ruling? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who derives</b> from the term <b><i>kol</i></b> in the verse “You shall eat nothing [<i>kol</i>] leavened” (Exodus 12:20) that a mixture with part leaven is forbidden on Passover. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | taught | Pesachim 43b:10 | <b>And lest you say that Rabbi Eliezer does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: <b>For anyone [<i>ki kol</i>],</b> as he does not consider this an inclusive expression, the result would be another contradiction. <b>Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: “For no [<i>ki kol</i>] leaven nor any honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before God” (Leviticus 2:11)? Had the verse stated only: <b>You shall not offer leaven, I would have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to sacrifice <b>an entire</b> piece of leaven. <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is also prohibited to sacrifice <b>part of it? The verse states: “No [<i>kol</i>]</b> leaven,” indicating that it is prohibited to sacrifice even part of it. <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is prohibited to sacrifice leaven in <b>a mixture? The verse states: “For no</b> [<b><i>ki kol</i></b>] leaven.” The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Whom did you hear who derives</b> <i>halakhot</i> from the term: <b><i>Kol</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Eliezer, and</b> nevertheless, <b>he derives</b> additional details from the expression: <b><i>Ki kol</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:11 | the prohibition against offering leaven | Pesachim 43b:13 | <b>And Ze’eiri said:</b> Permitted and prohibited substances <b>also</b> combine with regard to <b>the prohibition against offering leaven</b> on the altar, as it states: “For no [<i>kol</i>] leaven and no [<i>kol</i>] honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is also liable for sacrificing leaven in a mixture (<i>Tosafot</i>) in addition to the liability for sacrificing pure leaven. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | shall be made with leaven” | Shabbat 111a:1 | <b>Everyone agrees that one who leavens</b> a meal-offering <b>after one who</b> already <b>leavened it is liable</b> for the additional leavening, <b>as it is stated: “It shall not be baked leavened”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), and it is also stated: “No offering that you sacrifice to God <b>shall be made with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). The Sages interpreted this to mean that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a Temple offering. Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates after one who castrates is liable, as it is stated: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b>, shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). Presumably, <b>if one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether <b>all the more so</b> one is liable. <b>Rather,</b> this comes to <b>include</b> that one who <b>detaches after one who cuts is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for sterilizing one who is already castrated. <b>Rather,</b> we must say that it is permitted to use a remedy that causes sterility <b>in an old man</b> who is no longer capable of procreating. |
| Leviticus 2:11 | But isn’t it written: “For any leavening or fruit honey | Shevuot 12b:1 | They would bring from them <b>dessert, like white figs, for the altar.</b> The Gemara asks: Are white figs ever offered on the altar? <b>But isn’t it written: “For any leavening or fruit honey</b> you shall not cause to go up in smoke as a fire-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11)? The term “fruit honey” includes all tree fruits. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥanina teaches:</b> The supplementary offerings are to the altar <b>like white figs for a person.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:11 | Do not burn. | Sotah 23a:8 | The Gemara asks: One should <b>apply here</b> the principle that in the case of <b>any</b> offering <b>that is</b> meant to be <b>partly</b> burned <b>on the flames</b> of the altar, one who burns the remainder of the offering <b>is</b> subject <b>to</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not burn.</b> This prohibition is derived from the verse: “You shall not burn of it as an offering made by fire unto the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). <b>Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said that</b> the priest <b>burns</b> the remainder not as an offering but <b>for the purpose of firewood.</b> This is permitted, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to those parts of an offering which may not be burned, <b>for a pleasing aroma you may not burn</b> them; <b>however, you may burn them</b> on the altar <b>for the purpose of firewood.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:11 | “you may not make…as an offering” | Yevamot 100a:11 | The Gemara asks: How can it be performed in this manner? There is a principle that should <b>apply here,</b> that <b>whatever is partly</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar <b>is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>“you may not make…as an offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). This principle states that if part of an item, e.g., the blood of an animal offering or the handful of a meal-offering, is burned on the altar, then burning any of its other parts, which are not designated for burning, is prohibited. How, then, can the remainder of the meal-offering be sacrificed? |
| Leviticus 2:12 | the altar | Menachot 57b:17 | The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: After the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord,” the next verse states: “As an offering of first fruits you may bring them to the Lord, but they shall not come up to <b>the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma” (Leviticus 2:12). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to an item that is brought on the <b>altar. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies if it is brought to the <b>ramp</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “But they shall not come up to the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma,” to be accepted, and the ramp is the means to ascend to the altar. |
| Leviticus 2:12 | “Them,” | Menachot 58a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who maintains that the prohibition against bringing leftover portions up to the ramp applies to all of the items listed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>do with this</b> term: <b>“Them,”</b> in the verse: “As an offering of first produce you may bring them” (Leviticus 2:12), from which Rabbi Elazar learns that only first fruits and the two loaves are included in the prohibition? |
| Leviticus 2:12 | for a sweet savor | Yevamot 100a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said that</b> the remainder <b>is brought up</b> to the altar only <b>for the purpose of wood,</b> i.e., as fuel for the altar, not as an offering. In this manner, it is permitted. This answer is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> “But they shall not come up <b>for a sweet savor</b> on the altar” (Leviticus 2:12). This verse indicates that <b>you may not bring up</b> leaven and honey as a “sweet savor,” i.e., an offering. <b>However, you may bring up</b> leaven, and honey, and other materials <b>for the purpose of wood.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:12 | for a sweet savor | Yoma 47b:6 | <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said that</b> the priest does not burn the flour as part of the meal-offering but <b>burns it for the purpose of wood.</b> In other words, he does not burn the flour as part of an offering but merely as fuel for the altar, which is permitted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> “But they shall not come up <b>for a sweet savor</b> on the altar” (Leviticus 2:12). This verse indicates that <b>you</b> may <b>not bring up</b> leaven and honey as a “sweet savor,” an offering. <b>However, you</b> may <b>bring up</b> leaven and honey and other materials <b>for the purpose of wood.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:13 | should not be excluded | Berakhot 5a:19 | <b>And that is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, and</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions.</b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, as it is written: “The salt of the covenant</b> with your God <b>should not be excluded</b> from your meal-offering; with all your sacrifices you must offer salt” (Leviticus 2:13). <b>And</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:69). <b>Just as,</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to salt, the salt sweetens</b> the taste of <b>the meat</b> and renders it edible, <b>so too</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to suffering, the suffering cleanses a person’s transgressions,</b> purifying him for a more sublime existence. |
| Leviticus 2:13 | the verse states: “You shall sacrifice salt with all your offerings” | Menachot 20a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall sacrifice salt with all your offerings”</b> (Leviticus 2:13), demonstrating that everything burned on the altar requires salting. From this <i>baraita</i>, it is apparent that the mitzva to apply salt is necessary in order to teach about the circumstances where salt is added, and therefore it cannot be used as an instance where the mitzva is repeated in order to teach that the rite is indispensable. |
| Leviticus 2:13 | he is saying: | Menachot 20a:14 | The Gemara answers: When the <i>tanna</i> says: I have derived only that the handful of the meal offering requires salting, <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying:</b> One might understand the verse “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13) differently and <b>say</b> the following exposition: The term <b>“offering”</b> that appears here is <b>a generalization,</b> while <b>“meal offering”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> According to the hermeneutical principles, in the case of <b>a generalization and a detail, there is nothing in the generalization other than what is in the detail.</b> Therefore, in the case of <b>a meal offering, yes,</b> it requires salting, but <b>anything else</b> does <b>not</b> require salting. From where, then, is the <i>halakha</i> of salting in all other cases derived? |
| Leviticus 2:13 | with all your offerings” | Menachot 20a:15 | Therefore, the verse <b>then states:</b> “You shall sacrifice salt <b>with all your offerings”</b> (Leviticus 2:13), and <b>it then generalized</b> again, so that the verse includes <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> in which case according to the hermeneutical principles <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the specified detail,</b> i.e., the meal offering, is unique in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it, so too, anything</b> that is unique in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it</b> requires the application of salt. That is why the latter part of the verse is needed. |
| Leviticus 2:13 | is not repeated in the verse? But isn’t it written: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” | Menachot 20a:5 | With regard to the question that was raised to challenge the statement of Rav, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it correct that the application of salt <b>is not repeated in the verse? But isn’t it written: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt”</b> (Leviticus 2:13)? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse does not function as a repetition, since it is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> only: And every <b>offering</b> you shall season <b>with salt, I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to even the <b>wood and</b> the <b>blood, which are</b> also <b>termed: An offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:13 | offering [ korban ] | Menachot 20a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the entire meal offering requires salting,</b> including the remainder of the offering that is eaten by the priests. To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “And every meal <b>offering [<i>korban</i>]</b> of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13), teaching that the handful, which is burned as <b>an offering [<i>korban</i>]</b> on the altar, <b>requires salting, but the entire meal offering [<i>minḥa</i>] does not require salting.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:13 | termed: An offering. | Menachot 20b:2 | § The Gemara continues discussing the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above: Had the verse stated only: And every offering you shall season with salt, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to <b>even</b> the <b>wood and</b> the <b>blood, which are</b> also <b>termed: An offering.</b> Therefore, the verse states “and every meal offering of yours” (Leviticus 2:13), to teach that just as the meal offering is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it, so too, anything that is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it requires the application of salt. Therefore, the wood and the blood do not require salting, as in their case no other item is needed. The Gemara asks: <b>Whom did you hear who says</b> that the <b>wood is termed an offering?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, doesn’t the wood in fact <b>require salting?</b> |
| Leviticus 2:13 | you shall sacrifice | Menachot 21a:16 | The continuation of the verse: <b>“And you shall not omit [<i>tashbit</i>] salt</b> from your meal offering,” teaches that <b>one should bring salt that never rests [<i>shovetet</i>],</b> i.e., it is found continuously. <b>And what</b> type of salt <b>is this? This</b> is referring to <b>salt of Sodom. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one did not find salt of Sodom that he should bring salt of <i>istrokanit</i>,</b> which is quarried from rock? <b>The verse states</b> immediately afterward: “With all your offerings <b>you shall sacrifice</b> salt” (Leviticus 2:13), in order to emphasize that <b>you should sacrifice any</b> type of salt; <b>you should sacrifice</b> salt <b>from any place,</b> even from a location outside of Eretz Yisrael; <b>you should sacrifice</b> salt <b>even on Shabbat;</b> and <b>you should sacrifice</b> salt <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:13 | Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: | Menachot 21a:3 | The Gemara suggests: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>,</b> who explains the verse that was interpreted in the <i>baraita</i> in a different manner. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The verse states: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13). <b>Just as the specified detail,</b> i.e., the meal offering, is <b>an item that is susceptible to ritual impurity, and is brought on the fire</b> of the altar, <b>and is</b> sacrificed <b>on the external altar, so too, any item that is susceptible to ritual impurity, and is brought on the fire</b> of the altar, <b>and is</b> sacrificed <b>on the external altar</b> requires salting. |
| Leviticus 2:13 | bring salt, | Menachot 21b:8 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that we provide salt for the offerings of Israelites: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering, must bring salt from his home,</b> i.e., his own salt, to salt the handful that is burned on the altar, <b>just as he brings frankincense from his home</b> for his meal offering. <b>And</b> this would seem to be <b>a logical inference:</b> It <b>is stated</b> in the Torah that one shall <b>bring a meal offering, and</b> it is stated that one shall <b>bring salt,</b> as it is written: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13); <b>and</b> it <b>is stated</b> that one shall <b>bring a meal offering, and</b> it is stated that one shall <b>bring frankincense.</b> Therefore, <b>just as</b> one brings <b>frankincense from his home,</b> as it is written: “And put frankincense on it. And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests” (Leviticus 2:1–2), <b>so too,</b> one must bring <b>salt from his home.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:13 | As it is written: “And every meal-offering of yours you shall season with salt” | Sotah 15a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he salts it and places it on the fires.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written: “And every meal-offering of yours you shall season with salt”</b> (Leviticus 2:13). |
| Leviticus 2:14 | fresh ear [ karmel ]” | Menachot 64b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the barley reaped for the <i>omer</i> meal offering should ideally be brought from fields proximate to Jerusalem? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>because</b> the verse states: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the <b>fresh ear [<i>karmel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:14). This indicates that the grain should be soft and fresh. Consequently it should be brought from close by, not from a place where it might become stale and hardened during a long journey. |
| Leviticus 2:14 | in order to fulfill the mitzva of parched | Menachot 66a:17 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> After <b>they harvested</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>and placed it in</b> the <b>baskets, they brought it to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. And they would singe in</b> the <b>fire</b> the kernels of barley while they were still on the stalks, <b>in order to fulfill the mitzva of parched</b> grain, as it is written: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire” (Leviticus 2:14). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Prior to parching the kernels, they would remove them from the stalks by <b>beating</b> them <b>with</b> soft, moist <b>reeds and with cabbage stalks,</b> not with sticks, <b>so that</b> the kernels <b>would not be crushed.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:14 | The Sages taught | Menachot 66a:19 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna cited a disagreement between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis as to whether the barley kernels were first singed while they were in their stalks or only after they were beaten and removed from their stalks, when they were placed in a hollow vessel. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). <b>“Grain in the ear”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>grain,</b> i.e., the barley kernel. <b>“Parched [<i>kalui</i>] with fire”;</b> this <b>teaches that the Jewish people would singe it in fire, in order to fulfill the mitzva of</b> bringing <b>parched</b> grain. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> |
| Leviticus 2:14 | groats | Menachot 66b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> analyzes the verse: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the <b>ear parched with fire,</b> even <b>groats</b> of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). This indicates that the grain used for the <i>omer</i> offering must be parched with fire, but is unclear if that clause modifies the earlier or later part of the verse. In other words, <b>I do not know if</b> grain in the <b>ear</b> is to be parched before it is ground, or <b>if</b> the ground <b>groats</b> are to be <b>parched.</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: With fire, it interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter</b> and is now introducing a new clause. Accordingly, the instructions to parch with fire is referring to the grain still in the stalks, not the ground groats. |
| Leviticus 2:14 | “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits | Menachot 68b:19 | <b>Rabba said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits</b> to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). <b>The verse is speaking of the <i>omer</i> meal offering. From where,</b> i.e., of which grain, <b>is it brought?</b> It is brought <b>from barley.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that it is brought <b>from barley, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only from wheat?</b> |
| Leviticus 2:14 | grain in the ear | Menachot 71a:2 | Rabbi Yoshiya responded: <b>From where do we</b> derive, you ask? The source is <b>that it is written:</b> “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits <b>grain in the ear</b> parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). Can one <b>not</b> learn from here <b>by inference</b> that although the <i>omer</i> offering must be from fully formed grain, <b>there is</b> less-developed grain at an earlier stage <b>that is not “grain in the ear,”</b> i.e., grain that may not be used for the <i>omer</i> offering but is nevertheless permitted by the <i>omer</i>? |
| Leviticus 2:14 | the verse states: | Menachot 72a:4 | § The mishna teaches that <b>the mitzva of the <i>omer</i></b> is <b>to bring</b> the barley <b>from the standing grain. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14)? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since the mitzva of the <i>omer</i></b> is <b>to bring</b> the barley <b>from the standing grain, from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one does not find</b> barley <b>from the standing grain,</b> he should <b>bring</b> it <b>from the</b> harvested and gathered <b>sheaves? The verse states: “You shall bring,”</b> to include this scenario. |
| Leviticus 2:14 | you shall bring the meal offering of your first fruits” | Menachot 83b:14 | The Gemara provides the biblical sources for the rulings of the <i>baraita</i>: The source for the ruling concerning the <b><i>omer</i></b> meal offering is <b>as it is written:</b> “And when you shall bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, it is ripened grain, toasted over fire, even groats of the fresh ear, <b>you shall bring the meal offering of your first fruits”</b> (Leviticus 2:14). The superfluous repetition of the term “you shall bring” teaches that the <i>omer</i> is valid <b>even</b> if brought <b>from</b> an old crop that was stored away in <b>the attic.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:14 | “And when you shall bring a meal offering of first fruits | Menachot 84a:10 | <b>Rabba raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And when you shall bring a meal offering of first fruits</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:14). <b>The verse is speaking of the <i>omer</i> meal offering. From which</b> type of grain <b>does it come?</b> It comes <b>from barley. Do you say</b> that it comes <b>from barley, or</b> does <b>it</b> come <b>only from wheat?</b> |
| Leviticus 2:14 | “fresh ear” | Menachot 84a:7 | Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him: But am I saying</b> that the <i>omer</i> <b>should be canceled?</b> Certainly not. <b>Let one bring</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from</b> grain that sprouted during <b>the previous year,</b> concerning which there is no prohibition against burning it. Rav Ḥisda rejects this suggestion: But to fulfill the mitzva <b>I require that</b> the grain be of the <b>“fresh ear”</b> (Leviticus 2:14), i.e., young grain, <b>and</b> this requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled with grain that sprouted during the previous year, as it has already been growing a long time. |
| Leviticus 2:14 | The verse states: “Fresh ear, you shall bring” | Menachot 84a:8 | Rami bar Ḥama persists: <b>But let one bring</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from the young grain</b> that was cut during the harvest <b>of</b> the <b>previous year,</b> when it was still fresh. Rav Ḥisda rejects this suggestion: <b>The verse states: “Fresh ear, you shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 2:14). The juxtaposition of the mitzva to bring the grain with the requirement that it be young indicates that <b>I need</b> it to still be <b>young grain at the time of offering</b> it, <b>and</b> this condition <b>is not</b> fulfilled if one uses grain from the previous year’s harvest. Young grain is soft (see 66b), whereas grain that was reaped during the previous year would have become brittle. |
| Leviticus 2:15 | frankincense upon it” | Menachot 59a:19 | The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> The phrase: “And lay <b>frankincense upon it”</b> (Leviticus 2:15), teaches that one must place frankincense upon the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>frankincense upon the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations.</b> The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state that this verse excludes the meal offering brought with libations? One can <b>say:</b> One places <b>frankincense upon</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>frankincense upon the meal offering of priests.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:15 | “Meal offering” | Menachot 59a:25 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the term: <b>“Meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:15), serves <b>to include</b> the <b>meal offering of the eighth</b> day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle <b>in</b> the requirement of <b>frankincense.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this term serves <b>to exclude</b> the meal offering of the eighth day from the requirement of frankincense. The Gemara is puzzled by this suggestion: <b>What is this</b> suggestion? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the verse serves <b>to include</b> the meal offering of the eighth day of inauguration in the requirement of frankincense, it works out <b>well.</b> This is because the only reason one could know that the requirement of frankincense applies would be that the <i>halakha</i> of this meal offering, which was brought on one occasion, is derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering that is brought in all generations. |
| Leviticus 2:15 | “It is” | Menachot 59a:27 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the term: <b>“It is”</b> (Leviticus 2:15), serves <b>to exclude the two loaves</b> sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, to indicate <b>that they will require neither oil nor frankincense.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this serves <b>to exclude the meal offering of priests</b> from the requirements of oil and frankincense. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>the meal offering of priests should be included</b> in these requirements, while the two loaves should be excluded, <b>as</b> the meal offering of priests is similar to the <i>omer</i> meal offering in several respects that do not apply to the two loaves. The Gemara elaborates: Both are prepared from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, unlike the two loaves, which are prepared from two-tenths. |
| Leviticus 2:15 | “And you shall put oil upon it | Menachot 59a:7 | § The mishna teaches that the <i>omer</i> meal offering requires both oil and frankincense. With regard to this meal offering, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall put oil upon it</b> and lay frankincense upon it; it is a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:15). From this it can be inferred: One must put oil specifically “upon it,” <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>oil upon the shewbread.</b> |
| Leviticus 2:16 | as the verse states: “Of its groats, and of its oil” | Menachot 19a:22 | The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to the meal offering, it <b>is different,</b> and it is only the rites that are repeated that are indispensable, <b>as the verse states: “Of its groats, and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:16), rather than simply: Of the groats and oil, |
| Leviticus 2:16 | “Of its groats, and of its oil” | Menachot 27a:9 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the fine flour and the oil,</b> failure to bring <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the fact that the two are juxtaposed in the verse: “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and the fact that this requirement is repeated in the verse: <b>“Of its groats, and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:16), teaches that each is indispensable. |
| Leviticus 2:16 | of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof” | Sotah 14b:19 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he removes a handful from the place where its oil has accumulated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take from there his handful <b>of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The Torah also states: “And the priest shall make the memorial part of it smoke, even <b>of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:16). The handful should be taken from the area where there is an abundance of oil. |
| Leviticus 3:1 | as the Sages taught | Bekhorot 15b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that the offspring of a sacrificial animal is imbued with inherent sanctity, derived? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings: If he sacrifice of the cattle, whether male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:1), that the words “male” and “female” are extraneous, as the term “cattle” includes both. Consequently, <b>“male”</b> serves <b>to include the offspring</b> of a peace offering; <b>“or female”</b> serves <b>to include the</b> female animal that is designated as <b>a substitute</b> for a peace offering. |
| Leviticus 3:1 | “Whether male or female” | Bekhorot 42a:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> discussing the peace offering, with regard to which it states: <b>“Whether male or female”</b> (Leviticus 3:1). This indicates: Only <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> Yet again the Gemara responds: <b>Omit from</b> this <i>baraita</i> the mention of <b>a <i>tumtum</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:1 | of the herd, | Bekhorot 61a:5 | <b>And furthermore,</b> there is a source that indicates that Rabbi Yehuda holds that a mistakenly designated animal tithe is sacrificed, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i>: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings: <b>If</b> he sacrifice <b>of the herd,</b> whether male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:1). This serves <b>to include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> animal mistakenly designated as tithe; it must be sacrificed <b>as a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:1 | “His offering” | Menachot 92b:17 | Leviticus, chapter 3, discusses peace offerings and details the obligation of placing hands. The term “his offering” is mentioned a number of times. Each time serves to emphasize that peace offerings require placing hands and to exclude another type of offering from that requirement. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> detailing which offerings are excluded and why one might have thought otherwise. <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:1) requires placing hands, <b>but not the firstborn</b> offering. <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>If a peace offering, whose consecration does not</b> originate <b>from</b> being in its mother’s <b>womb,</b> nevertheless <b>requires placing hands,</b> then with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering, <b>whose consecration</b> originates <b>from the womb, is it not logical that it requires placing hands?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,”</b> teaching that a peace offering requires placing hands <b>but the firstborn</b> offering does <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:1 | As the Sages taught | Temurah 17b:5 | § With regard to the mishna’s statement that the halakhic status of the offspring of peace offerings and their substitutes are like that of the peace offering itself, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings: If he offer of the herd, if male if female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:1). Since the verse already states: “If he offer of the herd,” the words “if male if female” are unnecessary. Rather, the word <b>“male”</b> serves <b>to include the offspring</b> of a peace offering as having the the same halakhic status as a peace offering. |
| Leviticus 3:1 | “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings for the Lord” | Temurah 18a:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that the offspring of a peace offering does not have the status of a peace offering? It is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a peace offering: <b>“And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings for the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 3:1). The term <b>“and if [<i>ve’im</i>],”</b> can be read as: And a mother [<i>ve’em</i>], which teaches that the mother may be offered as a peace offering, <b>but not the offspring.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:1 | as the verse states: “And if his offering is a sacrifice [ zevaḥ ] of peace offerings” | Zevachim 4a:1 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that we require</b> that an offering’s <b>slaughter</b> be performed <b>for its own sake?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And if his offering is a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 3:1), teaching <b>that slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>] must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:1 | But isn’t it taught | Zevachim 99b:12 | The Gemara counters: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings [<i>shelamim</i>]” (Leviticus 3:1), <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The offering is called <b><i>shelamim</i></b> to teach that <b>when</b> a person <b>is whole [<i>shalem</i>],</b> i.e., in a state of contentment, <b>he brings</b> his offering, <b>but he does not bring</b> it <b>when he is an acute mourner. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> that an acute mourner does not bring even <b>a thanks offering? I include the thanks offering because it is consumed in</b> a state of <b>joy, like a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “His offering” | Arakhin 2a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> With regard to placing of hands, he expounds the term: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), as teaching that one places his hands only on his own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering. And</b> with regard to the ruling that an heir cannot effect substitution, Rabbi Yehuda <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution, in which a previously non-sacred animal is consecrated, <b>from the final stage of consecration,</b> the act of placing hands, which is performed upon an already-consecrated animal immediately before it is slaughtered: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir does not place hands, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir cannot effect substitution.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:2 | and slaughter it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, | Eruvin 2a:8 | The Gemara explains the basis of this tannaitic dispute. <b>Both of them,</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda, <b>interpreted the same verse homiletically:</b> “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering <b>and slaughter it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting,</b> and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about” (Leviticus 3:2). <b>As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the sanctity of the Sanctuary is discrete and the sanctity of the Entrance Hall is discrete,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall have distinct levels of sanctity. <b>And</b> since the essence of the Temple is the Sanctuary and not the Entrance Hall, and since the Sanctuary in the Temple parallels the Tent of Meeting in the Tabernacle, <b>when</b> the verse <b>speaks of the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, it is referring to</b> the doorway of <b>the Sanctuary.</b> Therefore, the term doorway applies to an opening similar to the doorway of the Sanctuary, which is twenty cubits high. There is no source indicating that an opening with larger dimensions is also considered a doorway. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “and he slaughters it” | Kiddushin 57b:14 | Abaye quotes a lengthy <i>baraita</i> that serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is derived <b>from here:</b> The Torah states <b>three verses that</b> have <b>a superfluous</b> element with regard to the various species from which one may bring a peace-offering: The verse <b>“and he slaughters it”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), and the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). The Torah could simply have stated: “And he shall slaughter,” without adding: “It.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the term “it” these three times? |
| Leviticus 3:2 | slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is written: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Menachot 8a:12 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>matter</b> with regard to consecrated items <b>from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Peace offerings that</b> were <b>slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is written: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: It is logical <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area, i.e., the courtyard, <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>major</b> area, the Tent of Meeting. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan derives a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Sanctuary from the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Menachot 8b:17 | § The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Peace offerings that</b> were <b>slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard. <b>And</b> it is logical that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area, i.e., the courtyard, <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one, the Tent of Meeting or the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “His offering” | Menachot 92b:18 | <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:2) requires placing hands, <b>but not the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering. <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>If peace offerings,</b> which are unlike the animal tithe in that their designation <b>does not consecrate</b> the animals <b>before and after them,</b> i.e., this unique stringency of animal tithe does not apply to them, nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>which can consecrate</b> the animals <b>before and after it,</b> as in the case where the ninth or eleventh animal to be counted was mistakenly designated as the tenth animal, <b>is it not logical that it requires placing hands?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,”</b> teaching that a peace offering requires placing hands, <b>but the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering does <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “His hand” | Menachot 93b:4 | § The mishna states: A Canaanite <b>slave, the agent</b> of the owner of the offering who brings the offering on his behalf, <b>and a woman</b> do not place hands on their offerings. Concerning these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term “his hand” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3, which details the requirement of placing hands. Each mention is expounded to exclude a different case. <b>“His hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not the hand of his</b> Canaanite <b>slave; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not the hand of his agent; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not the hand of his wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “his hand upon the head” | Menachot 93b:9 | § The mishna further states that that placing hands is performed by leaning <b>on the head</b> of the offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase “his hand upon the head” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3. Each mention is expounded to exclude the possibility of performing the rite on a different part of the animal’s body. Placing hands is performed with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the neck</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the back</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the breast</b> of the animal. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | The Sages taught | Menachot 94a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to placing hands: “And he shall place his hand on the head of his offering” (Leviticus 3:2). The term <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> of the <b>owners of an offering</b> in the requirement <b>of placing hands,</b> i.e., each one must perform it. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “And he shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” | Yoma 62b:20 | <b>Ravina said: Now that Rav Ḥisda said</b> that although the drawing of lots is external to the animals themselves, an animal <b>lacking the lottery is comparable to</b> an animal <b>lacking an action</b> and is not yet considered a valid offering, a statement can be made with regard to <b>that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Peace-offerings that one slaughtered</b> in the Temple <b>before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are disqualified,</b> as <b>it is stated</b> with regard to peace-offerings: <b>“And he shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), which teaches that it must be slaughtered <b>when</b> the entrance <b>is open</b> and serves as an actual entrance, <b>but not when it is locked.</b> As long as the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or in the Temple the doors to the Sanctuary, remain closed, one may not sacrifice the peace-offerings, and if they are sacrificed, they are disqualified. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 55a:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to cattle peace offerings, the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2). With regard to sheep peace offerings the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:8). With regard to goat peace offerings the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, <b>and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). |
| Leviticus 3:2 | What is different here that it is written: “At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 55b:3 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that it is written: “At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>and what is different there that it is written: “Before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:8, 13)? The Gemara answers: This <b>teaches us</b> a matter <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered</b> in the Temple <b>before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are disqualified, as it is stated</b> with regard to peace offerings: <b>“And he shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), which teaches that it must be slaughtered <b>when</b> the entrance <b>is open</b> and serves as an actual entrance, <b>and not when it is locked.</b> As long as the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or in the Temple the doors to the Sanctuary, remain closed, one may not sacrifice the peace offerings, and if they are sacrificed, they are disqualified. |
| Leviticus 3:2 | “He shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 55b:4 | <b>It was also stated: Mar Ukva bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are disqualified, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“He shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2). This means <b>when the entrance of the Sanctuary is open, and not when it is locked.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:2 | Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 63a:14 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard; <b>and</b> the courtyard, which is of <b>secondary</b> sanctity, <b>should not be weightier than the</b> place of <b>primary</b> sanctity. Accordingly, as the offering is valid if it was slaughtered in the courtyard, it is certainly valid if it was slaughtered in the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 3:3 | “All the fat that is upon the innards” | Chullin 49a:20 | It was stated that the priests accustomed themselves to permit the fat on the abomasum, in accordance with the statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael that he says in the name of his forefathers.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this statement? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states with regard to forbidden fats mentioned in the Torah: <b>“All the fat that is upon the innards”</b> (Leviticus 3:3), |
| Leviticus 3:3 | the fat that is upon the innards” | Chullin 49b:2 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The fat that covers the innards, and all <b>the fat that is upon the innards”</b> (Leviticus 3:3). <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says: Just as the fat that covers the innards</b> possesses <b>a membrane, and</b> that membrane is easily <b>peeled</b> off, <b>so too, all</b> fat possessing <b>a membrane and</b> whose membrane is easily <b>peeled</b> is forbidden, including the fat on the abomasum. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Just as the fat that covers the innards is spread out</b> loosely over them, and it possesses <b>a membrane, and</b> the membrane is easily <b>peeled</b> off, <b>so too, all</b> fat that is <b>spread out</b> loosely, and possesses <b>a membrane, and</b> whose membrane is easily <b>peeled,</b> e.g., the fat on the intestines, is forbidden. The fat on the abomasum is fixed tightly and is therefore permitted. It would seem from this <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael contradict themselves. |
| Leviticus 3:3 | takes a handful | Chullin 50a:4 | The Gemara adds: When it was stated that only the residents of Eretz Yisrael permit the fat on the bowstring for consumption, this means that they would eat it in a manner <b>like that which Rav Avya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> One <b>takes a handful</b> of the fat that lies above the fat on the bowstring, since this is the fat prohibited by the verse: “And all the fat that is upon the innards” (Leviticus 3:3), and the rest is permitted for consumption. <b>And so says Rabbi Yannai,</b> also a resident of Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of a certain elder:</b> One <b>takes a handful. Rav Avya said: I was standing before Rabbi Ami.</b> The people there <b>took a handful</b> of the fat on the bowstring <b>and gave him</b> the remaining fat, <b>and he ate</b> from it. |
| Leviticus 3:4 | “And the two kidneys” | Bekhorot 39a:18 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that this matter is subject to a dispute. It is taught in one <i>baraita</i>: When it states with regard to the burning of the sacrificial portions of a peace offering: <b>“And the two kidneys”</b> (Leviticus 3:4), this teaches that one sacrifices only an animal that has two kidneys, <b>but not</b> an animal that <b>has one kidney, nor</b> one that <b>has three kidneys. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that when that verse states: “And the two kidneys…<b>he shall take it away,”</b> the singular form serves <b>to include</b> an animal that <b>has one kidney,</b> which may be sacrificed. Evidently, these <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to whether an animal lacking a kidney is fit to be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 3:5 | as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall burn it” | Kiddushin 36a:20 | With regard to the <b>burning</b> of sacrificial parts, this is <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall burn it”</b> (Leviticus 3:5). This teaches that it is <b>the sons of Aaron</b> who burn the parts, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:6 | is of the flock” | Menachot 83b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is it derived from here</b> that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? <b>It is derived from</b> the verse <b>that Shmuel’s father</b> cites: <b>As it is written:</b> “And <b>if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings</b> to the Lord <b>is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6); <b>and Shmuel’s father said:</b> This teaches that an offering <b>that is brought</b> only <b>from the flock,</b> i.e., the Paschal offering, <b>will be a sacrifice of peace offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:6 | And isn’t it taught | Menachot 83b:3 | <b>But still</b> it must be asked: <b>Is it derived from here? It is derived from there,</b> from the verse cited in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even though the verse already states that peace offerings come from the flock, as it is written: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord be of the flock, male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish” (Leviticus 3:6), the verse goes on to specify: “If he bring a lamb for his offering…and if his offering be a goat” (Leviticus 3:7–12). The word <b>“lamb”</b> is written <b>to include the Paschal offering in</b> the requirement that the <b>fat tail</b> be sacrificed on the altar, which is written subsequently with regard to a peace offering (Leviticus 3:9), since this <i>halakha</i> is not mentioned in the verses concerning the Paschal offering. |
| Leviticus 3:6 | “His offering” | Menachot 92b:19 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:6) requires placing hands, <b>but not the Paschal offering. As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>If peace offerings, which are not</b> subject to a positive mitzva to <b>arise and bring</b> them, nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to <b>a Paschal offering, which is</b> subject to a positive mitzva to <b>arise and bring</b> it, <b>is it not logical that it requires placing hands?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,”</b> teaching that a peace offering requires placing hands, <b>but the Paschal offering</b> does <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:6 | Shmuel’s father says: The verse states: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord is of the flock” | Zevachim 8b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., that if a Paschal offering is sacrificed during the rest of the year it is fit if sacrificed not for its sake? <b>Shmuel’s father says: The verse states: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6), indicating that an offering <b>that is brought</b> only <b>from the flock will be a sacrifice of peace offerings.</b> The Paschal offering fulfills this criterion. |
| Leviticus 3:6 | is of the flock” | Zevachim 9a:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is it derived from here</b> that a Paschal offering that is too old to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? <b>It is derived from</b> the verse <b>that Shmuel’s father</b> cites, <b>as Shmuel’s father says:</b> The verse: <b>“And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings</b> unto the Lord <b>is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6), teaches that an offering <b>that is brought</b> only <b>from the flock,</b> i.e., the Paschal offering, <b>will be a sacrifice of peace offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:7 | a lamb” | Keritot 28b:7 | <b>Ravina said:</b> Yissakhar did <b>not even read the Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to the peace offering: <b>“If</b> he sacrifices <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and it further states: <b>“If a goat</b> is his offering” (Leviticus 3:12). These verses indicate that one is permitted to bring whichever animal he wishes, and there is no preference. |
| Leviticus 3:7 | a lamb | Pesachim 96b:11 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava based on a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: <b>“If</b> he brings <b>a lamb</b> for his offering” (Leviticus 3:7), <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> he brings <b>a lamb”?</b> What is added by the word “if”? It comes <b>to include the substitute of a Paschal lamb after</b> the slaughter of the replacement <b>Paschal lamb</b> and teaches <b>that it is offered as a peace-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:7 | “If he sacrifices a lamb | Temurah 18b:1 | § <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>to support</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> that all agree that the offspring of the offspring of a peace offering is not sacrificed: The verse states: <b>“If he sacrifices a lamb</b> for his offering, then shall he present it before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:7). Two limitations are derived from this verse: The word “lamb” indicates that <b>the first offspring,</b> i.e., the offspring of the peace offering, <b>is sacrificed,</b> but <b>the second offspring,</b> i.e., the offspring of the offspring, <b>is not sacrificed.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:7 | is explicitly written concerning it. | Zevachim 37b:7 | With regard to the <b>Paschal offering,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is not derived through a verbal analogy, but rather this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written concerning it.</b> The verse referring to peace offerings states: “If he offers a lamb for his offering” (Leviticus 3:7). The Torah could simply have stated: <b>A lamb,</b> and proceed from there to teach the <i>halakhot</i> of a lamb peace offering. If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> he offers <b>a lamb”?</b> This serves <b>to include the substitute of a Paschal offering</b> that was substituted <b>after</b> the sacrifice of <b>the Paschal offering,</b> teaching <b>that it is sacrificed as a peace offering,</b> since the Paschal offering has the status of a peace offering after that time. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even before</b> the sacrifice of <b>the Paschal offering the same</b> should apply, i.e., that the substitute of a Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27), which indicates that <b>it,</b> the Paschal offering itself, is sacrificed, but its substitute is not sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 3:7 | a lamb” | Zevachim 9a:19 | The Gemara cites another objection. <b>Rav Ḥana of Baghdad objects to this: How can you say that when this</b> verse <b>is written, it is written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering? But from</b> that <b>which is written</b> in the subsequent verses: <b>“If</b> he brings <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and <b>“if</b> his offering is <b>a goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), one learns <b>by inference that</b> the passage is <b>not written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering;</b> the Torah states elsewhere, in Exodus 12:5, that a Paschal offering is brought from both lambs and goats, and it is unnecessary to teach this again in Leviticus. |
| Leviticus 3:8 | “and he shall slaughter it” | Kiddushin 57b:14 | Abaye quotes a lengthy <i>baraita</i> that serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is derived <b>from here:</b> The Torah states <b>three verses that</b> have <b>a superfluous</b> element with regard to the various species from which one may bring a peace-offering: The verse <b>“and he slaughters it”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), and the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). The Torah could simply have stated: “And he shall slaughter,” without adding: “It.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the term “it” these three times? |
| Leviticus 3:8 | and slaughter it” | Megillah 20b:15 | <b>For placing hands</b> on the head of an offering <b>and for slaughtering</b> an offering, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And he shall lay</b> his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), comparing the laying of hands to slaughtering. <b>And it is written with regard to slaughtering: “On the day that you slaughter”</b> (Leviticus 19:6), meaning during the day and not at night. <b>And for waving</b> the offerings that require waving, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And on the day you wave the <i>omer</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:12). |
| Leviticus 3:8 | slave; “his hand” | Menachot 93b:4 | § The mishna states: A Canaanite <b>slave, the agent</b> of the owner of the offering who brings the offering on his behalf, <b>and a woman</b> do not place hands on their offerings. Concerning these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term “his hand” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3, which details the requirement of placing hands. Each mention is expounded to exclude a different case. <b>“His hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not the hand of his</b> Canaanite <b>slave; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not the hand of his agent; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not the hand of his wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:8 | “his hand upon the head” | Menachot 93b:9 | § The mishna further states that that placing hands is performed by leaning <b>on the head</b> of the offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase “his hand upon the head” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3.

| Leviticus 3:8 | and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 55a:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to cattle peace offerings, the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2). With regard to sheep peace offerings the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:8). With regard to goat peace offerings the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, <b>and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). |
| Leviticus 3:9 | the fat tail whole, | Chullin 11a:10 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>tail</b> of a lamb brought as a peace offering, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “And he shall sacrifice of the peace offering…<b>the fat tail whole,</b> which he shall remove opposite the rump bone” (Leviticus 3:9), meaning that the tail must remain intact and may not be cut. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak suggested: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the segment of <b>the spinal column</b> in the tail <b>was severed</b> prior to slaughter, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>? |
| Leviticus 3:9 | fat tail | Menachot 83b:3 | <b>But still</b> it must be asked: <b>Is it derived from here? It is derived from there,</b> from the verse cited in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even though the verse already states that peace offerings come from the flock, as it is written: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord be of the flock, male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish” (Leviticus 3:6), the verse goes on to specify: “If he bring a lamb for his offering…and if his offering be a goat” (Leviticus 3:7–12). The word <b>“lamb”</b> is written <b>to include the Paschal offering in</b> the requirement that the <b>fat tail</b> be sacrificed on the altar, which is written subsequently with regard to a peace offering (Leviticus 3:9), since this <i>halakha</i> is not mentioned in the verses concerning the Paschal offering. |
| Leviticus 3:9 | The fat thereof, the fat tail” | Zevachim 28a:6 | <b>Rav Huna says: The skin of</b> the <b>tail is not considered as</b> though it were the <b>tail</b> itself. Unlike the tail itself, its skin is consumed. Consequently, both this mishna and the next can be understood in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>Rava said: What is the reasoning of Rav Huna?</b> As the verse states: “And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire unto the Lord: <b>The fat thereof, the fat tail”</b> (Leviticus 3:9), indicating that the priest must offer the fat of the tail on the altar, <b>but not the skin of the tail.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:9 | tail | Zevachim 9a:20 | The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> verses <b>are necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b>“lamb”</b> is written <b>to include the Paschal offering in</b> the requirement that the <b>tail</b> be offered on the altar, which is written subsequently with regard to a peace offering (Leviticus 3:9), since this <i>halakha</i> is not mentioned in the verses concerning the Paschal offering. |
| Leviticus 3:11 | shall burn it | Pesachim 64b:10 | The Gemara questions one of the details of this story: How could the High Priest <b>take a kidney?</b> Didn’t <b>he have to burn it</b> on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>He</b> first took the kidneys for the count, and <b>subsequently he burned them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written: “And</b> the priest <b>shall burn it</b> on the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 3:11)? The singular “it” apparently indicates that <b>he must not mix</b> the <b>fats of this</b> sacrifice <b>with</b> those of <b>another;</b> rather, he must burn each set separately. |
| Leviticus 3:12 | “If a goat | Keritot 28b:7 | <b>Ravina said:</b> Yissakhar did <b>not even read the Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to the peace offering: <b>“If</b> he sacrifices <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and it further states: <b>“If a goat</b> is his offering” (Leviticus 3:12). These verses indicate that one is permitted to bring whichever animal he wishes, and there is no preference. |
| Leviticus 3:12 | “if a goat” | Pesachim 57b:2 | <b>Rav Ashi said: Yissakhar of Kfar Barkai did not study</b> the <b>Mishna</b> and was an ignoramus who did not know that this <i>halakha</i> is stated explicitly in the mishna. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs take precedence</b> over <b>goats in every place</b> they are mentioned in the Bible. I <b>might</b> have thought that this is <b>because it is a</b> more <b>select species.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If he brings a lamb as his offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32). The Torah passage where bringing a lamb as a sin-offering is discussed appears after the passage describing the sin-offering of a goat. The inconsistent order <b>teaches that both</b> these animals <b>are equal. Ravina said:</b> Yissakhar did not <b>even read the Bible</b> properly, <b>as it is written: “If a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), <b>“if a goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), teaching: <b>If one wishes let him bring a lamb; if one wishes let him bring a goat.</b> There is no clear preference. |
| Leviticus 3:12 | she-goat” | Pesachim 96b:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And when it says: “And if</b> his offering is a <b>she-goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), <b>it interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter and taught that the</b> offering of a <b>she-goat does not require</b> the <b>fat tail</b> to be burned on the altar. |
| Leviticus 3:12 | she-goat” | Pesachim 97a:5 | <b>However, a Paschal lamb in a case like this is sacrificed as a peace-offering, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b>“lamb”</b> comes <b>to include the Paschal lamb</b> in the requirement that <b>the fat tail</b> be sacrificed on the altar. <b>When it says: “If</b> he brings <b>a lamb,”</b> it comes <b>to include</b> a lamb consecrated as <b>a Paschal lamb whose</b> first <b>year has passed and peace-offerings that come due to a Paschal lamb.</b> These are considered peace-offerings rather than Paschal lambs, and they are included <b>in all the laws of peace-offerings</b> in <b>that they require leaning and libations and the waving of the breast and thigh. When it says</b> later: <b>“And if</b> his offering is a <b>she-goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), <b>it interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter</b> of the <i>halakhot</i> of sheep brought as peace-offerings and began a new discussion <b>in order to teach that the</b> offering of a <b>she-goat does not require</b> the <b>fat tail</b> to be offered on the altar. This <i>baraita</i> teaches that an animal consecrated as a Paschal lamb whose first year has passed is offered as a peace-offering and is not left to graze until it develops a blemish. |
| Leviticus 3:12 | a goat” | Zevachim 9a:19 | The Gemara cites another objection. <b>Rav Ḥana of Baghdad objects to this: How can you say that when this</b> verse <b>is written, it is written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering? But from</b> that <b>which is written</b> in the subsequent verses: <b>“If</b> he brings <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and <b>“if</b> his offering is <b>a goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), one learns <b>by inference that</b> the passage is <b>not written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering;</b> the Torah states elsewhere, in Exodus 12:5, that a Paschal offering is brought from both lambs and goats, and it is unnecessary to teach this again in Leviticus. |
| Leviticus 3:13 | “and he shall slaughter it” | Kiddushin 57b:14 | Abaye quotes a lengthy <i>baraita</i> that serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is derived <b>from here:</b> The Torah states <b>three verses that</b> have <b>a superfluous</b> element with regard to the various species from which one may bring a peace-offering: The verse <b>“and he slaughters it”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), and the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). The Torah could simply have stated: “And he shall slaughter,” without adding: “It.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the term “it” these three times? |
| Leviticus 3:13 | but not the hand of his agent; “his hand” | Menachot 93b:4 | § The mishna states: A Canaanite <b>slave, the agent</b> of the owner of the offering who brings the offering on his behalf, <b>and a woman</b> do not place hands on their offerings. Concerning these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term “his hand” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3, which details the requirement of placing hands. Each mention is expounded to exclude a different case. <b>“His hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not the hand of his</b> Canaanite <b>slave; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not the hand of his agent; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not the hand of his wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:13 | “his hand upon the head” | Menachot 93b:9 | § The mishna further states that that placing hands is performed by leaning <b>on the head</b> of the offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase “his hand upon the head” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3. Each mention is expounded to exclude the possibility of performing the rite on a different part of the animal’s body. Placing hands is performed with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the neck</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the back</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the breast</b> of the animal. |
| Leviticus 3:13 | and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 55a:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to cattle peace offerings, the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2). With regard to sheep peace offerings the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:8). With regard to goat peace offerings the verse states: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, <b>and slaughter it before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). |
| Leviticus 3:16 | “All the fat is the Lord’s” | Chullin 117a:5 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said to</b> Rabbi Yannai: <b>Is that</b> derivation <b>that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught unattractive,</b> that you derive a new one? He taught that when the Torah states with regard to peace offerings, which are of lesser sanctity: <b>“All the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16), it serves <b>to include the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity in</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, even though the prohibition is stated explicitly only with regard to offerings of the most sacred order. |
| Leviticus 3:16 | all the fat is the Lord’s” | Keritot 23b:5 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is stated with regard to peace offerings, which are offerings of lesser sanctity: “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing aroma; <b>all the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16). This verse serves <b>to include the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 3:16 | “All the fat is the Lord’s” | Keritot 23b:9 | The Gemara challenges: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>even with regard to sacrificial</b> meat <b>a prohibition does not take effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse: <b>“All the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16), from which it was derived above that the sacrificial parts of offerings of lesser sanctity are included in the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property? |
| Leviticus 3:16 | all the fat is the Lord’s” | Meilah 15a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And by Torah law</b> is there <b>no</b> liability for misuse of items consecrated for sacrifice on the altar? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states at the conclusion of the passage discussing the sacrifice of a peace offering: “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar, it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing aroma; <b>all the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16). The term “all” serves <b>to include the portions of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> as subject <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse.</b> This is a source from the Torah for the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable for misuse of items consecrated for sacrifice on the altar. |
| Leviticus 3:16 | shall burn them | Pesachim 64b:11 | The Gemara answers: <b>He subsequently burned them one by one</b> and not all together. The Gemara asks further: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the plural “them” in the verse: “And the priest <b>shall burn them</b> upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire for a satisfying aroma; all the fat is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 3:16) indicates <b>that all</b> the sacrificial parts of a sacrifice must be offered <b>at the same time? Rather,</b> it must be that when the High Priest took a kidney for counting, it was <b>merely</b> momentary <b>seizure;</b> that is, <b>he took it from them until they brought him something else</b> with which to keep track of the numbers, and it was this other item that was counted afterward. |
| Leviticus 3:16 | all the fat is the Lord’s” | Temurah 32b:5 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states at the conclusion of the passage discussing the sacrifice of a peace offering: “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar…<b>all the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16). The word “all” serves <b>to include the portions of offerings of lesser sanctity in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse;</b> all the more so is it the case that offerings of the most sacred order, e.g., a sin offering or guilt offering, are included. |
| Leviticus 3:17 | to it, | Chullin 120a:17 | The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> one who <b>caused blood to coagulate and ate it</b> is liable. Although blood is not normally eaten in such a manner, <b>since he caused</b> the blood <b>to coagulate, he ascribed</b> the <b>significance</b> of food <b>to it,</b> and the Torah prohibits the eating of blood, as it is written: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). <b>But</b> why is one who <b>melted</b> forbidden <b>fat and swallowed it</b> liable? <b>Eating,</b> and not drinking, <b>is stated</b> in the Torah with regard to the prohibition against the consumption of forbidden fat, as it is written: “You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat” (Leviticus 7:23), <b>and this</b> swallowing of a liquid <b>is not eating.</b> |
| Leviticus 3:17 | from the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood” | Keritot 4a:22 | Accordingly, the prohibition <b>of:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat,”</b> can be derived <b>from the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood”</b> (Leviticus 3:17), <b>which is written with regard to the matter of sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And there are no undomesticated animals in</b> the category of <b>sacrificial</b> animals. <b>So too,</b> with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox,</b> or sheep, or goat,” <b>when</b> the verse <b>writes it without</b> further <b>specification, there is no</b> reason <b>to be uncertain</b> whether or not it is referring also <b>to undomesticated animals. Therefore,</b> the phrase <b>“ox, or sheep, or goat” comes to separate,</b> i.e., <b>to render one liable for</b> eating the forbidden fat of <b>each and every one</b> of them. |
| Leviticus 3:17 | you shall eat neither fat nor blood” | Keritot 4b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, then <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, for what</b> purpose does the verse: “It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that <b>you shall eat neither fat nor blood”</b> (Leviticus 3:17), <b>come?</b> After all, he has already derived the prohibition against eating the forbidden fat of sacrificial animals from the verse: “You shall eat no fat of ox.” The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it to juxtapose</b> the prohibition against consuming blood to the prohibition against eating forbidden fat. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> which teaches that <b>just as</b> for eating forbidden <b>fat</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>so too,</b> for eating <b>blood</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: Only one prohibition applies to</b> blood. |
| Leviticus 3:17 | verses that are written: “It shall be a perpetual statute | Keritot 4b:4 | <b>Rav Sheizevi said to Rava: Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, this is</b> the meaning of the three <b>verses that are written: “It shall be a perpetual statute</b> throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17); <b>“You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23); <b>“And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food”</b> (Leviticus 22:10), as <b>these</b> are <b>three prohibitions,</b> two for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals, as the two verses that mention fat are discussing sacrificial animals, and one for the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of consecrated food. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is their reasoning?</b> Why is one liable to receive only two sets of lashes? |
| Leviticus 3:17 | fat and blood | Kiddushin 37b:11 | The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>dwelling, which the Merciful One writes with regard to</b> the consumption of forbidden <b>fat and blood</b> in the verse: “A perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither forbidden fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17)? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to state this, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since</b> these prohibitions <b>are written in the context of the offerings,</b> then <b>when there is an offering</b> and the priests sacrifice fat and blood upon the altar, i.e., when the Temple is standing, that is when forbidden <b>fat and blood are forbidden</b> for consumption. But <b>when there is no offering,</b> forbidden fat and blood are <b>not</b> forbidden. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they are always forbidden. |
| Leviticus 3:17 | “Eat,” | Yoma 74a:7 | § Apropos the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, the Gemara deals with <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> What is the law with regard to <b>a half-measure? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited by Torah</b> law. <b>Reish Lakish said: It is permitted by Torah</b> law. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said it is prohibited by Torah</b> law <b>because it is fit to combine</b> with another half-measure. If one continues to eat more, he will eat a whole measure, which is punishable by Torah law. Therefore, even when he eats the first half-measure <b>he is eating forbidden</b> food. <b>Reish Lakish said it is permitted by Torah</b> law. His reason is as follows: With regard to all forbidden foods, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“Eat,”</b> for example in the verse: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). Eating is defined as consuming a minimum of an olive-bulk, <b>and there is no</b> prohibition if one eats less than an olive-bulk. |
| Leviticus 3:17 | no fat | Zevachim 70b:9 | <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat</b> nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). The generalization “no fat” indicates that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to the forbidden fats of all domesticated kosher animals, including those from which one is prohibited from deriving benefit. |
| Leviticus 4:2 | As it is taught | Keritot 3a:24 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, and performs from one of them [<i>me’aḥat mehena</i>]” (Leviticus 4:2). The expression “<i>me’aḥat mehena</i>” is interpreted in several ways. One of them is: There is an instance of <b>“them [<i>hena</i>],”</b> i.e., many unwitting transgressions, <b>which is</b> like <b>“one [<i>aḥat</i>],”</b> a single unwitting transgression, in that one is liable to bring only one sin offering. How so? When one performed many labors where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat but</b> his action was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> he brings only one sin offering. That is the case referred to in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 4:2 | the Sages taught | Keritot 4a:28 | § With regard to the sin offering required of one who transgresses the prohibition against eating forbidden fat, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, and from one of them” (Leviticus 4:2). This phrase should be interpreted as though it states: <b>And performs one,</b> and again states: <b>And performs them,</b> i.e., it serves <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression. |
| Leviticus 4:2 | “From one of them” | Sanhedrin 62a:11 | <b>Rav Yosef objects to this: Perhaps Rabbi Yosei says there,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, that <b>kindling</b> a fire <b>was singled out to</b> teach that it is an ordinary <b>prohibition only because he derives the division of labors</b> on Shabbat, i.e., that one is obligated to bring an offering for each category of labor that he violated, <b>from</b> a different verse, namely: <b>“From one of them”</b> (Leviticus 4:2). |
| Leviticus 4:2 | and performs from one of them” | Sanhedrin 62a:12 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> with regard to the verse: “If any one shall sin through error, in any of the things which the Lord has commanded not to be done, <b>and performs from one of them”</b> (Leviticus 4:2), that there are <b>times when</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for all</b> of his transgressions together, <b>and</b> there are <b>times when</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression. |
| Leviticus 4:2 | from one | Shabbat 103a:12 | <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “When a leader sinned, <b>and he</b> unwittingly <b>performed one</b> of any of the commandments which the Lord his God commanded not to do, and is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22)? The Sages taught: I <b>might</b> have thought that one is not guilty until he performs a complete labor, e.g., <b>until he writes the entire name</b> that he intended to write, <b>or until he weaves the entire garment, or until he crafts the entire sieve</b> made from the reeds of the warp and the woof; therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A soul who sins unintentionally in any of the Lord’s commandments which one shall not perform, and did an action <b>from one</b> of these” (Leviticus 4:2). |
| Leviticus 4:2 | Rabbi Yosei says | Shabbat 103b:4 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the verse states: “And did an action from one of these” (Leviticus 4:2). This unusual expression indicates repetition: <b>And he performed one, and he performed these.</b> From here it is derived that <b>at times one is liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for them all, and at times one is liable</b> to bring several offerings, one <b>for each and every one.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:2 | and performs from one of them [ me’aḥat me’hena ]” | Shabbat 70a:6 | The Gemara raises an additional challenge to Shmuel’s opinion. If he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei with regard to the explicit prohibition of kindling, <b>let him derive the division of labors from where Rabbi Yosei derives it. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says,</b> it is stated: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, <b>and performs from one of them [<i>me’aḥat me’hena</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 4:2). Rabbi Yosei interprets the verse that <b>at times one is liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for all</b> of his transgressions, <b>and at times one is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei?</b> He interprets the unique phrase employed in that verse: From one of these. The Torah could have merely stated: <b>One [<i>aḥat</i>].</b> Instead, it stated: <b>From one [<i>me’aḥat</i>].</b> It could have merely stated: <b>Them [<i>hena</i>].</b> Instead, it stated: <b>Of them [<i>me’hena</i>].</b> Rabbi Yosei derives that there are cases of <b>one</b> transgression <b>that,</b> with regard to punishment, <b>are them,</b> i.e., many. And there are cases of <b>them,</b> several transgressions, <b>that,</b> with regard to punishment, <b>are one.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:2 | states: “If an individual person shall transgress [ teḥeta ] unwittingly” | Shevuot 12b:7 | The Gemara answers: They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the High Priest sacrificing the internal goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16). The verse is referring to two categories of sin. The first category is <b>acts of rebellion [<i>pesha’im</i>]; these are the rebellious sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that King Jehoram of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: <b>“The king of Moab rebelled [<i>pasha</i>] against me”</b> (II Kings 3:7). <b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to a rebellion against Judah: <b>“Then Libnah rebelled [<i>tifsha</i>] at that time”</b> (II Kings 8:22). The second category is <b>sins [<i>ḥataot</i>]; these are unwitting sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “If an individual person shall transgress [<i>teḥeta</i>] unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:2). |
| Leviticus 4:2 | All of their sins, these are unwitting sins. And it says: “If a soul should sin unwittingly” | Yoma 36b:6 | <b>Rebellions are rebellious</b> transgressions, when one not only intends to violate a prohibition but does so as an act of defiance against God. <b>And likewise, it says: “The king of Moab rebelled [<i>pasha</i>] against me”</b> (II Kings 3:7). <b>And it is said: “Then Livna rebelled at that time”</b> (II Kings 8:22). With regard to the phrase: <b>All of their sins, these are unwitting sins. And it says: “If a soul should sin unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:2). In light of these definitions the sequence suggested by Rabbi Meir is unlikely, as <b>once he confessed the wrongdoings and rebellions,</b> does <b>he then confess the unwitting</b> sins? |
| Leviticus 4:3 | the verse states: “If the anointed priest shall sin” | Horayot 10a:13 | § Apropos a king, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In contrast to other cases where the verse states: If he will sin, it states concerning a king: <b>“When [<i>asher</i>] a king sins.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this is <b>a decree,</b> i.e., that it is a given that the king will sin. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If the anointed priest shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:3). <b>Just as there</b> the meaning is: <b>In the event that</b> the priest <b>shall sin, so too here,</b> the meaning is: <b>In the event that</b> the king <b>shall sin.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | “And he shall sacrifice for his sin [ ḥattato ] | Horayot 10a:2 | § With regard to the statement in the mishna concerning an anointed priest who sinned after he was removed from his position, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> It is written with regard to the High Priest: <b>“And he shall sacrifice for his sin [<i>ḥattato</i>]</b> that he sinned” (Leviticus 4:3); this <b>teaches that he brings his sin-offering [<i>ḥattato</i>]</b> even <b>after he has moved on</b> from his priesthood. |
| Leviticus 4:3 | “If the anointed priest shall sin to bring guilt” | Horayot 10a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If a king or High Priest sinned before they were appointed, and thereafter they were appointed, the status of these people is like that of commoners. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If the anointed priest shall sin to bring guilt”</b> (Leviticus 4:3); this serves to <b>exclude the</b> unwitting transgressions he performed <b>prior</b> to his installation as High Priest. |
| Leviticus 4:3 | is different, as the verse altered its formulation; | Horayot 10b:3 | <b>Rava, son of Rabba, objects to this: If that is so,</b> and the term <i>asher</i> is interpreted in that manner, then concerning that <b>which is written: “And he shall pay for that which [<i>asher</i>] he has sinned from the sacred item”</b> (Leviticus 5:16), <b>and with regard to Jeroboam, son of Nevat, about whom it is written: “Who [<i>asher</i>] sinned and caused others to sin”</b> (I Kings 14:16), <b>so too</b> is the interpretation <b>that this generation is happy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in the case of a king who brings an offering, it <b>is different, as the verse altered its formulation;</b> in parallel verses, the term “if” is utilized, e.g., in the verse: “If the anointed priest shall sin” (Leviticus 4:3). In the other instances, <i>asher</i> is the standard formulation. |
| Leviticus 4:3 | so as to bring guilt upon the people” | Horayot 6b:14 | § The mishna teaches: If he issued the ruling unwittingly, and performed the transgression intentionally, or if he issued the ruling <b>intentionally and performed</b> the transgression <b>unwittingly,</b> he is exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> unique to the sin-offering for an unwitting transgression by the anointed priest, derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), from which it is derived that the liability of the <b>anointed</b> priest <b>is</b> incurred <b>like</b> that of the general <b>public.</b> The Gemara discusses this derivation. <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the verse is superfluous: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference?</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | for his sin that he has sinned” | Horayot 7a:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since he does not achieve atonement with the</b> general <b>public on Yom Kippur,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he will bring a bull for himself</b> even if he unwittingly performed a transgression with the general public. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Then he shall offer <b>for his sin that he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that he sinned alone, not with the general public. <b>How so?</b> If <b>he sinned by himself he brings</b> his sin-offering of a bull <b>by himself;</b> if <b>he sinned with the</b> general <b>public, he achieves atonement with the</b> general <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | so as to bring guilt upon the people” | Horayot 7a:5 | Since either conclusion can be derived logically, another source is necessary. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that the status of the <b>anointed</b> priest <b>is like</b> that of the general <b>public.</b> Therefore, <b>just as</b> the general <b>public brings</b> an offering <b>only for absence</b> of awareness <b>of</b> the <b>matter</b> by the court <b>with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action</b> by the people, <b>so too, an anointed</b> priest <b>brings</b> an offering <b>only for absence</b> of awareness <b>of</b> the <b>matter with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | “Then he shall offer for his sin that he has sinned” | Horayot 7a:6 | The Gemara challenges the comparison: Based on the comparison between the anointed priest and the general public, why not <b>say: Just as</b> with regard to the general <b>public,</b> if the court <b>issued a ruling and</b> the general public <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>after its</b> ruling and <b>in accordance with its ruling,</b> the court is <b>liable, so too,</b> with regard to <b>an anointed</b> priest, <b>when he issued a ruling and</b> the general public <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>after his</b> ruling and <b>in accordance with his ruling, he should be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the anointed priest: <b>“Then he shall offer for his sin that he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), from which it is derived: <b>He brings</b> an offering <b>for that</b> sin <b>that he sinned</b> on the basis of his ruling, <b>but he does not bring</b> an offering <b>for that</b> sin <b>that others sinned</b> on the basis of his ruling. |
| Leviticus 4:3 | “So as to bring guilt upon the people” | Horayot 7a:8 | The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the guilt-offering: <b>“And the priest shall atone for him for his unwitting act that he performed unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 5:18), from which it is derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>one whose transgression and his unwitting</b> action <b>are equal,</b> i.e., an ordinary person, whose unwitting act is the very transgression that he performed unwittingly. This serves to <b>exclude an anointed</b> priest, <b>whose unwitting</b> action <b>and his transgression are not equal,</b> as his unwitting act is the erroneous ruling and he is liable to bring an offering only if he performed the transgression on the basis of that ruling. <b>As it is written</b> about the anointed priest: <b>“So as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that the status of the <b>anointed</b> priest <b>is like</b> that of the general <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | so as to bring guilt upon the people” | Horayot 7b:12 | The mishna continues: <b>And likewise the anointed</b> priest. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the anointed priest: “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that the status of <b>an anointed</b> priest <b>is like</b> that of the general <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | so as to bring guilt upon the people” | Horayot 7b:7 | The mishna teaches: <b>And likewise</b> with regard to the ruling of <b>the anointed</b> priest. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that the status of <b>an anointed</b> priest <b>is like</b> that of the general <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | so as to bring guilt upon the people” | Horayot 8a:7 | <b>We found</b> a source for the court bringing an offering for a transgression of the general <b>public</b> based on their erroneous ruling. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is the <i>halakha</i> for <b>an anointed</b> priest? The Gemara answers: It is derived from the verse: “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that the status of <b>an anointed</b> priest <b>is like</b> that of the transgression of the general <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:3 | as it is taught | Megillah 9b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “If the anointed priest shall sin” (Leviticus 4:3). From the word <b>anointed, I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to a High Priest who was actually <b>anointed with the oil of anointing. From where</b> do I derive that even a High Priest consecrated by donning the <b>multiple garments</b> is also included in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “The anointed,”</b> with the definite article, indicating that the <i>halakha</i> applies to every High Priest. |
| Leviticus 4:3 | so as to bring guilt on the people” | Yevamot 9a:4 | The Gemara continues: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the offering brought by the community is a sin-offering; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>an anointed</b> High Priest also brings a sin-offering for this transgression? <b>As it is written</b> with regard <b>to an anointed</b> High Priest: “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt on the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), which indicates that <b>an anointed</b> High Priest brings an offering <b>like the community.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:5 | shall take from the blood of the bull” | Bekhorot 39b:1 | <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>one who slits the ear of the bull</b> with the knife after slaughter, creating a blemish, <b>and thereafter collects its blood</b> from the neck, the offering is <b>disqualified, as it is stated: “And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:5). By using the term “the bull,” the verse indicates that the <b>bull</b> must be at the time of collection of the blood as <b>it already was</b> before slaughter, without a blemish. <b>Rather, here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney <b>before the collection</b> of the blood, whereas <b>there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is dealing with a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney only <b>after the collection</b> of the blood. |
| Leviticus 4:5 | shall take from the blood of the bull” | Yoma 48a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a halakhic midrash: <b>“And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:5); this means that the priest shall take <b>from the blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the bull’s blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies, <b>and not from the blood of the skin,</b> which bleeds out when the skin is cut before the slaughter, <b>nor from the blood squeezed</b> from an animal after the initial spurt. |
| Leviticus 4:5 | “And the anointed priest shall take from the blood of the bull [ middam happar ]” | Zevachim 25a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the anointed priest shall take from the blood of the bull [<i>middam happar</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 4:5). This means that the priest shall take <b>from the blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies, <b>but not from the blood of the skin,</b> which bleeds out when the skin is cut before the slaughter, <b>nor from the blood of exudate,</b> i.e., that exudes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of its slaughter concludes. |
| Leviticus 4:5 | shall take from the blood of the bull” | Zevachim 25b:13 | § <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> In the case of <b>one who slits the ear of the bull</b> with the knife after slaughter, creating a blemish, <b>and thereafter collected its blood</b> from the neck, the offering is <b>disqualified, as it is stated: “And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:5). By referring to the animal as a bull even after its slaughter, the verse indicates that the <b>bull</b> must be at the time of collection of the blood as <b>it already was</b> before slaughter, without a blemish. |
| Leviticus 4:5 | shall take from the blood of the bull” | Zevachim 26a:3 | The Gemara challenges: If he <b>severed</b> its legs <b>and thereafter collected</b> the blood, is the offering <b>fit? But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say:</b> If one <b>slits the ear of a firstborn</b> animal with the knife after slaughter, creating a blemish, <b>and thereafter collected its blood</b> from the neck, the offering is <b>disqualified, as it is stated: “And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:5)? The verse indicates that the <b>bull</b> must be at the time of collection of the blood as <b>it already was</b> before slaughter, without a blemish. |
| Leviticus 4:6 | and sprinkle | Menachot 21a:12 | Rava <b>said</b> to him: <b>You have reminded me of a matter, as Rabbi Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>blood that became congealed,</b> if it is blood <b>of the</b> external <b>sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take</b> of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, <b>and place it</b> upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25), and congealed blood <b>is suitable for taking and placing,</b> as one can take the congealed blood and place it upon the altar. By contrast, if it is blood <b>of the inner sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger in the blood, <b>and sprinkle</b> of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and this</b> congealed blood <b>is not suitable for dipping and sprinkling.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:6 | inside | Menachot 27b:3 | <b>But</b> with regard to the sprinkling of the blood <b>that</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, of inner sin offerings, the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, the blood of the bull of the anointed priest, the blood of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and the blood of the goats of idol worship, which are to be sprinkled “before the Lord, in front of the Curtain of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and</b> the sprinkling of the oil <b>that</b> takes place during the purification <b>of the leper,</b> which is done “seven times before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), if these are performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>they are not valid.</b> But if they are performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the direction where they should be sprinkled, <b>they are valid.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:6 | the anointed priest. | Menachot 7b:10 | The Gemara continues: <b>And it was stated</b> with regard to this dilemma: <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even in</b> the case of the <b>blood, one has not sanctified</b> it if he collected less than a full measure of blood in a single vessel. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is also taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the bull of <b>the anointed priest.</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6). From the term <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip”</b> it is derived that there must be enough blood inside the vessel in which to dip his finger, <b>and</b> there should <b>not</b> be so little blood that he must resort to <b>wiping</b> his finger along the walls of the vessel. |
| Leviticus 4:6 | in the blood” | Menachot 7b:9 | The Gemara explains the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps, there,</b> in the case of the water of purification, <b>what is the reason</b> that it is not sanctified? It is possible that the reason is <b>that it is written</b> in a verse that is referring to the water initially placed in the vessel: <b>“And dip it in the water”</b> (Numbers 19:18). If this verse is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the hyssop may be dipped in the water of purification only when there was initially enough water in the vessel for sprinkling, then <b>here too,</b> in the case of the blood of a sin offering, <b>isn’t it written: “And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger <b>in the blood”</b> (Leviticus 4:6)? |
| Leviticus 4:6 | shall dip | Zevachim 14a:3 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that one cannot render the offering <i>piggul</i> while dipping his finger in the blood of <b>the external sin offerings?</b> The statement: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger in the blood” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>is not written with regard to</b> these offerings. Since it is clearly not an essential rite, why was it necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that improper intent while performing it cannot render the offering <i>piggul</i>? |
| Leviticus 4:6 | “And sprinkle | Zevachim 15a:13 | This is <b>as Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the priest <b>was sprinkling</b> the blood, <b>and the hand of the one sprinkling was severed before</b> the <b>blood reached the airspace of the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the sprinkling not valid since it was performed by a blemished priest, or is it valid because the blood left the bird before he was blemished? <b>And</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>not valid. What is the reason? We require</b> that the verse: <b>“And sprinkle</b> of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6), be fulfilled in the same manner as the verse that follows it: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>place</b> of the blood upon the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 4:7), namely, that the blood reach the altar. Therefore, the blood can be disqualified anytime until it reaches the altar, whether through the priest becoming blemished or through prohibited intent. |
| Leviticus 4:6 | is necessary only to | Zevachim 40a:15 | <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This reference to the bull of Yom Kippur in the term “with the bull,” <b>is necessary only to</b> apply to the bull of Yom Kippur three <i>halakhot</i> that are derived from that which is stated with regard to the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest: “And the priest shall immerse his finger [<i>et etzba’o</i>] in the blood” (Leviticus 4:6). These <i>halakhot</i> can be summarized in the shortened form: <b><i>Et</i>, blood, and with immersion.</b> The Gemara elaborates: With regard to the word <b><i>et</i>, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says:</b> This word <b>is necessary only to render fit</b> |
| Leviticus 4:6 | “in the blood” | Zevachim 40b:1 | service performed by a priest who has <b>a wart</b> or blister <b>on</b> his <b>finger.</b> These are not considered an interposition between his finger and the blood. With regard to the term <b>“in the blood”</b> (Leviticus 4:6), this teaches <b>that the blood</b> in the service vessel <b>must be of a</b> sufficient <b>measure for immersion from the outset.</b> The priest must initially collect in the vessel enough blood for all the sprinklings, rather than adding blood to the vessel for each sprinkling. Finally, the term <b>“and</b> the priest <b>shall immerse</b> his finger in the blood” indicates that there must be enough blood in the vessel such that the priest can immerse his finger in it <b>and not</b> have to <b>wipe</b> the sides of the utensil to collect blood for sprinkling. |
| Leviticus 4:6 | the Curtain of the Sanctuary” | Zevachim 41b:4 | <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> further <b>taught: For what</b> reason <b>is it stated:</b> “Before <b>the Curtain of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 4:6), <b>with regard to the bull</b> for an unwitting sin <b>of the anointed priest, and</b> this <b>is not stated with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> where it merely states: “Before the Curtain” (Leviticus 4:17)? This can be explained by <b>a parable:</b> It can be compared <b>to a flesh-and-blood king against whom a province sinned. If a minority of</b> that province <b>sinned,</b> his relationship with <b>his entourage [<i>pamalya</i>] remains,</b> i.e., the king continues to treat his loyal followers in the usual manner. But <b>if the majority of</b> the province <b>sinned,</b> his relationship with <b>his entourage does not remain,</b> and he no longer meets even those who remained devoted to him. Similarly, when the entire people sins, God no longer has the same relationship with them, and it is as though the place where the priest sprinkles the blood is no longer sacred. |
| Leviticus 4:6 | in the blood, | Zevachim 93b:5 | <b>Or, perhaps: What is the reason there,</b> that the combined water of purification is not fit for sprinkling? It may be <b>because it is written</b> about sprinkling the water: <b>“And dip it in the water”</b> (Numbers 19:18), stressing that it is to be dipped in precisely the same water that was first placed in the vessel. This indicates that from the outset there must be an amount sufficient for sprinkling. If so, then <b>here also</b> there is comparable language employed with regard to the blood of a sin offering. <b>It is written: “And</b> the priest shall <b>dip</b> his finger <b>in the blood,</b> and sprinkle of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6). Does this prove that from the outset there must be sufficient blood for sprinkling? |
| Leviticus 4:6 | shall dip | Zevachim 93b:7 | § <b>Rava says: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the internal sin offering, whose blood is sprinkled in the Sanctuary: The verse states: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6); <b>and</b> there must be enough blood in the vessel for the priest to dip his finger in it so that he does <b>not</b> need to <b>wipe</b> blood from the sides or the bottom of the vessel onto his finger. The verse states: <b>“In the blood,”</b> teaching that the blood is unfit for sprinkling <b>unless there is a measure of the blood</b> fit for <b>dipping</b> in the vessel <b>from the outset,</b> and the blood is disqualified if more blood is added to a vessel that initially contained less than the required measure. The verse states: “Sprinkle <b>of the blood,”</b> which teaches that he must sprinkle <b>of the blood that is</b> mentioned <b>in</b> this <b>matter,</b> which is the blood in the vessel. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | at the base of the altar of the burnt-offering, | Pesachim 65a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive with respect to <b>the burnt-offering itself</b> that its blood must be sprinkled on the altar in a place where there is a base? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse said:</b> “And he shall pour all the blood of the bull <b>at the base of the altar of the burnt-offering,</b> which is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>Apparently,</b> the blood of <b>a burnt-offering requires</b> sprinkling at <b>the base,</b> as the verse specifically links the base of the altar to the burnt-offering. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out on the base of the altar” | Yoma 48a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> interprets the phrase <b>“from the blood of the bull,”</b> as though these words were written in a different order: <b>Blood from the bull,</b> i.e., the priest shall <b>receive it</b> directly. <b>For if it should enter your mind</b> that the letter <i>mem</i>, which means “from” in the phrase <b>“from the blood of the bull,”</b> is limiting <b>and</b> indicates that <b>even</b> if the priest received <b>some of the blood,</b> his action is acceptable, <b>didn’t Rav Yehuda say: He who receives</b> the blood <b>must receive all of the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out on the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:7)? This verse emphasizes that the priest must pour all of the bull’s blood, which is possible only if he has collected all of it. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out on the base of the altar” | Yoma 56b:10 | <b>And if you say</b> that <b>he does not collect all</b> the bull’s blood but only some of it, so that the bowls are of equal size, <b>didn’t Rav Yehuda say: One who slaughters</b> the bull <b>must receive all of the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out on the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:7). |
| Leviticus 4:7 | altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting” | Yoma 58b:7 | Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall put the blood upon the corners of the <b>altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 4:7). This verse teaches that the <b>altar</b> is <b>before the Lord, but the priest is not before the Lord. How so?</b> The priest <b>stands on the outer side of the altar and sprinkles.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:7 | “And he shall pour out all the blood of the bull | Yoma 59a:13 | § The mishna taught: <b>And he would pour the remainder of the blood on the western base of the outer altar.</b> The Gemara explains: The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to the sin-offering bull of the High Priest during the rest of the year: <b>“And he shall pour out all the blood of the bull</b> at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7), <b>and when he goes out</b> from the Sanctuary to pour the remainder of the blood, <b>he first reaches that</b> western side of the base of the altar. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | place | Zevachim 15a:13 | This is <b>as Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the priest <b>was sprinkling</b> the blood, <b>and the hand of the one sprinkling was severed before</b> the <b>blood reached the airspace of the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the sprinkling not valid since it was performed by a blemished priest, or is it valid because the blood left the bird before he was blemished? <b>And</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>not valid. What is the reason? We require</b> that the verse: <b>“And sprinkle</b> of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6), be fulfilled in the same manner as the verse that follows it: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>place</b> of the blood upon the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 4:7), namely, that the blood reach the altar. Therefore, the blood can be disqualified anytime until it reaches the altar, whether through the priest becoming blemished or through prohibited intent. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out | Zevachim 25a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: When the verse states: <b>“From the blood of the bull,”</b> it should be interpreted as if it is written: <b>He shall collect the blood from the bull,</b> i.e., if the blood spills onto the floor before it is collected in a service vessel, it is disqualified. <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>“from the blood of the bull”</b> should be interpreted <b>as it is written,</b> i.e., that <b>“from the blood”</b> means that the priest may collect <b>even</b> only <b>a portion of the blood,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rav say: One who slaughters</b> the offering <b>must collect all the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out</b> on the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:7)? The verse emphasizes that the priest must pour all the blood of the bull, which is possible only if he has collected all of it. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | the altar of sweet incense | Zevachim 40b:4 | The Gemara addresses another apparently superfluous phrase in the same chapter: “And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the corners of <b>the altar of sweet incense</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to mention the sweet incense? It would have been enough to identify the altar as being “before the Lord” and one would have understood that the reference is to the inner altar. Rather, this serves to teach <b>that if the altar had not been inaugurated with sweet incense,</b> the priest <b>would not sprinkle</b> blood on it. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 51a:13 | § The mishna teaches with regard to the sin offerings whose blood is presented inside the Sanctuary: As to <b>the remainder of the blood</b> which is left after the sprinklings, a priest would pour it onto the western base of the external altar. But if he did not place the remainder of the blood on the western base, it does not disqualify the offering. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that it must be poured on the western base? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the bull offering of the High Priest: “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the corners of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting; and all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out <b>at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 4:7). This means that he must pour it on <b>that</b> base <b>which he encounters first</b> when he leaves the Tent of Meeting, which is the western base. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | at the base of the altar of burnt offering” | Zevachim 51a:14 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are three verses that contain the same phrase. With regard to pouring the remainder of the blood of a bull offering of the High Priest, the verse states: “All the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out <b>at the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:7). This teaches that it must be on the base of the external altar, <b>but not</b> on <b>the base of the inner altar,</b> where he had sprinkled the blood. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | and all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour | Zevachim 52a:13 | If so, the verse that states that there is a requirement that the blood of the sin offering of a High Priest is poured on the base of the altar is apparently superfluous. One <b>might</b> have thought that the reason the Torah writes it is to teach that failure to pour the blood there <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle of the blood upon the corners of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting, <b>and all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour</b> out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). |
| Leviticus 4:7 | he shall pour out | Zevachim 52a:8 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa</b> that even Rabbi Yishmael agrees that failure to pour the remainder of the blood on the base does not disqualify the offering. The verse states: “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the corners of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting; <b>and all the remaining blood</b> of the bull <b>he shall pour out</b> at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “of the bull”?</b> This seems superfluous, as the entire passage is referring to the bull. This serves to <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> another bull, i.e., <b>the bull of Yom Kippur, which</b> also <b>requires placement of blood on the base</b> of the external altar. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | to his exit from the Sanctuary | Zevachim 53a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>And</b> one can <b>derive</b> the meaning of this <b>unspecified</b> phrase <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>the explicit</b> phrase, as follows: <b>You said</b> that one can <b>derive</b> the location of the priest’s <b>descent from the ramp</b> of the external altar after sprinkling blood of the sin offering by comparing it <b>to his exit from the Sanctuary</b> with the blood that remained after having sprinkled blood inside the Sanctuary. The verse states with regard to the bull offering of the High Priest: “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>Just as</b> upon <b>his exit from the Sanctuary</b> the priest pours the remainder of the blood <b>on</b> the side <b>closest to him,</b> the western side, <b>so too,</b> upon <b>his descent from the ramp</b> of the external altar after sprinkling blood from the sin offering, he pours the blood <b>on</b> the side <b>closest to him,</b> which is the southern side. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | altar stands in the north | Zevachim 53a:14 | <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the blood is poured on the <b>southern base</b> of the altar, <b>what is the reason? Rabbi Asi said: This <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>the entire</b> external <b>altar stands in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the southern base is in the center of the courtyard, opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary. This is what the verse is referring to when it states: “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). The Gemara presents <b>another formulation</b> of Rabbi Asi’s explanation: <b>The entire entrance</b> of the Sanctuary <b>stands in the south</b> of the altar. Accordingly, when the priest exits the Sanctuary the southern base is the first one he encounters. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | at the base of the altar of the burnt offering” | Zevachim 57a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a burnt offering itself</b> has its blood presented on the altar in a place where there is a base? The Gemara answers: We derive it from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And he shall pour all the blood of the bull <b>at the base of the altar of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:7). This <b>teaches that</b> the blood of <b>an obligatory burnt offering requires</b> presentation at the <b>base</b> of the altar, as the verse specifically describes the base of the altar as connected to the burnt offering. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 58b:3 | The Gemara clarifies: With regard to the statement concerning <b>any</b> sacrificial item <b>that is taken</b> from the altar located <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary in order <b>to be placed</b> on the altar <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>what are these</b> items? <b>If we say</b> they are the <b>remaining</b> blood of the sin offerings whose blood is presented on the inner altar, there is no reason for Rabbi Yosei to formulate his principle, as <b>it is explicitly written concerning them:</b> “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out <b>at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 4:7). This verse describes how the blood of the inner sin offerings that remained after the sprinkling was to be poured out on the base of the west side of the altar, which is the side closest to the entrance to the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 4:7 | as it is written: “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar” | Zevachim 64a:3 | The source for <b>bringing</b> meal offerings <b>near</b> the altar at the southwest corner is derived from that <b>which is written: “And he shall bring it to the front of the altar.”</b> The source for pouring <b>the remaining blood</b> at the southwest corner of the altar is <b>as it is written: “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:7), which the Gemara derives to be referring to the southwest corner (see 53a). |
| Leviticus 4:10 | “As it is taken off from the bull of the peace offering” | Chullin 117a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> According to the mishna, one who consumes forbidden fat of an offering is liable for misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> They are derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> that the sacrificial portions of a bull brought for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest must be burned upon the altar: <b>“As it is taken off from the bull of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:10). <b>But what, then, do we learn from the bull of the peace offering?</b> Everything that is specified with regard to a peace offering is stated with regard to this bull as well (see Leviticus 4:8–9). |
| Leviticus 4:10 | “As it is taken off from the bull of the peace offering” | Zevachim 44b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? The verse states with regard to the sacrificial portions of a bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest, which is one of the bulls that are burned: <b>“As it is taken off from the bull of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:10). <b>But what, then, do we learn from the bull of a peace offering?</b> Everything that is specified with regard to a peace offering is stated with regard to this bull as well. |
| Leviticus 4:10 | “As it is taken off | Zevachim 49b:11 | <b>For this</b> reason it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“As it is taken off</b> from the ox” (Leviticus 4:10), so <b>that it is as though it wrote</b> explicitly <b>in</b> the passage discussing the bull for an unwitting communal sin <b>itself.</b> One of the hermeneutical principles applied to understanding verses in the Torah is: If the <i>halakha</i> stated is not required for the matter in which it is written, apply it to another matter. When this principle is employed, the <i>halakha</i> written in one context is viewed as if it were written elsewhere. In this case, as it was not necessary for the verse to write the juxtaposition to a peace offering in the context of the sin offering brought by the High Priest, it is applied to the case of the bull for an unwitting communal sin. <b>And</b> therefore it <b>will not be</b> a case of <b>a matter derived via a juxtaposition</b> that <b>then teaches</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>via a juxtaposition.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:11 | skin and flesh and dung | Yoma 67b:16 | It was taught in the mishna that the High Priest <b>interwove</b> and bound the bull and the goat together <b>into braids</b> as one mass before taking them to be burned. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He made them <b>like a braid,</b> whose parts are interwoven. <b>It was taught: He would not dissect</b> the bull and goat in the manner of the <b>dissection of the flesh of a burnt-offering,</b> where the animal is skinned and then cut into parts. <b>Rather,</b> he would leave the <b>skin on top of the flesh</b> and would cut the animal into pieces without skinning it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is stated here</b> with regard to the bull and goat, <b>skin and flesh and dung</b> (Leviticus 16:27), <b>and it is stated below,</b> with regard to the bull sin-offerings that are burned, <b>skin and flesh and dung</b> (Leviticus 4:11). |
| Leviticus 4:11 | the verse states: “And its innards and its dung” | Zevachim 50a:17 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>If</b> these are compared, one could say that <b>just as there,</b> the burnt offering is prepared for being burned <b>by</b> first <b>flaying</b> it, <b>so too here,</b> the bull offering of a High Priest should <b>also</b> be prepared for being burned <b>by</b> first <b>flaying</b> it. To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states: “And its innards and its dung”</b> (Leviticus 4:11). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> How do these words teach that there is no requirement to flay the animal? <b>Rav Pappa says: Just as the dung</b> remains <b>inside</b> the animal when the animal is burned, <b>so</b> the animal’s <b>flesh</b> remains <b>inside its skin.</b> In any event, the <i>halakha</i> that the bull offering of a High Priest is cut into pieces before it is burned is derived via a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 4:11 | skin, flesh, and dung, | Zevachim 50b:1 | <b>And it is stated below,</b> with regard to the bull sin offerings that are burned, the terms <b>skin, flesh, and dung,</b> in the verse: “But the skin of the bull, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its innards, and its dung” (Leviticus 4:11). <b>Just as below</b> it is prepared for burning <b>by means of cutting</b> it into pieces but <b>not by means of flaying,</b> as derived by the verbal analogy, <b>so too here</b> it is prepared for burning <b>by means of cutting</b> it into pieces but <b>not by means of flaying.</b> Evidently, a <i>halakha</i> derived via a verbal analogy can then teach another <i>halakha</i> via a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | which it is written: “And he shall burn it on wood in fire, | Pesachim 75a:18 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> Is it true that <b>anywhere that it is written: “In fire she shall be burned”</b> it comes <b>to include all</b> methods of <b>burning that come from fire? But</b> what of <b>bulls that are burned,</b> about <b>which it is written: “And he shall burn it on wood in fire,</b> where the ash is poured it shall be burned” (Leviticus 4:12), <b>and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In fire, and not in burning lime and not in burning plaster?</b> Why aren’t all methods of burning permitted in this case as well? |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “Where the ash is poured it shall be burned” | Pesachim 75b:1 | <b>“Where the ash is poured it shall be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). The Gemara responds: <b>Say: That</b> usage of the expression <b>“it shall be burned” is needed for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It shall be burned even though there is no ash there,</b> as the presence of ash from the altar is not essential for burning the bulls. <b>“It shall be burned”</b> also teaches that <b>although the fire has consumed most of it,</b> that is not sufficient. One must take care to complete the burning process. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “outside the camp” | Sanhedrin 42b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that the stoning is carried out outside the three camps? <b>As the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Take out him who has cursed to outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 24:14). This means: <b>Outside</b> the <b>three camps,</b> i.e., even outside the camp of the Israelites. Do <b>you say</b> that he is taken <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, or</b> is he perhaps taken <b>outside only one camp?</b> Proof is brought that he must be taken outside the three camps: <b>It is stated here</b> that the condemned man is taken <b>“outside the camp” and it is stated with regard to the bulls</b> brought as sin-offerings <b>that are burned</b> that they must be burned <b>“outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). <b>Just as there,</b> the bulls brought as sin-offerings are burned when <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, so too here,</b> the condemned man is taken <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp | Sanhedrin 42b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to the bulls brought as sin-offerings that are burned, <b>from where do we</b> derive that they must be burned when outside all three camps? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated about the bull brought as a sin-offering of the High Priest: <b>“Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp</b> unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it” (Leviticus 4:12), meaning that he should take it <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps. Do you say</b> that he takes it <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, or</b> is he required to take it <b>outside only one camp?</b> |
| Leviticus 4:12 | where the ashes are poured out | Sanhedrin 42b:8 | <b>And when</b> another verse <b>states with regard to</b> the removal of <b>the ash:</b> “And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes <b>outside the camp</b> to a clean place” (Leviticus 6:4), that verse also requires an explanation, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated</b> with regard to the bull brought as a sin-offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out</b> shall it be burned” (Leviticus 4:12). The repetition of “outside the camp” indicates that he is required <b>to give it a third camp,</b> i.e., teaching that it is burned when outside the Israelite camp, corresponding to the land outside Jerusalem’s walls. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa raised an objection to Rabbi Ami: “And he shall remove the entire bull | Yoma 50a:1 | § <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa raised an objection to Rabbi Ami: “And he shall remove the entire bull</b> outside the camp” (Leviticus 4:12). This verse speaks of a bull that has been slaughtered and its fats and sacrificial parts have been burned, which proves that even after it has been slaughtered, it is still called a bull. Rabbi Ami replied: The animal itself is not called a bull at this stage; rather, it means <b>that he should remove the entire</b> carcass, all that remains of the bull. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside | Yoma 68a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to other bull sin-offerings that are burned, <b>from where do we</b> derive that they are removed from all three camps? The Gemara explains: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated about the bull sin-offering of the High Priest: <b>“Even the whole bull shall he carry outside</b> the camp…and burn it” (Leviticus 4:12), meaning that he should take it <b>outside of three camps.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:12 | where the ashes are poured out | Yoma 68a:8 | <b>And when it says: “Outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 6:4) with regard to removal of the <b>ash,</b> that verse also requires explanation, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it was already stated</b> with regard to the bull sin-offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out</b> shall it be burned” (Leviticus 4:12). Rather the repetition of the words: Outside the camp, indicates that he should <b>give it a third camp,</b> so that it is burned outside of the Israelite camp as well. Consequently, it has been derived that inner sin-offerings are burned outside of the three camps, and when the Torah states: Outside the camp, with regard to the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, it teaches that as soon as they are taken outside the Temple courtyard, the garments of those carrying them are rendered impure. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “Where the ashes are poured out [ shefekh hadeshen ] shall it be burned” | Yoma 68b:2 | <b>Rava said: Who is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Yosei</b> on this issue? <b>It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Where the ashes are poured out [<i>shefekh hadeshen</i>] shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12), which means <b>that there shall</b> already <b>be ash there</b> in that place, so that it is known as the ash heap even before this animal is burned there. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> This verse indicates <b>that its place should be slanted [<i>meshupakh</i>]</b> so that ash that is deposited there will roll downhill. Rava understood that whereas Rabbi Yosei requires that there already be ash present when the bull is burned, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov does not. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp | Zevachim 105b:14 | The Gemara explains further: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> that the bulls and goats are burned outside the three camps? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated about the bull brought as a sin offering of the High Priest: <b>“Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp</b> unto a pure place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it” (Leviticus 4:12), meaning that he should take it <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps. Do you say</b> that he takes it <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, or</b> is he required to take it outside <b>only one camp?</b> |
| Leviticus 4:12 | where the ashes are poured out shall it be burned” | Zevachim 105b:16 | And <b>when</b> another verse <b>states with regard to</b> the removal of <b>the ash:</b> “And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes <b>outside the camp</b> to a pure place” (Leviticus 6:4), that verse also requires an explanation, <b>as there is no need</b> for the verse <b>to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated</b> with regard to the bull brought as a sin offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a pure place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). The repetition of “outside the camp” indicates that he is required <b>to give it a third camp,</b> i.e., teaching that it is burned when outside the Israelite camp, corresponding to the land outside the walls of Jerusalem. |
| Leviticus 4:12 | “Where the ashes are poured out [ shefekh hadeshen ] shall it be burned” | Zevachim 106a:3 | <b>Rava said: Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to bulls that are burned: <b>“Where the ashes are poured out [<i>shefekh hadeshen</i>] shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). This teaches <b>that ashes must be there</b> already when the bulls are burned. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:</b> This verse teaches <b>that its place should slope [<i>meshupakh</i>]</b> downward so that ashes from the burning will slide downhill. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | the congregation and they performed” | Horayot 3a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>Who performed</b> the transgression? <b>If we say</b> that it is the members of the <b>court</b> who performed the transgression, <b>what is the reasoning of the Rabbis, who deem</b> him <b>liable? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that if the <b>court issued a ruling and</b> the members of the <b>court performed</b> the transgression, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>they</b> would <b>be liable</b> to bring a bull for an unwitting communal sin. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to that bull: “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of <b>the congregation and they performed”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that the <b>action is dependent on the congregation and</b> the <b>ruling is dependent on</b> the <b>court.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | are liable, as it is stated: “And the matter is hidden” | Horayot 3b:16 | Another example is if they said: <b>There is</b> a prohibition against engaging in <b>idol worship</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who bows</b> to the idol but does not sacrifice an offering is <b>exempt.</b> In all of these cases, <b>these</b> judges <b>are liable, as it is stated: “And the matter is hidden”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only if <b>a matter,</b> a single detail, is hidden, <b>but not</b> if <b>the entire essence</b> of a mitzva is hidden. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly” | Horayot 3b:2 | § <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> Even in the case of <b>one hundred</b> judges <b>who convened to issue a ruling</b> and erred, <b>they are not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>unless they all issue</b> that <b>ruling, as it is stated</b> with regard to liability to bring the offering: <b>“And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13). From the term “entire” it is derived that the judges are not liable <b>until they all act unwittingly, and the ruling</b> must <b>disseminate</b> and be adopted <b>throughout the entire assembly of Israel,</b> i.e., the Sanhedrin. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Hoshaya, said: So too it is reasonable</b> to conclude this, <b>as throughout the entire Torah we maintain</b> the principle: The legal status of <b>the majority of</b> an entity is considered <b>like all of</b> that entity, <b>and here: “The entire assembly,” is written. Since it is so,</b> a majority does not suffice. <b>Even</b> if <b>they are one hundred</b> judges, they are liable only if the erroneous ruling was unanimous. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | the verse states: “And they performed one of all the mitzvot” | Horayot 4a:10 | <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And they performed one of all the mitzvot”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is inferred that one is liable for nullification for a portion <b>of all the mitzvot and not</b> for nullification of <b>all the mitzvot.</b> The Gemara asks: The term <b>mitzvot</b> is plural, which <b>indicates</b> at least <b>two.</b> If that is the source, there should be liability even if the judges issue a ruling abolishing the entire essence of one mitzva, as one mitzva is a portion of two mitzvot. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Although the word is vocalized in the plural, as mitzvot, the word <b><i>mitzvat</i> is written,</b> without a second <i>vav</i>, as though it were in the singular. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “And the matter is hidden | Horayot 4a:6 | § The mishna teaches: In a case where the judges of the <b>court issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling to abolish the entire essence</b> of the mitzva, that is not a valid ruling, and the court is exempt from bringing an offering. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the matter is hidden</b> from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only when a single matter is hidden <b>but not</b> in a case <b>where they will abolish the entire mitzva. How</b> so? If the court <b>said: There is no</b> prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> written <b>in the Torah,</b> or <b>there is no</b> prohibition against performing prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat</b> written <b>in the Torah,</b> or <b>there is no</b> prohibition against engaging in <b>idol worship</b> written <b>in the Torah,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the judges <b>would be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the matter is hidden,” and not that</b> the <b>entire mitzva will be hidden.</b> Accordingly, if the judges issued that ruling, <b>they are exempt</b> from bringing an offering. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | as “assembly” is stated here | Horayot 4b:12 | This is derived by means of a verbal analogy, <b>as “assembly” is stated here</b> with regard to a court that issues an erroneous ruling: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly” (Leviticus 4:13), <b>and “assembly” is stated there</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of one who commits murder unwittingly: “And the assembly shall judge between the one who struck and the blood redeemer” (Numbers 35:24). <b>Just as</b> in the <b>“assembly” stated there,</b> with regard to the unwitting murderer, <b>all</b> the judges must be <b>fit to issue rulings, so too,</b> in the <b>“assembly” stated here,</b> with regard to the court that issued an erroneous ruling; the court will not be liable <b>unless all</b> the judges <b>will be fit to issue rulings.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | only for rulings of the High Court alone, as it is stated: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly” | Horayot 5a:3 | If the <b>court of one of the tribes issued a ruling and</b> the majority of <b>that tribe performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of its</b> ruling, <b>that tribe is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>and the rest of all the tribes</b> are <b>exempt;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: One is liable</b> to bring an offering for an unwitting communal sin <b>only for rulings of the High Court alone, as it is stated: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only for a ruling of the assembly, i.e., the court, of the entire people, <b>but not</b> for a ruling of <b>the assembly of that</b> particular <b>tribe.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “congregation” is stated above: | Horayot 5a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls, and</b> the <b>court brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of their</b> actions, <b>as</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court,</b> i.e., “the eyes of the congregation,” together <b>with “the congregation,” so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below,</b> with regard to liability to bring an offering the reference is to the <b>court</b> together <b>with the congregation.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “congregation” is stated above: | Horayot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the case of <b>seven tribes that sinned,</b> the <b>court brings a bull on the basis of their</b> sin <b>and</b> the members of the tribe <b>are exempt,</b> as the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public, so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | shall act unwittingly” | Horayot 7b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the court is liable only for absence of awareness of the matter together with unwitting performance of an action, the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated: “And if the entire congregation of Israel <b>shall act unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13). One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that they will be liable</b> to bring a bull <b>for</b> every case of <b>unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Shall act unwittingly, and the matter was hidden”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that the court is <b>liable only for absence</b> of awareness <b>of</b> the <b>matter,</b> leading to an erroneous ruling, together <b>with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action</b> on the basis of that ruling. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | and “from the eyes of” is stated there, | Horayot 7b:14 | The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as the Sages taught: Due to</b> the fact <b>that idol worship left</b> the category of unwitting transgressions <b>to be discussed by itself</b> (see Numbers, chapter 15), one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> the court and the priest <b>would be liable for</b> a mere <b>unwitting</b> performance of <b>the action.</b> Therefore, the term <b>“from the eyes of” is stated here,</b> with regard to idol worship (Numbers 15:24), <b>and “from the eyes of” is stated there,</b> with regard to an unwitting communal sin-offering for all other mitzvot (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as there they are liable only for absence</b> of awareness <b>of</b> the <b>matter,</b> leading to an erroneous ruling, together <b>with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action</b> on the basis of that ruling, <b>so too here, they are liable only for absence</b> of awareness <b>of</b> the <b>matter,</b> leading to an erroneous ruling, together <b>with unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action</b> on the basis of that ruling. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “And the matter is hidden” | Horayot 7b:6 | § The Gemara analyzes the <i>halakhot</i> stated in the mishna: <b>As the court is not liable unless</b> the judges <b>issue a ruling to nullify part</b> of a mitzva <b>and to sustain part</b> of that mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> there is no liability <b>unless</b> the judges <b>issue a ruling to nullify part</b> of a mitzva <b>and to sustain part</b> of it? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we say in the other chapter</b> of this tractate (3b): From the verse: <b>“And the matter is hidden”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), it is derived that there is liability if only <b>a matter,</b> a single detail, is hidden, <b>but not</b> if <b>the entire essence</b> of a mitzva is hidden. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “from the eyes of” is stated there, | Horayot 7b:9 | Therefore, the term <b>“from the eyes of” is stated here,</b> with regard to idol worship (Numbers 15:24), <b>and</b> the term <b>“from the eyes of” is stated there,</b> with regard to an unwitting communal sin-offering for all other mitzvot (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as there</b> the reference is to nullifying the mitzva <b>in court, so too here,</b> the reference is to nullifying the mitzva <b>in court. And just as there,</b> with regard to an unwitting communal sin-offering, the reference is to nullifying <b>a matter, but not the entire essence, so too here,</b> the reference is to nullifying <b>a matter, but not the entire essence.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | and “from the eyes of” is stated there, | Horayot 8a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, the term <b>“from the eyes of” is stated here,</b> with regard to idol worship (Numbers 15:24), <b>and “from the eyes of” is stated there,</b> with regard to an unwitting communal sin-offering for all other mitzvot (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as there</b> the court is liable only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here,</b> the court is liable only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | public: “And performed one of all the commandments | Horayot 8a:8 | The Gemara asks: From where is it derived that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>king?</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“commandments”</b> written with regard to a king and the term <b>“commandments”</b> written with regard to the general public. <b>It is written with regard to a king: “And he performed one of all the commandments of the Lord</b> his God that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 4:22), <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the general <b>public: “And performed one of all the commandments</b> of the Lord that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the general <b>public</b> there is liability only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too,</b> in the case of <b>a king</b> there is liability only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “And they are guilty” | Horayot 8b:5 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says:</b> The term <b>“and he is guilty” is stated with regard to a sin-offering</b> (Leviticus 4:27) <b>and with regard to a provisional guilt-offering</b> (Leviticus 5:17), <b>and</b> the similar term: <b>“And they are guilty”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), <b>is stated with regard to</b> the general <b>public. Just as</b> the term <b>“and he is guilty”</b> that is stated <b>with regard to an individual</b> is <b>concerning</b> a transgression for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering,</b> as it is written there, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“and they are guilty”</b> that is stated <b>with regard to</b> the general <b>public</b> is <b>concerning</b> a transgression for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering.</b> For the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, not a fixed offering. |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “And they are guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord” | Horayot 8b:8 | <b>Rav Pappa says: One derives</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), which are written with regard to a provisional guilt-offering, <b>from</b> the meaning of: <b>“And they are guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), which are written with regard to the unwitting communal sin-offering. The phrase: The commandments of the Lord, is not written with regard to the sliding-scale offering. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said to Rav Pappa: Let us derive</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty and bearing of iniquity”</b> (see Leviticus 5:1, 4), <b>from</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty and bearing of iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). |
| Leviticus 4:13 | and there, it is written: “And the matter shall be concealed from the eyes of the assembly” | Sanhedrin 87a:7 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? He derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>matter</b> written here and the term <b>matter</b> that is written elsewhere. <b>Here,</b> matter <b>is written</b> in the verse: <b>“If there shall be a matter too hard for you in judgment”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8), <b>and there, it is written: “And the matter shall be concealed from the eyes of the assembly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as there,</b> in the verse in Leviticus, the sin-offering of the congregation is brought only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>, and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here,</b> the rebellious elder is liable only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>, and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:13 | “from the eyes.” | Yevamot 9a:6 | <b>And</b> it was stated above that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>idolatrous worship only</b> if it involved <b>a matter that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a community</b> that was guilty <b>of idolatrous worship is derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the phrases <b>“from the eyes”</b> and <b>“from the eyes.”</b> With regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin, the verse states: “From the eyes of the assembly” (Leviticus 4:13), while concerning an unwitting sin of idol worship, it says: “From the eyes of the congregation” (Numbers 15:24). This verbal analogy teaches that a congregation brings a sin-offering for idolatrous worship only if it involved a transgression that incurs <i>karet</i> when performed intentionally. |
| Leviticus 4:14 | that they sinned | Horayot 5a:11 | <b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> one can explain the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it <b>is different, as it is written:</b> “And the sin <b>that they sinned</b> became known” (Leviticus 4:14). The verse underscores that the judges must be aware of the specific sin for which they are liable to bring an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> with regard to an individual sin-offering, <b>isn’t it written:</b> “Or if his sin <b>that he sinned</b> became known to him” (Leviticus 4:23), leading to the same conclusion? The Gemara answers: In the case of the individual sin-offering, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>to exclude</b> one who <b>acts unawares.</b> One is liable to bring a sin-offering for an unwitting transgression only if he performs the action with intent. |
| Leviticus 4:14 | became known, | Horayot 5a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara elaborates on the dispute cited in the mishna. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the judges <b>knew that they issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling, and erred</b> in remembering which erroneous <b>ruling they issued,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable</b> to bring an offering for this. <b>The verse states: “And the sin</b> that they sinned <b>became known,</b> the congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), indicating that liability is only in a case where the sin became known to the court that issued the erroneous ruling, <b>and not</b> in a case <b>where it became known</b> only <b>to the sinners.</b> In this case, the sinners are certain that they sinned, but the court does not know the sin with regard to which it issued the ruling. |
| Leviticus 4:14 | “congregation” is stated below: | Horayot 5a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls, and</b> the <b>court brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of their</b> actions, <b>as</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court,</b> i.e., “the eyes of the congregation,” together <b>with “the congregation,” so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below,</b> with regard to liability to bring an offering the reference is to the <b>court</b> together <b>with the congregation.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:14 | “congregation” is stated below: | Horayot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the case of <b>seven tribes that sinned,</b> the <b>court brings a bull on the basis of their</b> sin <b>and</b> the members of the tribe <b>are exempt,</b> as the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public, so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:14 | “that” is stated here | Horayot 8a:6 | The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word <b>“that” is stated here</b> in the verse: “And the sin that they sinned” (Leviticus 4:14), with regard to the offering brought by the court for the transgression of the public based on their erroneous ruling, <b>and</b> the word <b>“that” is stated there</b> in the verse: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, that is in her lifetime” (Leviticus 18:18), with regard to the prohibition against marrying two sisters. It is derived: <b>Just as there</b> it is <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here,</b> the reference is to <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:14 | “And the sin by which they have sinned is known” | Yevamot 9a:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to an unwitting communal sin offering: <b>“And the sin by which they have sinned is known”</b> (Leviticus 4:14). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to a sin-offering: <b>“By which [<i>aleha</i>],” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the prohibition with regard to a wife’s sister: <b>“Unto [<i>aleha</i>].”</b> This teaches by verbal analogy: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of a wife’s sister, it is <b>a matter that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here,</b> the offering is brought for <b>a matter that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:15 | “And the elders of the congregation shall place their hands upon the head of the bull before the Lord” | Menachot 92a:16 | § The mishna teaches that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon disagree as to whether or not the goats that come for a community-wide violation of the prohibition against idol worship require the rite of placing hands. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull that comes to atone for a community-wide violation of one of the mitzvot: <b>“And the elders of the congregation shall place their hands upon the head of the bull before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 4:15). The verse specifies that this requirement applies to the bull to indicate that, with regard to offerings brought for community-wide transgressions, only the <b>bull requires placing hands, but</b> the <b>goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:15 | shall lay | Sanhedrin 13b:5 | § The mishna teaches: The <b>laying of hands by the Sages</b> is performed by a court of three judges according to Rabbi Shimon and five according to Rabbi Yehuda. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the elders</b> of the congregation <b>shall lay</b> their hands on the head of the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 4:15). One <b>might</b> have thought that the verse is referring to any <b>elders</b> in <b>the marketplace,</b> meaning people who are not members of the Sanhedrin. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Elders of the <b>congregation,”</b> meaning from among the leaders and judges of the people. |
| Leviticus 4:15 | “And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands | Sanhedrin 14a:15 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> respond to this claim? He holds that <b>had</b> the verse written only: <b>“Elders,” I would say</b> that the verse is referring to any <b>elders</b> in <b>the marketplace</b> who are not members of the Sanhedrin. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Your elders.” And if it was written: “Your elders,” I would say</b> that it is referring to members of <b>a lesser Sanhedrin.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “And your judges,”</b> to indicate that they must be of <b>the unique ones among your judges. And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this claim? <b>He learns</b> it by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“elders”</b> written in this verse and the word <b>“elders”</b> written in the verse: <b>“And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands</b> on the head of the bull” (Leviticus 4:15). <b>Just as there</b> it is referring to <b>the unique ones of the congregation, so too here,</b> it is referring to <b>the unique ones among your elders.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:15 | What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? | Sanhedrin 3b:10 | <b>And we say</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The verse states: “And the Elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock” (Leviticus 4:15). The term: <b>“Shall lay their hands,”</b> which is in the plural, indicates that there are <b>two,</b> and the word <b>“Elders,”</b> which is also plural, indicates another <b>two,</b> meaning a total of four. <b>And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>we add another one to them,</b> and <b>there are five</b> judges <b>here.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Yehuda does accept the <i>halakha</i> that a court may not be composed of an even number of judges. |
| Leviticus 4:15 | “the Elders of the congregation” | Sotah 44b:18 | <b>And</b> what is the source of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that the judges may not come from a lesser Sanhedrin? <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> from a verbal analogy between <b>“Elders,”</b> written here, and <b>“Elders,”</b> written with regard to the offering that the Sanhedrin brings when the nation has sinned as a result of a mistaken ruling. This offering is brought by <b>“the Elders of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 4:15). <b>Just as there,</b> “the Elders of the congregation” are <b>the distinguished among the congregation,</b> from the Great Sanhedrin, <b>so too, here</b> the verse is referring to <b>the distinguished among the congregation.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:16 | “The anointed priest” | Kiddushin 36b:2 | The Gemara discusses the mishna’s ruling that women do not perform <b>sprinkling: To which sprinkling</b> is this referring? <b>If</b> this is the sprinkling of the ashes <b>of</b> the red <b>heifer, “Elazar” is written with regard to that</b> action (Numbers 19:4), i.e., this sprinkling is performed by the deputy High Priest. If even other priests cannot perform it, certainly women cannot. <b>If</b> this is referring <b>to</b> the sprinkling performed <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, the phrase: <b>“The anointed priest”</b> (Leviticus 4:16), <b>is written with regard to that</b> rite, and consequently there is no question that women are ineligible. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>of a bird</b>-offering. |
| Leviticus 4:17 | before the Lord | Yoma 58b:6 | <b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin the verse states: “And he shall sprinkle seven times <b>before the Lord</b> in front of the curtain” (Leviticus 4:17). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> Before the Lord? <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said:</b> It is <b>because we find with regard to the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur that when he sprinkles</b> the High <b>Priest stands on the inner side of the altar,</b> close to the curtain, <b>and sprinkles toward the curtain;</b> therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>here, too,</b> in the case of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, it should be <b>the same</b> rite. |
| Leviticus 4:17 | is not stated with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin, | Zevachim 41b:4 | <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> further <b>taught: For what</b> reason <b>is it stated:</b> “Before <b>the Curtain of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 4:6), <b>with regard to the bull</b> for an unwitting sin <b>of the anointed priest, and</b> this <b>is not stated with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> where it merely states: “Before the Curtain” (Leviticus 4:17)? This can be explained by <b>a parable:</b> It can be compared <b>to a flesh-and-blood king against whom a province sinned. If a minority of</b> that province <b>sinned,</b> his relationship with <b>his entourage [<i>pamalya</i>] remains,</b> i.e., the king continues to treat his loyal followers in the usual manner. But <b>if the majority of</b> the province <b>sinned,</b> his relationship with <b>his entourage does not remain,</b> and he no longer meets even those who remained devoted to him. Similarly, when the entire people sins, God no longer has the same relationship with them, and it is as though the place where the priest sprinkles the blood is no longer sacred. |
| Leviticus 4:18 | a base, | Yoma 15b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different that</b> he says to <b>sprinkle</b> first on the <b>northeast</b> corner of the altar <b>and</b> then on the <b>southwest</b> corner? <b>Let him sprinkle</b> first on the <b>southeast</b> corner <b>and then</b> on the <b>northwest</b> corner. The Sages <b>say:</b> That is because the blood of the <b>burnt-offering requires</b> sprinkling on the side of the altar with <b>a base,</b> as it is stated: “On the base of the altar of burnt-offering” (Leviticus 4:18) <b>and the southeast corner did not have a base.</b> Therefore, the sprinkling was performed on the northeast corner, where part of the base of the altar was located. |
| Leviticus 4:18 | in the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 40a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This derivation <b>is not necessary, as it states</b> in these same verses: “And he shall put of the blood upon the corners of the altar which is before the Lord, which is <b>in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 4:18). The superfluous expression “in the Tent of Meeting” teaches that the blood must be placed <b>on all</b> the corners of the altar <b>that are stated with regard to the Tent of Meeting,</b> i.e., on all four corners. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda, what does he do with</b> the phrase <b>“so shall he do,”</b> which Rabbi Shimon interprets as referring to the four placements? |
| Leviticus 4:18 | at the base of the altar of burnt offering, | Zevachim 51a:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to the bull sacrificed for an unwitting communal sin the verse states: “And he shall sprinkle the blood upon the corners of the altar which is before the Lord, that is in the Tent of Meeting, and all the remaining blood shall he pour out <b>at the base of the altar of burnt offering,</b> which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:18). This teaches that the <b>inner altar itself has no base</b> at all. |
| Leviticus 4:18 | “At the base of the altar | Zevachim 51a:20 | The Gemara discusses this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says:</b> The verse states: <b>“At the base of the altar</b> of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:18). This teaches that it must be on the base of the external altar, <b>but not the base of the inner altar.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t that necessary for the matter itself,</b> to teach that the remainder of the blood must be poured onto the base of the external altar? The Gemara answers: That <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from: “Which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 4:18), referring to the external altar. Therefore, the verse mentions the altar of burnt offering to exclude the base of the inner altar. |
| Leviticus 4:19 | “And all the fat thereof he shall take off from it | Menachot 77b:17 | § The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: “And he shall present from it,”</b> indicates that the <i>teruma</i> may be taken <b>from</b> the loaves only when they are joined <b>together</b> in one place. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then concerning that <b>which is written</b> in the verse with regard to the sacrificial portions of the sin offering consumed on the altar: <b>“And all the fat thereof he shall take off from it</b> and make it smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 4:19), <b>there, what is there</b> to be joined <b>together?</b> |
| Leviticus 4:20 | “So shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull | Menachot 27a:31 | With regard to the sprinklings <b>of the bull of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and</b> those <b>of the goats of idol worship,</b> which are sprinkled on the Curtain and on the golden altar, the reason that each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin: <b>“So shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull</b> of the sin offering” of the anointed priest (Leviticus 4:20). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that the bull offering for an unwitting communal sin is sacrificed in the same manner as the bull of the anointed priest, when the Torah has already explicitly specified the manner in which the service should take place? The reason it states it is in order <b>to repeat</b> the command <b>of the sprinklings,</b> |
| Leviticus 4:20 | The Sages taught | Zevachim 39a:12 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>all</b> the offerings <b>whose</b> blood is to be <b>placed on the inner altar,</b> which are the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest, the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and the goat for an unwitting communal sin of idol worship, if the priest omitted even one of the placements, it is as though he did not facilitate atonement. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah first discusses the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest and afterward the bull for an unwitting communal sin, concerning which it states: “And he shall do with the bull, as he did with the bull for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:20). It may be asked: This phrase: <b>“And he shall do…as he did,” what</b> does this <b>come to teach?</b> All the details stated with regard to the first bull, i.e., that of the anointed priest, seem to be stated explicitly with regard to the second bull as well. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | The verse states: “So shall he do” | Zevachim 39a:13 | Rather, the verse comes <b>to repeat the</b> <i>halakha</i> of the <b>sprinkling of</b> the blood, as though it were written twice with regard to the same bull. This repetition of the <i>halakha</i> indicates that the sprinkling is indispensable, thereby <b>teaching that if</b> the priest <b>omitted one of the placements he has done nothing. I have</b> a derivation <b>only</b> with regard to the <b>seven placements</b> on the Curtain separating between the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, that they are indispensable, <b>as</b> these seven <b>are indispensable in all cases,</b> as the Gemara will explain (40a). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to the <b>four placements</b> on the inner altar? <b>The verse states: “So shall he do”</b> (Leviticus 4:20). |
| Leviticus 4:20 | with the bull” | Zevachim 39a:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states: “And he shall do <b>with the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:20); <b>this</b> alludes to a different bull whose service is similar, namely <b>the bull of Yom Kippur.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:20 | “As he did with the bull” | Zevachim 39b:1 | <b>“As he did with the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:20); <b>this</b> is a reference to the <b>bull</b> for an unwitting sin <b>of the anointed priest,</b> teaching that all of the sprinklings of the blood of this bull are also indispensable. <b>“A sin offering”; these are</b> the <b>goats for</b> an unwitting communal sin of <b>idol worship,</b> teaching that they are offered in the same manner as the bull for an unwitting communal sin, their blood being sprinkled in the Sanctuary and their flesh burned. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include also the goats of the Festivals and the goats</b> sacrificed on the <b>New Moons,</b> which are communal offerings as well, i.e., that their service should be performed inside the Sanctuary like that of the bull for an unwitting communal sin. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “So shall he do <b>with this”</b> (Leviticus 4:20), which indicates that this service is performed only with this animal and not with the goats of the Festivals or the goats of the New Moons. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | “With the bull” | Zevachim 40a:10 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>“With the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:20), <b>this</b> alludes to <b>the bull of Yom Kippur. To what <i>halakha</i></b> does this statement relate? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> teach that all matters stated with regard to the bull of Yom Kippur are <b>indispensable,</b> this is <b>obvious,</b> since the word <b>“statute” is written concerning it:</b> “And this shall be an everlasting statute to you” (Leviticus 16:29), and there is a principle that <i>halakhot</i> described as statutes are indispensable. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | The verse states: “So shall he do” | Zevachim 40a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to the <b>four placements</b> on the inner altar? <b>The verse states: “So shall he do”</b> (Leviticus 4:20). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>seven placements,</b> that they should be indispensable? If you say that the reason is <b>that</b> the seven placements <b>are written and repeated,</b> by means of the terms “And he shall do…as he did,” which teaches that they are indispensable, I can say that the <b>four placements as well are written and repeated.</b> Why then should their <i>halakha</i> be any different? |
| Leviticus 4:20 | “With the bull” | Zevachim 40a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did we not learn</b> with regard <b>to the bull of Yom Kippur</b> that these requirements apply? <b>But you said</b> earlier in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“With the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:20); <b>this</b> alludes to the bull of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> which indicates that all the rites performed in connection with the bull for an unwitting communal sin apply also to the bull of Yom Kippur. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | as he did | Zevachim 40b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa</b> that the superfluous phrase in the passage discussing the bull for an unwitting communal sin alludes to the bull of Yom Kippur in order to teach the three <i>halakhot</i> of <i>et</i>, in the blood, and immersion, from the case of the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest, which is also alluded to in that verse. The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>“And he shall do</b> with the bull, <b>as he did</b> with the bull for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:20). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “with the bull”?</b> This serves <b>to include the bull of Yom Kippur for all that is stated in</b> this <b>matter,</b> i.e., in the passage concerning the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest, specifically the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>et</i>, in the blood, and immersion. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | the verse states: | Zevachim 41a:10 | Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall do with the bull, as he did with the bull for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:20). With regard to the first instance of <b>“with the bull,” this is the bull for an unwitting communal sin.</b> And with regard to the second instance of <b>“with the bull,” this is the bull for</b> an unwitting sin of the <b>anointed priest.</b> Due to this juxtaposition, it is as though the burning of the diaphragm and the two kidneys was explicitly written with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> can be taught by juxtaposition with regard to the goats for an unwitting sin of idol worship, as stated by Rav Pappa. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | “A sin offering” | Zevachim 41a:11 | The Gemara analyzes the previous <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>“Their sin offering,” these are</b> the <b>goats for</b> an unwitting communal sin of <b>idol worship,</b> which are juxtaposed in this verse to the bull for an unwitting communal sin. The Gemara asks: But <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive this from the earlier verse</b> stated with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin, <b>as the Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier (39b): <b>“A sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:20), this serves <b>to include the goats for</b> an unwitting communal sin of <b>idol worship. Rav Pappa said:</b> This derivation <b>was necessary,</b> as if there were only the juxtaposition from Leviticus 4:20, it would <b>enter your mind to say: This matter</b> applies only to the acts of <b>sprinkling, which are written with regard to</b> the bull for an unwitting communal sin <b>itself.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:20 | again teach by a fortiori | Zevachim 41a:3 | The Gemara asks: How can the <i>halakhot</i> of the goat of Yom Kippur be derived from the goats for an unwitting communal sin of idol worship? <b>But does a matter derived by juxtaposition,</b> i.e., a <i>halakha</i> that is not written explicitly in the Torah but that is learned by means of a comparison, <b>again teach by <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? There is a principle that a <i>halakha</i> derived by juxtaposition with regard to consecrated matters cannot subsequently teach another <i>halakha</i> via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. The <i>halakhot</i> alluded to by the words <i>et</i>, in the blood, and immersion, are not explicitly stated with regard to the goats of an unwitting communal sin of idol worship. Rather, they are derived from the comparison found in the verse: “And he shall do…as he did” (Leviticus 4:20), which alludes to the goats for an unwitting communal sin of idol worship and the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest. <b>Rav Pappa said: The school of Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that <b>a matter derived by juxtaposition does again teach by <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, even with regard to consecrated matters. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | as he did” | Zevachim 41a:7 | § The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa: “And he shall do</b> with the bull, <b>as he did”</b> (Leviticus 4:20); <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “With the bull”?</b> It is clear that this verse is referring to the bull. |
| Leviticus 4:20 | an anointed priest, | Zevachim 49b:10 | It is written <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>wants to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the diaphragm with the liver and the two kidneys,</b> deriving it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the offering of <b>the bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> then teaching it <b>to</b> apply it to the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>goats</b> brought as sin offerings for communal <b>idol worship. It is not written</b> explicitly <b>in</b> the passage discussing the bull for an unwitting communal sin <b>itself, and it is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the bull for</b> an unwitting sin of <b>an anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest. The offering for an unwitting communal sin is juxtaposed to the sin offering brought by the High Priest in the verse: “So shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this” (Leviticus 4:20). |
| Leviticus 4:21 | as the Sages taught: “And he shall burn it as he burned the first bull” | Horayot 13a:1 | § The mishna teaches: If <b>the bull of the anointed priest and the bull of the congregation,</b> which are brought for absence of awareness of the matter, are pending, the bull of the anointed priest precedes the bull of the congregation in all its actions. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught: “And he shall burn it as he burned the first bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:21). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “the first”?</b> The verse could simply state that he shall burn it as he burned the bull. It is in order to establish <b>that the first</b> offering <b>precedes the bull of the congregation in all its actions.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:21 | outside the camp, | Sanhedrin 42b:7 | <b>When</b> the verse <b>states with regard to the bull</b> brought as <b>a communal</b> sin-offering: “He shall carry the bull <b>outside the camp,</b> and burn it as he burned the first bull” (Leviticus 4:21), it requires explanation, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> “outside the camp,” <b>since it is already stated</b> at the end of that same verse: <b>“And burn it as he burned the first bull,”</b> which indicates that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the bull brought as a sin-offering of a High Priest apply to the bull brought as a communal sin-offering. What then does the verse mean when it states “outside the camp”? <b>To give it a second camp,</b> i.e., it indicates that it must be removed not only from the camp of the Divine Presence, corresponding to the Temple, but also from the Levite camp, corresponding to the Temple Mount. |
| Leviticus 4:21 | outside the camp” | Yoma 68a:7 | Do <b>you say</b> that he takes it <b>outside of three camps, or is</b> he required to take it <b>outside of only one camp? When it says</b> with regard to <b>the bull</b> sin-offering brought for the sin of <b>the community:</b> “He shall carry the bull <b>outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 4:21), that verse requires explanation, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it was already stated: “And burn it as he burned the first bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:21), which indicates that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the bull sin-offering of a High Priest apply to the bull sin-offering of the community as well. <b>And what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states outside the camp? To give it a second camp,</b> i.e., to indicate that it must be removed from the Levite camp in addition to the camp of the Divine Presence. |
| Leviticus 4:21 | outside the camp, | Zevachim 105b:15 | <b>When</b> the verse <b>states with regard to the bull</b> brought as <b>a communal</b> sin offering: “He shall carry the bull <b>outside the camp,</b> and burn it as he burned the first bull” (Leviticus 4:21), it requires explanation, <b>as there is no need</b> for the verse <b>to state</b> “outside the camp,” <b>since it is already stated</b> at the end of that same verse: <b>“And burn it as he burned the first bull,”</b> which indicates that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the bull brought as a sin offering of a High Priest apply to the bull brought as a communal sin offering. What then does the verse mean when it states “outside the camp”? <b>To give it a second camp,</b> i.e., it indicates that it must be removed not only from the camp of the Divine Presence, corresponding to the Temple, but also from the Levite camp, corresponding to the Temple Mount. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | with regard to a king: “When a king sins” | Horayot 10a:10 | <b>And it is also taught in this way</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to a king: “When a king sins”</b> (Leviticus 4:22); this serves to <b>exclude the</b> unwitting transgressions he performed <b>prior</b> to his coronation as king. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | “When a king sins” | Horayot 10a:18 | § Apropos a king, <b>the Sages taught</b> that when the verse states: <b>“When a king sins”</b> (Leviticus 4:22), this serves <b>to exclude</b> a king who is <b>ill.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that he is ill, is he removed from his sovereignty? Rav Avdimi bar Ḥama said:</b> The reference is not to all illnesses; rather, it is <b>to exclude a king who is afflicted with leprosy, as it is stated</b> concerning King Azariah: <b>“And the Lord afflicted the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death, and dwelt in an independent house. And Jotham, son of the king, was over the household,</b> judging the people of the land” (II Kings 15:5). Azariah was removed from his sovereignty when he was afflicted with leprosy. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>states: “In an independent house,” by inference</b> it may be understood <b>that until now he was a servant,</b> i.e., he was in servitude to the people. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | the verse states: “When a king sins” | Horayot 10a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let a king</b> who is no longer king, <b>too, bring</b> a goat as a sin-offering <b>based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if an anointed</b> priest, <b>who does not bring</b> an offering <b>for the unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action, brings a sin-offering after he has moved on</b> from the priesthood, then with regard to <b>a king, who brings a sin-offering for the unwitting</b> performance <b>of an action, is it not logical that he</b> still <b>brings his sin-offering once he has moved on</b> from his sovereignty? To counter this, <b>the verse states: “When a king sins”</b> (Leviticus 4:22), from which it is derived: If he sins <b>when he is king, yes,</b> he brings his sin-offering; if he sins <b>when he is a commoner, no,</b> he does not bring his sin-offering. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God | Horayot 10a:6 | <b>Who is</b> the <b><i>nasi</i>? This is a king, as it is stated:</b> “When a <i>nasi</i> sins, and performs any one <b>of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God</b> that shall not be performed, unwittingly, and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22), referring to one <b>who has only the Lord his God over him</b> and no other authority. That is only the king. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | “When [ asher ] a king sins” | Horayot 10b:2 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states concerning a king: <b>“When [<i>asher</i>] a king sins”</b> (Leviticus 4:22). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Happy [<i>ashrei</i>] is the generation whose king</b> feels the need to <b>bring an offering for his unwitting</b> transgression. <b>If</b> the generation’s <b>king brings an offering, you must say</b> all the more so <b>what a commoner</b> will do to atone for his sin, i.e., he will certainly bring an offering. <b>And if</b> the king <b>brings an offering for his unwitting</b> transgression, <b>you must say</b> all the more so <b>what</b> he will do to atone for <b>his intentional</b> transgression, i.e., he will certainly repent. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | nasi ? This is a king, | Horayot 11a:20 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Who is</b> the <b><i>nasi</i>? This is a king,</b> as it is stated: “When a <i>nasi</i> sins, and performs any one of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God that shall not be performed, unwittingly, and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22), referring to one who has only the Lord his God over him and no other authority. <b>The Sages taught: The verse states: “<i>nasi</i>.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is to <b>the prince of a tribe, like Naḥshon, son of Amminadab.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And performed <b>any</b> one <b>of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God.” Later,</b> in the passage with regard to the king, the verse <b>states: “That he may learn to fear the Lord his God”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19). |
| Leviticus 4:22 | It is written with regard to a king: “And he performed one of all the commandments of the Lord | Horayot 8a:8 | The Gemara asks: From where is it derived that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>king?</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“commandments”</b> written with regard to a king and the term <b>“commandments”</b> written with regard to the general public. <b>It is written with regard to a king: “And he performed one of all the commandments of the Lord</b> his God that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 4:22), <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the general <b>public: “And performed one of all the commandments</b> of the Lord that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the general <b>public</b> there is liability only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too,</b> in the case of <b>a king</b> there is liability only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:22 | “And he performed one of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God” | Horayot 9a:2 | The <b>king</b> cannot become poor, <b>as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“And he performed one of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God”</b> (Leviticus 4:22), referring to the king as <b>one who has only the Lord his God upon him.</b> He is greater than the entire nation and is not a poor person dependent on others. <b>An anointed</b> priest cannot become poor, <b>as it is written: “And the priest that is greatest among his brethren”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), meaning <b>that he is greater than his brethren in beauty, in power, in wisdom, and in wealth,</b> not a poor person. <b>Others say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the High Priest <b>does not have</b> personal wealth, one should <b>make him great from</b> the property <b>of his brethren? The verse states: “And the priest that is greatest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil is poured”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), from which it is derived: <b>Make him great from</b> the property <b>of his brethren,</b> who will provide him with enough property to render him wealthy. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | though he does not know it; | Keritot 17b:13 | <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav?</b> He derives it from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states:</b> “And if anyone sin, <b>and do any of the commandments [<i>mitzvot</i>] of the Lord</b> that are not to be done, <b>though he does not know it;</b> yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 4:22). Rav derives from the plural <i>mitzvot</i> that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering <b>until he is unwitting with regard to</b> one of <b>two</b> items, which in this case is two pieces of fat. The Gemara asks: But isn’t it <b>written “<i>mitzvat</i>,”</b> in the singular form? The Gemara answers: <b>We read</b> it as <b><i>mitzvot</i>,</b> in the plural. In other words, according to Rava, Rav maintains that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative. |
| Leviticus 4:22 | performed one | Shabbat 103a:12 | <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “When a leader sinned, <b>and he</b> unwittingly <b>performed one</b> of any of the commandments which the Lord his God commanded not to do, and is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22)? The Sages taught: I <b>might</b> have thought that one is not guilty until he performs a complete labor, e.g., <b>until he writes the entire name</b> that he intended to write, <b>or until he weaves the entire garment, or until he crafts the entire sieve</b> made from the reeds of the warp and the woof; therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A soul who sins unintentionally in any of the Lord’s commandments which one shall not perform, and did an action <b>from one</b> of these” (Leviticus 4:2). |
| Leviticus 4:22 | performed one | Shabbat 103b:3 | <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states, “When a leader sinned, <b>and he</b> unwittingly <b>performed one</b> of any of the commandments which the Lord his God commanded not to do, and is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22), and from the word one, I <b>might</b> have thought that one is not guilty until he performs a complete labor, e.g., <b>until he writes the entire name</b> that he intended to write, or <b>until he weaves the entire garment,</b> or <b>until he crafts the entire sieve</b> made from the reeds of the warp and the woof; therefore, <b>the verse states “from one.”</b> However, <b>if</b> that is derived from the use of the phrase <b>“from one,”</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one is liable <b>even if he wrote only a single letter, or</b> even if <b>he wove only a single thread, or</b> even if <b>he crafted only a single eye of the sieve.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “one.” But how</b> can we reconcile the two phrases? <b>One is only liable for performing a labor that</b> is <b>of the type</b> that <b>endures.</b> In that case it is considered a complete labor. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | that he sinned | Horayot 5a:11 | <b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> one can explain the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it <b>is different, as it is written:</b> “And the sin <b>that they sinned</b> became known” (Leviticus 4:14). The verse underscores that the judges must be aware of the specific sin for which they are liable to bring an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> with regard to an individual sin-offering, <b>isn’t it written:</b> “Or if his sin <b>that he sinned</b> became known to him” (Leviticus 4:23), leading to the same conclusion? The Gemara answers: In the case of the individual sin-offering, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>to exclude</b> one who <b>acts unawares.</b> One is liable to bring a sin-offering for an unwitting transgression only if he performs the action with intent. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | wherein he has sinned” | Keritot 19a:16 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Even</b> if one <b>intended to pick figs and he picked grapes,</b> or to pick <b>grapes and he picked figs,</b> or to pick <b>black</b> figs <b>and he picked white</b> figs, or to pick <b>white</b> figs <b>and he picked black</b> figs, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt.</b> Rabbi Yehuda added: <b>I wonder if Rabbi Yehoshua deemed</b> him <b>exempt in</b> that case, as even in his opinion the person intended to perform a prohibited labor. The mishna asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so,</b> that he is not exempt according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>why is it stated:</b> “If his sin, <b>wherein he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), from which it is derived that one is liable only if the object of the sin was the one that he intended? The mishna answers: This serves to <b>exclude one who acts unawares</b> and does not intend to perform a prohibited action at all. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | states: | Keritot 19a:18 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him</b> in response: The verse <b>states:</b> “If his sin, which he has sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish” (Leviticus 4:23). It is derived from the phrase: <b>“Wherein he has sinned,”</b> that he is not liable <b>until it becomes known to him</b> specifically <b>with which</b> item <b>he sinned.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Eliezer, what does he do with this</b> phrase: <b>“Which</b> he has sinned”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that only one who is aware of his action is liable, as this phrase <b>excludes one who acts unawares</b> and inadvertently commits a transgression. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | wherein he has sinned” | Keritot 19b:13 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Shimon Shezuri say:</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not disagree</b> with regard to a case where his lack of knowledge involves items from one category. And the last clause in the mishna concludes: <b>If</b> it is <b>so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “If his sin, <b>wherein he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), from which it is derived that one is liable only if the object of the sin was the one he intended? It serves to <b>exclude one who acts unawares</b> and does not intend to perform a prohibited action at all. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | his offering” | Keritot 27b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> i.e., that a son may not bring his father’s sin offering, derived? The Gemara answers that it is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to a sin offering: “And he shall bring for <b>his offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:23). This indicates that <b>one fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering,</b> if his father was obligated to bring a sin offering and died after he designated an animal for this purpose. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | his offering” | Nazir 27b:6 | § <b>Rava</b> also <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav Naḥman’s opinion, from a <i>baraita</i> that deals with sin-offerings. The Torah states: “And he shall bring for <b>his offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), which indicates: <b>He fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering,</b> if his father was obligated to bring a sin-offering and died after separating an animal for this purpose. One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with an offering that his father separated</b> only in a case where the son’s transgression is not equal in severity to that of his father’s sin, e.g., sacrificing his offering <b>from</b> animals that his father designated to atone for <b>a minor</b> transgression to atone <b>for</b> his own <b>major</b> transgression, <b>or from</b> animals that his father designated to atone for <b>a major</b> transgression, to atone <b>for</b> his own <b>minor</b> transgression. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | the verse states: “His offering” | Nazir 27b:7 | <b>However,</b> one might have thought that <b>he does fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with an offering that his father separated</b> if it is <b>from</b> animals his father set aside to atone for <b>a minor</b> transgression and the son atones <b>for</b> his own <b>minor</b> one, <b>or from</b> animals the father set aside to atone for <b>a major</b> transgression and the son atones <b>for</b> his own <b>major</b> one. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), and it repeats: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), to emphasize that <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, and he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering</b> even for similar transgressions. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | “Or if his sin, in which he sinned, became known to him” | Shevuot 18b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: The verse <b>states</b> with regard to a sin-offering: <b>“Or if his sin, in which he sinned, became known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), teaching that there is no liability for an offering <b>until it becomes known to</b> the sinner the manner <b>in which he sinned.</b> According to this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Eliezer himself holds that in order to become liable to bring a sin-offering, it is not necessary that one know precisely which prohibition he violated. |
| Leviticus 4:23 | he shall bring | Shevuot 18b:17 | <b>And</b> Ulla <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: <b>There,</b> with regard to liability to bring a sin-offering, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Or if his sin, <b>in which he sinned,</b> became known to him, <b>he shall bring</b> his offering” (Leviticus 4:23), teaching that it suffices that he knows that he committed <b>some</b> type of <b>sin. Here,</b> with regard to ritual impurity in the Temple, <b>since it is written</b> at the beginning of the verse: “Or if a person touches <b>any impure thing”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), <b>why do I</b> need that which is stated immediately afterward: <b>“Or the carcass of a non-kosher creeping animal”? Conclude from it</b> that <b>we require that he</b> initially <b>know whether he contracted impurity from a creeping animal or he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> and if he never knew this, he does not bring an offering. |
| Leviticus 4:24 | “It,” | Menachot 4a:16 | The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a sin offering, what is the reason</b> that it is disqualified when sacrificed not for its own sake? It is <b>because it is written with regard to</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> in a verse discussing the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). This indicates that a sin offering is valid only when it is sacrificed for its own sake. <b>So too, it is written with regard to them,</b> i.e., the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy: <b>“It.”</b> In the case of the meal offering of a sinner the verse states: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), and with regard to the meal offering of jealousy it is written: “It is a meal offering of jealousy” (Numbers 5:15). |
| Leviticus 4:24 | and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” | Menachot 55b:10 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raises an objection, and some say</b> that this objection is <b>unattributed [<i>kedi</i>]: And</b> is it correct that in the case of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another, one cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>them by</b> analyzing them as <b>a generalization and a detail? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a goat brought by a king as a sin offering: The verse states: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, <b>and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:24). <b>Where is the burnt offering slaughtered? On the northern</b> side of the Temple courtyard, as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:11). <b>This</b> sin offering of a king must consequently <b>also</b> be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 4:24 | a detail and a generalization, | Menachot 55b:15 | <b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> claim raised by Rav Adda bar Ahava: Is <b>this a generalization and a detail? It is</b> in fact <b>a detail and a generalization,</b> as the verse: “And slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:24), appears in the Torah earlier than the verse: “In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering shall be slaughtered” (Leviticus 6:18). A hermeneutic principle states that in this case <b>the generalization adds to the detail, and includes all matters.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:24 | “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, | Menachot 55b:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal <b>itself</b> applies to the goats offered by Nahshon and the other princes? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering of a king: <b>“And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat,</b> and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The verse could have stated: Upon its head. The reason it adds “of the goat” is <b>to include</b> the <b>goat</b> brought as a sin offering by <b>Nahshon in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> |
| Leviticus 4:24 | “it” is stated concerning slaughter, | Zevachim 10b:2 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer then presented a different logical inference: With regard to a sin offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter,</b> in the verse: “And slaughter it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit. And</b> similarly, <b>with regard to a Paschal offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>],</b> in the verse: “It is the sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of the Lord’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27). Here, the word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:24 | “it” is written with regard to it | Zevachim 11a:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse comes mainly to</b> teach <b>that which Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> explained. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that a meal offering of a sinner</b> whose handful was removed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit is</b> due to <b>another reason: What is the reason a sin offering</b> sacrificed not for its sake is disqualified? The reason is <b>that</b> the word <b>“it” is written with regard to it</b> in the verse: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). Since the word <b>“it” is also written with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> in the verse: “For it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), the same applies in that case. |
| Leviticus 4:24 | and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering | Zevachim 48a:23 | The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> that the offering must be slaughtered in the north and the blood collected in the north <b>to</b> perform the <b>mitzva</b> in the optimal manner. <b>From where</b> is it derived that if one slaughters the offering or collects the blood anywhere else the offering is <b>disqualified?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> in <b>another verse</b> which speaks of a goat sin offering brought by a king who sins: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat <b>and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering</b> before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Where is the burnt offering slaughtered? In the north. This</b> sin offering of a king must <b>also</b> be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 4:24 | “it” | Zevachim 48b:5 | § Having derived from these verses that all sin offerings are disqualified if they are slaughtered not in the north, the Gemara questions its earlier explanation. <b>Rather, why do I</b> need the term <b>“it”</b> stated with regard to the sin offering of a king in the verse: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24)? |
| Leviticus 4:24 | “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, | Zevachim 48b:7 | <b>And</b> the reason that it is necessary for the Torah to exclude Nahshon’s sin offering from the requirement of slaughter in the north is because <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering of a king: <b>“And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat,</b> and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The verse could have stated: Upon its head. The reason it adds “of the goat” is <b>to include</b> the <b>goat</b> brought as a sin offering by <b>Nahshon in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The term “of the goat” serves <b>to include</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin offerings for communal <b>idol worship in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering. |
| Leviticus 4:24 | it | Zevachim 5b:10 | Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman explained: <b>A sin offering</b> that was slaughtered not for its sake is disqualified <b>even though its remainder is sacrificed,</b> because <b>the Merciful One</b> specifically <b>excludes</b> a sin offering from being a fit offering if sacrificed not for its own sake, as derived from the verse: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; <b>it</b> is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The redundant phrase “it is a sin offering” teaches that a sin offering is disqualified if sacrificed not for its own sake. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger” | Menachot 10a:12 | The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both a finger and</b> the <b>priesthood</b> to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16). This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> there is the verse that addresses <b>the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>in which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (6a): If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:25 | and place it | Menachot 21a:12 | Rava <b>said</b> to him: <b>You have reminded me of a matter, as Rabbi Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>blood that became congealed,</b> if it is blood <b>of the</b> external <b>sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take</b> of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, <b>and place it</b> upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25), and congealed blood <b>is suitable for taking and placing,</b> as one can take the congealed blood and place it upon the altar. By contrast, if it is blood <b>of the inner sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger in the blood, <b>and sprinkle</b> of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and this</b> congealed blood <b>is not suitable for dipping and sprinkling.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:25 | horns | Sanhedrin 4a:8 | <b>And Rav Huna says: What is the reasoning</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25); and “The priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30); and again: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the minimum amount justifying the use of plural, i.e., “horns,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the horns of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for the mitzva,</b> meaning that he should present the blood on all four horns of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> were mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present it on at least two horns. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | and he shall pour its blood | Yoma 57b:8 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse <b>above, it says:</b> “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of the burnt-offering, <b>and he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering” (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> in the verse <b>below it says:</b> “And the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt-offering, <b>and he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30). The second verse adds the word “all.” |
| Leviticus 4:25 | disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems it fit. The Sages taught: | Zevachim 24a:10 | § The mishna teaches: If the priest <b>collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the service is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems it fit. The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it upon the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25). The conjunction of the term <b>“with his finger”</b> and the term <b>“and</b> the priest <b>shall take” teaches that</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>may be</b> performed <b>only with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, since the word “finger” in the context of priesthood is always referring to the right hand. Likewise, the phrase <b>“with his finger and put it” teaches that</b> the <b>placing</b> of the blood <b>may be</b> performed <b>only with</b> the <b>right</b> hand. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger” | Zevachim 24b:5 | The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both</b> a finger and the priesthood to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16). This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> there is the verse that addresses <b>the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>in which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 6a): If one <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the meal offering is <b>disqualified.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:25 | he shall pour its blood | Zevachim 34b:6 | Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the remainder of the blood of the external sin offering: In the verse <b>above,</b> discussing the sin offering of a <i>Nasi</i>, <b>it states:</b> “And <b>he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). In the verse <b>below,</b> discussing the sin offering of an individual, <b>it states: “And he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30). |
| Leviticus 4:25 | corners | Zevachim 37b:10 | He explains: The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25). Subsequently, the verse states: “The priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30), and an additional verse states: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the mini-mum amount justifying the use of the plural form, i.e., in the word “corners,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the corners of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for a mitzva,</b> meaning that the priest should place the blood on all four corners of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> are mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present the blood on at least two corners. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | at the base of the altar of the burnt offering” | Zevachim 51a:16 | Finally, the verse states with regard to the sin offering of a king: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and place it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering, and the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out <b>at the base of the altar of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). This teaches that you must <b>give a base to the altar of</b> the <b>burnt offering,</b> i.e., that the remainder of any blood placed on the altar must be poured on the base. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | the verse state: “At the base of the altar of burnt offering” | Zevachim 51a:19 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “At the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25)? It is to teach that you must <b>give a base to the altar of</b> the <b>burnt offering,</b> i.e., that the remainder of the blood of the offering must be poured on the base. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | at the base of the altar of burnt offering” | Zevachim 51a:21 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches with regard to the sin offering of a king: The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and place it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering, and the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out <b>at the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). |
| Leviticus 4:25 | “At the base of the altar of burnt offering” | Zevachim 52a:2 | The Gemara analyzes the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Or</b> perhaps it <b>is not</b> so, but <b>rather</b> the verse serves to teach that any sprinkling of blood on the corners of the <b>altar of</b> the <b>burnt offering will be</b> done on a part of the altar where there is <b>a base.</b> The Gemara asks: How can the verse mean that? <b>Is it written: At the base of the burnt offering?</b> This would indicate that the blood of the burnt offering must be placed where there is a base. <b>It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“At the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). |
| Leviticus 4:25 | the verse state: “At the base of the altar of burnt offering” | Zevachim 52a:5 | <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> explained similarly and <b>said: And just as the remainder</b> of the blood <b>of a sin offering, which does not effect atonement and does not come for atonement,</b> nevertheless <b>requires</b> that it must be poured on the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base,</b> with regard to <b>the initial</b> sprinkling of the blood <b>of a burnt offering, which effects atonement and comes for atonement, is it not logical that it requires</b> the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar? The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “At the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25)? It is to teach that you must <b>give a base to the altar of</b> the <b>burnt offering,</b> i.e., that the remainder of any blood sprinkled on the altar must be poured on the base. |
| Leviticus 4:25 | everyone agrees | Zevachim 53a:3 | The Gemara comments: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that the sprinkling of the blood of a sin offering <b>itself is performed only on the actual corner,</b> the one-by-one-cubit projection above each corner of the altar, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the blood may be sprinkled anywhere on the corner, and this will be a fulfillment of the verse: “And put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). <b>When they disagree</b> is only <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the blood may be sprinkled anywhere above the red line on the edge of the altar. One <b>Sage holds</b> that the blood may be sprinkled on the cubit on either side of the edge, because <b>a cubit on this</b> side <b>and a cubit on that</b> side <b>is</b> still considered to be <b>on</b> the <b>corner. And</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>on its edge, yes,</b> it is fit, but any <b>further</b> on either side is <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:25 | itself may be performed only on the actual corner | Zevachim 53a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon says: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a bird burnt offering,</b> as its blood may be placed anywhere above the red line. <b>But with regard to an animal sin offering,</b> the placement <b>itself may be performed only on the actual corner</b> of the altar. This is based on the verse that states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). |
| Leviticus 4:25 | “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering” | Zevachim 8a:1 | <b>“And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25), teaching <b>that</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:26 | shall make atonement | Sanhedrin 4b:4 | With regard to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that a single presentation of blood is sufficient to atone even when bringing a sin-offering, this is not because they hold the traditional consonantal text is authoritative. Rather, their opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin-offering brought by a ruler: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to a sin-offering of a goat brought by an ordinary person: “And the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to a sin-offering of a lamb brought by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35), repeating this term three times. This repetition is <b>due to the</b> following <b>logical inference:</b> |
| Leviticus 4:26 | from his sin, and it shall be forgiven for him” | Shabbat 71b:2 | A dispute between <i>amora’im</i> <b>was stated: With regard to one who ate two olive</b>-bulks <b>of forbidden fat in one lapse of awareness, and became aware of</b> the transgression of eating the <b>first</b> olive-bulk, <b>and then became aware of</b> the transgression of eating the <b>second, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He is liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings, one offering for each transgression. <b>And Reish Lakish said: He is liable</b> to bring <b>only one.</b> Both Sages cite proofs for their opinions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>he is liable</b> as it is stated: “And he shall offer <b>for his sin</b> that he sinned…<b>and he shall bring</b> the ox” (Leviticus 4:3-4), indicating that he is liable to bring a separate sacrifice for each sin. <b>And Reish Lakish said he is exempt,</b> as it is stated: “And the priest shall atone for him <b>from his sin, and it shall be forgiven for him”</b> (Leviticus 4:26), indicating that even if he atoned from his sin, i.e., for part of his sin and not all of his sin, the entire transgression is forgiven. |
| Leviticus 4:26 | shall make atonement | Zevachim 38a:4 | § The Gemara further analyzes the opinion of Beit Hillel that even in the case of a sin offering, if the priest placed the blood on the altar with one placement, he facilitated atonement. <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof <b>for this from here,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering brought by a king: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to the goat brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to the sheep brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35). The repetition of this term is <b>due to a logical inference.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:26 | “And he shall be forgiven” | Zevachim 3b:13 | <b>Here,</b> concerning deviation with regard to the owner, it <b>is written</b> in the Torah concerning a sin offering: <b>“And he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 4:26), indicating that specifically <b>he,</b> the owner, <b>but not another</b> person, shall be forgiven. Therefore, if a sin offering is slaughtered for the sake of another person, it is unfit. <b>The other</b> person to whom this is referring is presumably <b>similar to him,</b> the owner of the sin offering, in <b>that he is obligated</b> to make <b>atonement similar to</b> that of the owner. Therefore, if the other person is obligated to bring a burnt offering and not a sin offering, this disqualification does not apply. |
| Leviticus 4:26 | “And he shall be forgiven” | Zevachim 7a:15 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? The Torah states: <b>“And he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 4:26), indicating that it must be specifically <b>he,</b> the owner, <b>who</b> shall be forgiven, <b>and not another</b> person. <b>The other</b> person to whom this is referring, with regard to whom the offering is disqualified, is presumably <b>similar to</b> the owner <b>in</b> that <b>he is</b> also <b>obligated</b> to achieve <b>atonement similar to</b> the owner’s by bringing a sin offering. Whereas if the other person is obligated to bring a burnt offering, and not a sin offering, this disqualification does not apply. |
| Leviticus 4:26 | as the verse states: “And the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin” | Zevachim 8a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And we found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>slaughter and collection</b> must be performed for the sake of a sin offering. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood? The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:26), teaching <b>that</b> the <b>atonement must be</b> effected <b>for the sake of a sin offering,</b> as atonement is effected by the sprinkling of the blood. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | from among the common people | Horayot 11a:12 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And if one soul <b>from among the common people</b> sins unwittingly in performing one of the mitzvot of God that may not be done and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). This serves <b>to exclude an apostate.</b> When an apostate sins unwittingly, he is exempt from liability to bring a sin-offering even if he repents for that sin, as even his unwitting action is considered intentional. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | The Sages taught | Horayot 11a:3 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if one soul from among the common people sins unwittingly in performing one of the mitzvot of God that may not be done and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). The phrase <b>“from among the common people”</b> serves <b>to exclude the anointed</b> priest; the phrase <b>“from among the common people”</b> also serves <b>to exclude the king.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | in performing | Horayot 2a:15 | The Gemara notes: This matter was already taught <b>in the dispute</b> between <i>amora’im</i> of earlier generations: If <b>a court ruled that</b> forbidden <b>fat is permitted, and</b> the forbidden <b>fat became confused for him with</b> permitted <b>fat and he ate</b> the forbidden fat, <b>Rav says:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as the court ruled that it is permitted, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> as he did not base his conduct on its ruling. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i> that teaches: The verse states: “And if one soul <b>from among the common people</b> shall sin unwittingly <b>in performing</b> one of the mitzvot of the Lord that are not to be done, and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). This serves <b>to exclude an apostate.</b> When an apostate sins unwittingly, he is exempt from liability to bring a sin-offering even if he repents, as even his unwitting action is considered intentional. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | “In performing one” | Horayot 2b:5 | Rava said to Abaye: <b>But according to your reasoning, that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that cites the verse: <b>“In performing one”</b> (Leviticus 4:27), from which it is derived that <b>an individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>on his own is liable,</b> while one who performs a transgression based <b>on the ruling of</b> the <b>court is exempt; how</b> so? When does this apply? If the <b>court ruled that</b> forbidden <b>fat is permitted, and it became known to one of</b> the judges <b>that they erred, or</b> if he was <b>a student</b> who was <b>sitting before them and he is qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, e.g., Shimon ben Azzai, might</b> one have thought that <b>he would be exempt?</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “In performing one,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>an individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>on his own is liable,</b> while one who performs a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court is exempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | shall sin unwittingly in performing | Horayot 2b:9 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna, which states that an individual who performs a transgression on the basis of a ruling issued by the court is exempt from liability to bring an offering, is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. But the Rabbis say: An individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court</b> is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> to which Shmuel refers? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if one soul</b> from among the common people <b>shall sin unwittingly in performing</b> one of the mitzvot of the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27). <b>These are three exclusionary</b> terms: “One,” “unwittingly,” and “in performing,” and one of these exclusions serves to teach that <b>one who performs</b> a transgression <b>on his own</b> is <b>liable,</b> while one who performs a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> the <b>court</b> is <b>exempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | states: “And if one soul | Horayot 8a:9 | The Gemara asks further: From where is it derived that <b>an individual</b> is liable to bring a sin-offering only for a matter for whose intentional violation one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse</b> with regard to an individual <b>states: “And if one soul</b> from among the common people shall sin unwittingly” (Leviticus 4:27). The verse begins with the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <i>vav</i>. This indicates that <b>one shall derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>lower</b> verse, i.e., the verse written later in the passage, <b>from</b> that which is written in the <b>upper</b> verses, i.e., those written earlier. Just as in those verses earlier in the passage, addressing the public, priest, and king, there is liability only for a matter for whose intentional violation one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, so too, in the case of the individual addressed in this verse, there is liability only for a matter for whose intentional violation one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | “and he is guilty” is stated with regard to a sin-offering | Horayot 8b:5 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says:</b> The term <b>“and he is guilty” is stated with regard to a sin-offering</b> (Leviticus 4:27) <b>and with regard to a provisional guilt-offering</b> (Leviticus 5:17), <b>and</b> the similar term: <b>“And they are guilty”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), <b>is stated with regard to</b> the general <b>public. Just as</b> the term <b>“and he is guilty”</b> that is stated <b>with regard to an individual</b> is <b>concerning</b> a transgression for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering,</b> as it is written there, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“and they are guilty”</b> that is stated <b>with regard to</b> the general <b>public</b> is <b>concerning</b> a transgression for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering.</b> For the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, not a fixed offering. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | “And he is guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord that shall not be done” | Horayot 8b:9 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: One derives</b> the meaning of <b>“and he is guilty” and “the commandments of the Lord that shall not be done”</b> written with regard to a provisional guilt-offering, <b>from</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord that shall not be done”</b> (Leviticus 4:27), written with regard to a fixed sin-offering. <b>And</b> the cases of <b>hearing of a voice,</b> i.e., an oath of testimony, <b>and a statement of the lips,</b> i.e., an oath on an utterance, <b>and the defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, for which one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>shall not prove</b> otherwise, <b>as it is not stated concerning them: And he is guilty, and: The commandments of the Lord that shall not be done.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | “the commandments of | Keritot 22b:13 | Rather, <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>there is no juxtaposition for half</b> of a matter. <b>And here, this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, as they derive</b> from the verbal analogy of the expression <b>“the commandments of</b> the Lord” (Leviticus 5:17) stated with regard to the provisional guilt offering and the identical expression <b>“the commandments of</b> the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27) stated with regard to the sin offering that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. One does not derive the <i>halakhot</i> of the earlier passage based upon the later passage, as this aspect of the comparison has been explicitly <b>excluded from</b> the comparison of these two passages based upon their <b>juxtaposition.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | commandments | Keritot 22b:4 | <b>Rather, here,</b> in the case of one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property, <b>this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing a provisional guilt offering: It is <b>because they derive</b> the details of the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the provisional guilt offering written in the verse: “And if anyone sin, and perform one of all the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 5:17), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse stated with regard to <b>a sin offering:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in his performance of any of the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that may not be performed” (Leviticus 4:27). |
| Leviticus 4:27 | fat | Keritot 22b:7 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to the verbal analogy cited above as the source of the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> the following: <b>When we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of provisional guilt offerings based upon the term <b>“the commandments of”</b> used in that context (Leviticus 5:17) and the identical expression <b>“the commandments of”</b> stated with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought for the consumption of forbidden <b>fat</b> (Leviticus 4:27), i.e., a standard sin offering, it is <b>for this</b> purpose <b>that we derive it: Just as there,</b> the verse is referring <b>to a fixed</b> sin offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering, one brings it only for the uncertain transgression <b>of</b> a sin for which one would be liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> offering. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | fat, | Keritot 25b:4 | <b>Rava said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: One brings a provisional guilt offering only for</b> the uncertain performance of <b>a matter for whose intentional</b> performance one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> performance one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering?</b> They derive this <i>halakha</i> by a verbal analogy between the word <b>“mitzvot”</b> with regard to a provisional guilt offering and the word <b>“mitzvot” from a sin offering of</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> i.e., a standard sin offering, where it is written: “Any of the mitzvot of the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27). |
| Leviticus 4:27 | from the people of the land when he does it, | Shabbat 3a:5 | The Gemara asks about the mishna itself: In the latter section of the mishna, instances in which <b>they are both exempt</b> are enumerated. However, <b>wasn’t a prohibited labor performed between</b> the two of <b>them?</b> Since together they performed an act prohibited by a severe Torah prohibition, how is it possible that their partnership will result in both being exempt? The Gemara answers that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> It is written: “And if one soul sins unwittingly <b>from the people of the land when he does it,</b> one of the laws of God that should not be done and he is responsible” (Leviticus 4:27). The verse’s emphasis on the words “when he does it” means: <b>One who does all of it,</b> i.e., the entire transgression, is liable <b>and not one who does part of it.</b> Therefore, <b>an individual, and he performed</b> an action in its entirety<b>, is liable.</b> However, <b>two</b> people, <b>and they performed</b> an action together<b>, are not liable,</b> as each one performed only part of the action. The Gemara comments: <b>It was also stated</b> in support of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said:</b> Amidst a discussion of these matters, <b>it emanated from the group</b> of Sages <b>and they said:</b> From the verse’s emphasis on <b>“when he does it”</b> it is derived: <b>An individual who performed it is liable.</b> However, <b>two who performed it are not liable.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | that may not be done, and he becomes guilty” | Shabbat 69a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> lack of awareness with regard to <b>what</b> aspects of the prohibition renders the action <b>unwitting? Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is an unwitting transgression <b>since he was unwitting with regard to</b> the fact that the punishment for his transgression is <b><i>karet</i>, even though he</b> was aware that his action was in violation of a Torah <b>prohibition,</b> and he performed the transgression <b>intentionally. And Reish Lakish said</b> that according to the Rabbis it is not considered unwitting <b>until he was unwitting with regard to</b> both the <b>prohibition and <i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., he was unaware that his action was prohibited by Torah law. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish? The verse said:</b> “And if one soul shall sin by mistake from the common people, by performing one of God’s commandments <b>that may not be done, and he becomes guilty”</b> (Leviticus 4:27), indicating that it is not considered unwitting <b>until he was unwitting with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition and its concomitant <i>karet</i>.</b> The verse indicates that the individual was unaware that he violated “one of the commandments that may not be done,” i.e., that there is a Torah prohibition with regard to that action. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | “From the common people” | Shabbat 69a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yoḥanan do with that verse</b> cited as proof <b>by Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase: <b>“From the common people”</b> (Leviticus 4:27) teaches that only some sinners, not all, bring sacrifices for their unwitting sins. It comes <b>to exclude an apostate.</b> When an apostate sins unwittingly, he is under no obligation to bring a sin-offering even after he repents. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is derived from the phrase in that verse: <b>“That may not be done, and he becomes guilty.” One who repents</b> due <b>to his awareness,</b> i.e., one who repents as soon as he becomes aware that he performed a transgression, <b>brings a sacrifice for his unwitting</b> transgression. However, one who does <b>not repent</b> due <b>to his awareness</b> that he sinned, e.g., an apostate who continues to sin even after he becomes aware that he committed a transgression, does not <b>bring an offering for his unwitting</b> action. Rabbi Yoḥanan understood the verse in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | by performing it, | Shabbat 92b:12 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who carries a</b> large <b>mass out to the public domain</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable.</b> If <b>two carried it out</b> together, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> them <b>liable, and Rabbi Yehuda says: If one is incapable of carrying it out, and two carried it out, they are liable. And if not,</b> if each person is capable of carrying it out himself, and nevertheless they carried it out together, <b>they are exempt. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> them <b>exempt</b> even if neither was capable of performing the action alone. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the biblical source of these <i>halakhot</i>? The Gemara answers that the source is <b>as our Sages taught</b> in <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, the halakhic midrash on Leviticus. It is written: “And if one person among the common people sins unwittingly <b>by performing it,</b> any one of God’s commandments not to be done, and be guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). The Gemara interpreted: “By performing it,” means that <b>one who performs</b> a transgression <b>in its entirety</b> is liable, <b>and not one who performs part of it. How so?</b> If <b>two</b> people <b>were holding a pitchfork and gathering</b> the stalks, or holding <b>a shuttle and weaving</b> the threads of the warp, or holding <b>a quill and writing,</b> or holding <b>a reed and carrying it out to the public domain,</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>they are liable,</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “By performing it.” One who performs</b> a transgression <b>in its entirety</b> is liable, <b>and not one who performs</b> only <b>part of it.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | it is stated: “By performing it” | Shabbat 93a:1 | In contrast, if two people held <b>a round cake of figs,</b> which is too heavy for one person to carry, <b>and they carried</b> it <b>out to the public domain,</b> or if they held <b>a beam and carried</b> it <b>out to the public domain, Rabbi Yehuda says: If one</b> person <b>is incapable of carrying it out</b> alone, <b>and two</b> people <b>carried it out, they are liable. And if not,</b> if one person is capable of carrying it out alone, <b>they are exempt. Rabbi Shimon says: Even if</b> one person <b>is incapable of carrying it out</b> alone, <b>and two</b> people <b>carried it out, they are exempt. It is</b> with regard to <b>that</b> case that <b>it is stated: “By performing it”</b> (Leviticus 4:27), to establish a principle: <b>An individual who performs</b> a transgression <b>is liable, two</b> people <b>who perform</b> a transgression <b>are exempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:27 | this verse: “And if one person among the common people sins unwittingly by performing it, | Shabbat 93a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>over</b> the interpretation of <b>this verse: “And if one person among the common people sins unwittingly by performing it,</b> any one of God’s commandments not to be done, and be guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds: Three exclusionary</b> statements <b>are written</b> in this verse. It is as if it were written: <b>A person who sins, one who sins,</b> and <b>by performing it he sins.</b> The Torah could have conveyed the same meaning by saying simply: And if one of the common people. Apparently, the superfluous words in the verse are exclusionary and the verse should be understood as follows: A person, and not many people; one, and not two; by performing it, and not by two performing it. <b>One</b> of the terms comes <b>to exclude</b> from liability a case where each of the two people performs a part of the transgression, i.e., <b>this</b> person <b>lifts</b> an object from one domain, <b>and that</b> person <b>places it</b> in another domain. <b>And one</b> of the terms comes <b>to exclude</b> a case where <b>this</b> person <b>is capable</b> of performing the action alone, <b>and that</b> person <b>is</b> also <b>capable,</b> and the two of them perform the action together. <b>And one</b> of the terms comes <b>to exclude</b> even a case where <b>this</b> person <b>is incapable</b> of performing the action alone, <b>and that</b> person <b>is incapable</b> of performing the action alone. Since the two of them violated this prohibition together, they are both exempt. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | not to be done, and be guilty” | Yoma 80a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> it mean to <b>increase the measure? If we say</b> that a future court <b>will obligate</b> him to bring <b>an offering</b> even for the <b>bulk</b> of <b>a small olive,</b> which is less than what is considered an olive-bulk today, he would not be liable to bring a guilt<b>-</b>offering. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It was said with regard to guilt-offerings: “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the things which the Lord has commanded <b>not to be done, and be guilty”</b> (Leviticus 4:27)? This teaches that <b>one who repents due to his awareness,</b> i.e., one who repents following becoming aware that he performed a transgression, <b>brings an offering for his unwitting</b> transgression. |
| Leviticus 4:27 | commandments | Zevachim 48a:8 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is not correct, <b>as everyone</b> holds that <b>we learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the upper passage from the lower passage. <b>And this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis</b> exempt from bringing an offering one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property: They learn a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated here:</b> “And if anyone sin, and does any of the <b>commandments</b> which the Lord has commanded not to be done” (Leviticus 5:17). <b>And it is stated with regard to the sin offering for</b> eating forbidden <b>fat:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the <b>commandments</b> which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and be guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). |
| Leviticus 4:28 | “Or if his sin is known to him” | Keritot 11b:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that by Torah law that</b> if <b>he does not contradict</b> the witness, <b>he is liable</b> to bring a sin offering? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that deals with a sin offering: <b>“Or if his sin is known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), that this is referring to a case where he found out himself <b>but not</b> a case <b>where others informed him</b> of his sin. One <b>might</b> have thought he is exempt <b>even</b> if <b>he does not contradict</b> the claim of the witness. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Or if</b> his sin <b>is known to him,”</b> which teaches that <b>in any case</b> where he knows that he sinned, even if others informed him of it, he is liable. He is exempt only if he denies it. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | separate lapses of awareness, | Keritot 12b:9 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: One is liable to bring two sin offerings only when he ate the olive-bulks of forbidden fat during <b>separate lapses of awareness,</b> e.g., he ate forbidden fat when he was unaware that it was prohibited, and subsequently became aware of the prohibition and then forgot about it and ate another olive-bulk of forbidden fat. This is derived from the verse: “If his sin, which he has sinned, is known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned” (Leviticus 4:28). <b>But here there is</b> only <b>one lapse of awareness.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:28 | which he has sinned, be known to him” | Keritot 19a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that this particular case is an exception? <b>Here, with regard to ritual impurity, it is written:</b> “Or if anyone touch any impure thing…<b>and it was concealed from him that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). This indicates that even when one has <b>knowledge that has an uncertainty to it, the verse renders</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering. <b>But with regard to</b> the rest of <b>the entire Torah it is written:</b> “If his sin, <b>which he has sinned, be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). This teaches that <b>it is</b> only <b>if he has</b> full <b>knowledge that he is obligated</b> to bring an offering. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | be known to him” | Keritot 26b:5 | <b>Rava said</b> in explanation that <b>the verse states:</b> “If his sin that he has sinned <b>be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), indicating that one is obligated to bring a sin offering <b>in any case</b> where his sin becomes known to him. The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you say</b> that <b>when</b> one’s sin <b>becomes known to him he brings a sin offering, why does a provisional guilt offering come? Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The reason is <b>that if</b> one <b>dies</b> before his sin becomes known to him, he <b>dies without iniquity. Rava objects to this</b> claim: If he <b>dies, death</b> itself <b>absolves</b> him, and therefore there is no need for a provisional guilt offering. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The reason that a provisional guilt offering is brought is in order <b>to protect him from suffering</b> until he brings his sin offering. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | for his sin | Keritot 27b:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who designates a sin offering</b> for <b>his</b> performance of an unwitting sin <b>and dies, his son shall not bring it in his stead,</b> neither on behalf of his father nor for his own unwitting sin, even if it was the same transgression. Likewise, <b>one may not bring</b> a sin offering by reassigning it <b>from</b> the <b>sin</b> for which it is designated to atone and sacrificing it <b>for</b> atonement of another <b>sin. Even if he designated</b> a sin offering as atonement <b>for</b> forbidden <b>fat that he</b> unwittingly <b>ate yesterday, he may not bring it</b> as atonement <b>for</b> forbidden <b>fat that he</b> unwittingly <b>ate today, as it is stated:</b> “And he shall bring <b>his</b> sin <b>offering,</b> an unblemished female goat, <b>for his sin</b> that he has sinned” (Leviticus 4:28), indicating that he does not satisfy his obligation <b>until his offering is</b> brought <b>for the sake of</b> the <b>sin</b> for which he designated it. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | “His offering” | Keritot 27b:3 | One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering by</b> means of <b>an animal that his father designated,</b> only in a case where the son’s transgression is not equal in severity to his father’s sin, e.g., <b>from a lenient</b> transgression committed by the father <b>for a severe</b> sin of the son, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression of the father <b>for a lenient one</b> of the son. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>he</b> does <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with</b> the <b>offering that his father designated, from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a lenient</b> sin of the son, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression committed by the father <b>for a severe</b> one of the son. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> a second time: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), to emphasize that <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering,</b> even for similar transgressions. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | the verse states: “His offering for his sin” | Keritot 27b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> further states: One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>even with</b> the <b>money that</b> his father <b>designated, even</b> when father and son committed transgressions of the same severity, i.e., <b>from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a lenient</b> one <b>or from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a severe</b> one; <b>but</b> one may <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with</b> the <b>offering that he designated for himself, even from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a lenient</b> one, <b>or from a lenient</b> one <b>for a severe</b> one. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His offering for his sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), indicating that he does not fulfill his obligation <b>until</b> his offering <b>is</b> sacrificed <b>for the sake of</b> the specific <b>sin</b> for which it was designated. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | the verse states: | Keritot 28a:27 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned, as in the verse: “You shall take it from the lambs or from the goats” (Exodus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:28 | the verse states: | Keritot 28b:6 | <b>Rav Ashi said,</b> with regard to this incident: Yissakhar of the village of Barkai <b>did not study that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned. One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if</b> he bring <b>a lamb</b> as his offering for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:28 | be known to him” | Keritot 7b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference between the sin offering of one who has not yet brought an atonement offering and standard sin offerings? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to a sin offering brought for a transgression, <b>the man requires</b> definite <b>awareness</b> of his transgression for him to be obligated to bring a sin offering, <b>as it is written: “If his sin,</b> which he has sinned, <b>be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). <b>Therefore,</b> in the case where one of two women ate forbidden fat, <b>they do not bring</b> a sin offering together <b>and stipulate</b> that it should be for whichever of them ate the forbidden fat. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a woman after a miscarriage, <b>when</b> these <b>women bring</b> their sin offering they do so only in order <b>to become permitted in the consumption of sacrificial</b> food, and therefore the stipulation is effective. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | “His offering” | Nazir 27b:7 | <b>However,</b> one might have thought that <b>he does fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with an offering that his father separated</b> if it is <b>from</b> animals his father set aside to atone for <b>a minor</b> transgression and the son atones <b>for</b> his own <b>minor</b> one, <b>or from</b> animals the father set aside to atone for <b>a major</b> transgression and the son atones <b>for</b> his own <b>major</b> one. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), and it repeats: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), to emphasize that <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, and he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering</b> even for similar transgressions. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | for his sin” | Nazir 28a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues this line of argument: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with the money that</b> his father <b>separated</b> if it is <b>from</b> money the father set aside to atone for <b>a minor</b> transgression and the son atones <b>for a minor</b> one, <b>or from</b> money the father set aside to atone for <b>a major</b> transgression and the son atones <b>for a major</b> one. <b>However,</b> the son may <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with the offering he separated for himself. From</b> animals he set aside to atone for <b>a minor</b> transgression, he may atone <b>for a major</b> one, <b>or from</b> animals he set aside to atone for <b>a major</b> transgression he may atone <b>for a minor</b> one. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Then he shall bring for <b>his offering</b> a goat, a female without blemish, <b>for his sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), which indicates that he does not fulfill his obligation <b>unless his offering is for the sake of his</b> particular <b>sin,</b> not for some other transgression. |
| Leviticus 4:28 | becomes known to him” | Shevuot 19b:9 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can explain that Rabbi Yoḥanan is precise in his wording, as he says: <b>Here,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>they made</b> awareness of the uncertain status like definite awareness; <b>but they did not do</b> so <b>everywhere in the entire Torah.</b> There is a basis for this distinction, as <b>here,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>awareness</b> at the beginning <b>is not written explicitly</b> in the Torah, but rather <b>it is derived from: “And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), which indicates that there must be some awareness that became hidden from him, and for this, awareness of the uncertain status suffices. <b>But</b> by contrast, <b>they did not make</b> awareness of the uncertain status like definite awareness <b>everywhere in the entire Torah, as it is written: “Or</b> if his sin, which he has sinned, <b>becomes known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), which indicates that in general <b>we require full-fledged awareness</b> at the beginning. |
| Leviticus 4:29 | and slaughter the sin offering in the place of burnt offering” | Menachot 55b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>singled out for this</b> purpose, to teach that even after the fact a sin offering slaughtered anywhere other than in the north is disqualified? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> to teach <b>that this</b> goat sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north, but no other</b> goat sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states</b> elsewhere: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, <b>and slaughter the sin offering in the place of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29), and <b>this established a paradigm for all sin offerings, that they require</b> slaughter in the <b>north.</b> Therefore, the additional verse stated with regard to the sin offering of a king teaches that if he did not slaughter it in the north it is disqualified. |
| Leviticus 4:29 | and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” | Zevachim 48a:20 | § The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a sin offering requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to an individual sin offering: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, <b>and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29). Just as a burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north of the Temple courtyard, so too, a sin offering must also be slaughtered in the north. |
| Leviticus 4:29 | and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” | Zevachim 48b:2 | The Gemara asks: Do <b>you say</b> that it is <b>singled out for this</b> purpose, to teach that even after the fact a sin offering slaughtered anywhere other than in the north is disqualified? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> to teach <b>that this</b> goat sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north but no other</b> goat sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, <b>and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29). <b>This established a paradigm for all sin offerings,</b> teaching <b>that they require</b> slaughter in the <b>north.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:29 | a burnt offering, | Zevachim 48b:25 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabba bar Sheila</b> who says: It is derived via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the slaughter and blood collection of <b>a sin offering</b> be performed in the north <b>comes by virtue of</b> a comparison to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a burnt offering,</b> as the verse states: “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:29), yet if the animal was not slaughtered or its blood was not collected in the north it <b>disqualifies</b> the offering, with regard to the <b>burnt offering</b> itself, <b>as</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the slaughter and blood collection of <b>a sin offering</b> be in the north <b>comes by virtue of it, is it not logical that</b> if it was not slaughtered or its blood was not collected in the north, this should <b>disqualify</b> the offering? |
| Leviticus 4:29 | written with regard to a she-goat | Zevachim 48b:4 | The Gemara explains: <b>As it is written with regard to a lamb</b> sin offering that it must be slaughtered in the north: “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:33) <b>and</b> it is also <b>written with regard to a she-goat</b> sin offering: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:29). This repetition teaches that a sin offering is disqualified if it is not slaughtered in the north. |
| Leviticus 4:29 | the burnt offering” | Zevachim 49a:7 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> there is a different proof that even after the fact a burnt offering that was not slaughtered in the north is disqualified. <b>The verse states:</b> “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of <b>the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29). Since the earlier verse (Leviticus 4:24) already stated: “In the place of the burnt offering,” the repetition in this verse stresses that <b>it shall be in its place,</b> meaning that the offering is disqualified if it is slaughtered anywhere else. |
| Leviticus 4:30 | horns | Sanhedrin 4a:8 | <b>And Rav Huna says: What is the reasoning</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25); and “The priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30); and again: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the minimum amount justifying the use of plural, i.e., “horns,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the horns of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for the mitzva,</b> meaning that he should present the blood on all four horns of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> were mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present it on at least two horns. |
| Leviticus 4:30 | and he shall pour all its blood | Yoma 57b:8 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse <b>above, it says:</b> “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of the burnt-offering, <b>and he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering” (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> in the verse <b>below it says:</b> “And the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt-offering, <b>and he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30). The second verse adds the word “all.” |
| Leviticus 4:30 | “The base of the altar” | Yoma 59a:14 | § The mishna further taught: <b>And he would pour</b> the remaining blood after the blood of an offering was sprinkled <b>on the outer altar, on its southern base. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:30), which is mentioned with regard to pouring the remainder of the blood of an individual offering, <b>is the southern base.</b> Do <b>you say</b> it is <b>the southern base? Or perhaps that is not</b> the case, but <b>rather</b> it is <b>the western base?</b> |
| Leviticus 4:30 | it states: “And he shall pour all its blood | Zevachim 34b:6 | Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the remainder of the blood of the external sin offering: In the verse <b>above,</b> discussing the sin offering of a <i>Nasi</i>, <b>it states:</b> “And <b>he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). In the verse <b>below,</b> discussing the sin offering of an individual, <b>it states: “And he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30). |
| Leviticus 4:30 | corners | Zevachim 37b:10 | He explains: The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25). Subsequently, the verse states: “The priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30), and an additional verse states: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the mini-mum amount justifying the use of the plural form, i.e., in the word “corners,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the corners of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for a mitzva,</b> meaning that the priest should place the blood on all four corners of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> are mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present the blood on at least two corners. |
| Leviticus 4:30 | “At the base of the altar” | Zevachim 53a:10 | § The mishna teaches: He would pour <b>the remainder of the blood</b> on the southern base of the altar. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the phrase: <b>“At the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:30), mentioned with regard to pouring the remainder of the blood of the sin offering of a king, <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>southern base</b> of the altar. The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>southern base, or is it</b> referring <b>only</b> to the <b>western base?</b> |
| Leviticus 4:31 | shall make atonement | Sanhedrin 4b:4 | With regard to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that a single presentation of blood is sufficient to atone even when bringing a sin-offering, this is not because they hold the traditional consonantal text is authoritative. Rather, their opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin-offering brought by a ruler: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to a sin-offering of a goat brought by an ordinary person: “And the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to a sin-offering of a lamb brought by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35), repeating this term three times. This repetition is <b>due to the</b> following <b>logical inference:</b> |
| Leviticus 4:31 | shall make atonement | Zevachim 38a:4 | § The Gemara further analyzes the opinion of Beit Hillel that even in the case of a sin offering, if the priest placed the blood on the altar with one placement, he facilitated atonement. <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof <b>for this from here,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering brought by a king: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to the goat brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to the sheep brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35). The repetition of this term is <b>due to a logical inference.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:32 | “His offering” | Keritot 27b:5 | <b>But</b> one might think that a son can <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with money that his father designated</b> for his offering, <b>even from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a severe</b> one, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a lenient</b> one, <b>as a person can shave</b> i.e., bring the offerings sacrificed, at the end of <b>his term of naziriteship with the money his father designated</b> for naziriteship <b>when</b> the money <b>is unallocated but not when it is allocated</b> for a specific nazirite offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> again: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), indicating that <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation even <b>with</b> money that was designated for <b>his father’s offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:32 | “And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin offering” | Keritot 28a:27 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned, as in the verse: “You shall take it from the lambs or from the goats” (Exodus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:32 | a lamb | Keritot 28b:6 | <b>Rav Ashi said,</b> with regard to this incident: Yissakhar of the village of Barkai <b>did not study that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned. One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if</b> he bring <b>a lamb</b> as his offering for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:32 | the verse states: “His offering” | Nazir 28a:1 | <b>when they are unallocated and not when they are allocated.</b> Consequently, the same should apply to one whose father separated money for a regular sin-offering, i.e., he should be able to use them for his own sin-offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), which serves to emphasize: <b>He fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with</b> the money separated for <b>his father’s offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:32 | the verse states: “If he brings a lamb as his offering” | Pesachim 57b:2 | <b>Rav Ashi said: Yissakhar of Kfar Barkai did not study</b> the <b>Mishna</b> and was an ignoramus who did not know that this <i>halakha</i> is stated explicitly in the mishna. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs take precedence</b> over <b>goats in every place</b> they are mentioned in the Bible. I <b>might</b> have thought that this is <b>because it is a</b> more <b>select species.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If he brings a lamb as his offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32). The Torah passage where bringing a lamb as a sin-offering is discussed appears after the passage describing the sin-offering of a goat. The inconsistent order <b>teaches that both</b> these animals <b>are equal. Ravina said:</b> Yissakhar did not <b>even read the Bible</b> properly, <b>as it is written: “If a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), <b>“if a goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), teaching: <b>If one wishes let him bring a lamb; if one wishes let him bring a goat.</b> There is no clear preference. |
| Leviticus 4:32 | a sin offering, | Temurah 15a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the verse teaching when it <b>says:</b> “And if <b>he bring</b> a lamb as his offering for <b>a sin offering,</b> he shall bring it a female without blemish” (Leviticus 4:32)? <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who separated his sin offering and it was lost, and he separated another in its place and the first one was found alive, and they both stand</b> fit to be sacrificed, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that he may bring whichever of them he wishes? The verse states: “A sin offering.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he</b> must <b>bring both of them.</b> Therefore, the continuation of <b>the verse states: “He shall bring it.”</b> This teaches that he must bring <b>one</b> of the animals <b>but not two</b> of them. |
| Leviticus 4:33 | “And slaughter it for a sin offering” | Menachot 3b:9 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> that Rava holds that the <i>halakha</i> in <b>all of these</b> cases is <b>disqualification</b> of the sin offering. The reason is that the verse states: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). The word “it” indicates that it must be sacrificed <b>for the sake of that</b> particular <b>sin offering,</b> and it may not be slaughtered for the sake of a different one. |
| Leviticus 4:33 | “And slaughter it for a sin offering” | Menachot 4a:14 | <b>And if you would say</b> that there is a principle that <b>there is no partial verbal analogy,</b> that principle does not apply in this instance. As <b>the Merciful One revealed with regard to a sin offering</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of other offerings may not be derived from this case, as the verse states: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). This verse indicates that <b>it,</b> i.e., a sin offering, when slaughtered <b>for its own sake</b> is <b>valid,</b> and when slaughtered <b>not for its own sake</b> is <b>disqualified. But all</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>whether</b> sacrificed <b>for their sake or not for their sake, are valid.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:33 | it | Zevachim 10b:26 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if Rabbi Eliezer accepts that the word “it” indicates exclusivity, <b>let him also say</b> that the verse: “And slaughter <b>it</b> for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:33), teaches that only <b>a sin offering is fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for its sake,</b> and <b>unfit</b> if slaughtered <b>not for its sake. Consequently, other slaughtered offerings, whether</b> slaughtered <b>for their sake or not for their sake, are fit.</b> Why then does Rabbi Eliezer deem a guilt offering unfit if slaughtered not for its sake? |
| Leviticus 4:33 | “And slaughter it for a sin offering” | Zevachim 3b:12 | <b>And</b> he <b>resolves</b> the contradiction as follows: <b>There,</b> with regard to deviation from the type of offering, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). <b>And</b> here <b>a sin offering was slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering,</b> and therefore although it was for the sake of a different sin offering, it remains fit. |
| Leviticus 4:33 | As it is written with regard to a lamb | Zevachim 48b:4 | The Gemara explains: <b>As it is written with regard to a lamb</b> sin offering that it must be slaughtered in the north: “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:33) <b>and</b> it is also <b>written with regard to a she-goat</b> sin offering: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:29). This repetition teaches that a sin offering is disqualified if it is not slaughtered in the north. |
| Leviticus 4:33 | from here: “And slaughter it for a sin offering” | Zevachim 5a:9 | <b>Abaye said to them:</b> Although <b>Reish Lakish</b> cited that verse, he actually <b>introduced</b> the solution to his difficulty <b>from here: “And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). It is derived from the word <b>“it”</b> in this verse that if a sin offering is slaughtered <b>for its sake,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is slaughtered <b>not for its sake,</b> it is <b>unfit. Consequently, other offerings</b> slaughtered <b>not for their sake,</b> including a guilt offering, <b>are fit.</b> And since one <b>might</b> have thought that once they are fit, they also <b>propitiate</b> God, <b>the verse states: “That which has gone out of your lips,”</b> from which it is derived that such an offering does not satisfy its owner’s obligation. |
| Leviticus 4:33 | it | Zevachim 5b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> all other offerings from the <i>halakha</i> concerning a sin offering in this matter, as derived from the verse: “And slaughter <b>it</b> for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:33). |
| Leviticus 4:33 | “And slaughter it for a sin offering” | Zevachim 7a:13 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33), <b>and</b> therefore, as long as the <b>sin offering was slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering,</b> even another sin offering, it is fit. But if it was slaughtered <b>for the sake of a burnt offering</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:33 | as it is written: “And slaughter it for a sin offering” | Zevachim 7b:25 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that if <b>a sin offering</b> is sacrificed for the sake of the wrong type of offering or one other than its owner, it is disqualified? The Gemara answers: It is derived from this verse, <b>as it is written: “And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33), teaching <b>that</b> the <b>slaughter must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 4:33 | for a sin offering” | Zevachim 8a:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>And we found</b> a source for these <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat, as it is written with regard to it:</b> “And slaughter it <b>for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33), indicating that it must be slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering. Likewise, sources for this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sin offerings of a nazirite and a leper have also been cited. |
| Leviticus 4:33 | “And slaughter it [ otah ] for a sin offering” | Zevachim 9b:20 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> a version of Rav’s statement according to which in <b>all of</b> the cases he mentioned, including one where the sin offering was slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering brought for consuming blood or for engaging in idol worship, the offering is <b>unfit. What is the reason?</b> It is derived from the verse: <b>“And slaughter it [<i>otah</i>] for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33), that a sin offering must be slaughtered <b>for the sake of that [<i>otah</i>] sin offering,</b> and no other. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it upon the corners of the altar” | Menachot 19a:2 | The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted</b> as referring <b>to</b> the matter that <b>precedes it and to</b> the matter that <b>succeeds it? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it upon the corners of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:34). The term <b>“with his finger”</b> is interpreted as referring to the term <b>“and</b> the priest <b>shall take.”</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>shall be</b> performed <b>only with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, since the term “finger,” when stated in the context of the sacrificial rites, always is referring to the finger of the right hand. The term <b>“with his finger”</b> is also interpreted as referring to the term <b>“and put it.”</b> This <b>teaches that the placing</b> of the blood on the altar <b>shall be</b> performed <b>only with</b> the <b>right</b> hand. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | shall take” | Menachot 56a:16 | The Gemara questions this inference: The <i>halakha</i> that the one who <b>collects</b> the blood from the neck of the animal must stand in the north is derived <b>from</b> the fact that the Torah could have written: The priest <b>shall take,</b> and instead writes: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take”</b> (Leviticus 4:34). The Gemara explains: This <i>tanna</i> <b>does not learn</b> anything from this distinction between: The priest <b>shall take,</b> and: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take.”</b> Since he does not agree with this derivation, he must therefore derive the requirement to collect the blood while standing in the north from a different verse. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | horns | Sanhedrin 4a:8 | <b>And Rav Huna says: What is the reasoning</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25); and “The priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30); and again: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>horns</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the minimum amount justifying the use of plural, i.e., “horns,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the horns of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for the mitzva,</b> meaning that he should present the blood on all four horns of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> were mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present it on at least two horns. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | shall take | Zevachim 14a:4 | The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach this, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written</b> with regard to an external sin offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take</b> of the blood of the sin offering with his finger” (Leviticus 4:34), <b>and</b> therefore <b>if a monkey comes</b> and <b>places</b> blood <b>on the hand of</b> the priest the priest <b>must take</b> blood from the vessel <b>again</b> to perform the mitzva as stated in the verse, <b>it is considered as though</b> the statement: <b>And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger in the blood, <b>is written</b> with regard to an external sin offering as well. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | corners | Zevachim 37b:10 | He explains: The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25). Subsequently, the verse states: “The priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30), and an additional verse states: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the mini-mum amount justifying the use of the plural form, i.e., in the word “corners,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the corners of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for a mitzva,</b> meaning that the priest should place the blood on all four corners of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> are mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present the blood on at least two corners. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | As it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering | Zevachim 48a:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> from this verse that the <b>slaughter</b> must be in the north. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>collection</b> of the blood must also be in the north? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering</b> with his finger and place it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering, and all its remaining blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As this verse immediately follows the verse discussing the slaughter of a sin offering, evidently the taking of the blood is performed in the same place as the slaughter. |
| Leviticus 4:34 | shall take [ velakaḥ ]” | Zevachim 48a:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the one collecting</b> the blood must <b>himself</b> stand in the north of the Temple courtyard? Perhaps he may stand near the north and extend his arm to collect the blood. The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall take [<i>velakaḥ</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 4:34), which can be read, as: <b>He will take himself [<i>lo yikkaḥ</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 4:34 | shall take” [ velakaḥ ] | Zevachim 48b:23 | The Gemara questions this inference: The <i>halakha</i> that the one who <b>collects</b> the blood from the neck of the animal must stand in the north is derived <b>from</b> the fact that the Torah could have written: The priest <b>shall take,</b> and instead writes: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take” [<i>velakaḥ</i>]</b> (Leviticus 4:34), which may be read as: He will take himself [<i>lo yikaḥ</i>], as explained on the previous <i>amud</i>. The Gemara explains: This <i>tanna</i> <b>does not learn</b> anything from this distinction between: The priest <b>shall take,</b> and: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take.”</b> He does not agree with this derivation, and therefore he must derive the requirement to collect the blood while standing in the north from a different verse. |
| Leviticus 4:35 | the verse states: “For his sin” | Nazir 28a:7 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For his sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:35), which indicates that he does not fulfill his obligation <b>unless his offering is for the sake of his</b> particular <b>sin,</b> and he is not permitted to use money he consecrated for one type of sin to atone for a different sin. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 4:35 | shall make atonement | Sanhedrin 4b:4 | With regard to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that a single presentation of blood is sufficient to atone even when bringing a sin-offering, this is not because they hold the traditional consonantal text is authoritative. Rather, their opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin-offering brought by a ruler: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to a sin-offering of a goat brought by an ordinary person: “And the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to a sin-offering of a lamb brought by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35), repeating this term three times. This repetition is <b>due to the</b> following <b>logical inference:</b> |
| Leviticus 4:35 | shall make atonement | Zevachim 38a:4 | § The Gemara further analyzes the opinion of Beit Hillel that even in the case of a sin offering, if the priest placed the blood on the altar with one placement, he facilitated atonement. <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof <b>for this from here,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering brought by a king: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to the goat brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to the sheep brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35). The repetition of this term is <b>due to a logical inference.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “And he is a witness, | Arakhin 17b:16 | The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the phrase: “And if he is poor,” teaches that one is classified as destitute only if he is destitute from beginning to end, he should similarly derive from a verse that deals with testimony: <b>“And he is a witness,</b> whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1), that this applies <b>only if</b> the witness <b>is fit</b> to testify <b>from his beginning,</b> when he obtained the information about which he is testifying, <b>until his end,</b> when he testifies. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | if he does not utter” | Arakhin 18a:2 | The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different there,</b> with regard to testimony, <b>as the verse states:</b> “He is a witness, <b>whether he has seen</b>…<b>if he does not utter”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). This formulation indicates that <b>the Merciful One renders the matter</b> of testimony <b>dependent on seeing and recounting</b> the content of his testimony. <b>And</b> in this instance <b>there is</b> both valid seeing and valid recounting, despite the fact that the witness was disqualified in the interim. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the exclusion of the verse: <b>“And he</b> is a witness”? |
| Leviticus 5:1 | by Torah law: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” | Bava Kamma56a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And one who knows testimony in support of another but does not testify on his behalf</b> is exempt from liability according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. <b>With what</b> circumstances <b>are we dealing? If we say</b> that the case <b>involves two</b> people who could testify, and their evidence would render the other party liable to pay, it <b>is obvious</b> that each of them is liable according to the laws of Heaven; he has committed a transgression <b>by Torah law: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). Therefore, it is unnecessary for the <i>baraita</i> to mention this case. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “If he does not utter | Gittin 71a:5 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said: If</b> Rav Kahana’s statement is <b>difficult for me, this</b> is <b>difficult for me, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the punishment of one who was called to testify and failed to do so: <b>“If he does not utter</b> his testimony then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1). The Sages derive from this that the verse serves <b>to exclude a mute who is unable to utter</b> his testimony, and he is exempt from bringing the offering of one who refuses to testify. And it is possible to raise the following question: <b>Why</b> is he exempt from bringing the offering; <b>but he is able to utter</b> his testimony <b>through writing?</b> Apparently, written testimony is not valid testimony. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | the unwitting | Keritot 2b:5 | The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in that same mishna (8b): And there are <b>four who bring</b> an offering <b>for the intentional</b> transgression of a prohibition <b>as</b> they do for <b>the unwitting</b> transgression of a prohibition: One who engages in intercourse with a designated maidservant (see Leviticus 19:20–22), a nazirite who became ritually impure (see Numbers 6:9–12), one who takes a false oath that he does not know testimony on behalf of another (Leviticus 5:1), and one who takes a false oath on a deposit, i.e., that that an item belonging to another is not in his possession (Leviticus 5:21–26). <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four? |
| Leviticus 5:1 | here, | Keritot 9a:24 | § The mishna teaches that one who falsely takes <b>the oath of testimony</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression in the same manner as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all</b> those who are liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>it is stated: “And it be hid</b> from him” (see Leviticus 5:2–4). But <b>here,</b> with regard to the oath of testimony (Leviticus 5:1), <b>it is not stated: And it be hid</b> from him. This omission serves <b>to render</b> him <b>liable for an unwitting</b> transgression in the same manner <b>as an intentional</b> transgression. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | with regard to the oath of testimony | Keritot 9a:25 | The mishna teaches that one who falsely takes <b>the oath on a deposit</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“shall sin,”</b> stated with regard to an oath on a deposit (Leviticus 5:21), and the term <b>“shall sin,”</b> stated <b>with regard to the oath of testimony</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is derived from this verbal analogy that just as in the case of the oath of testimony one is liable for committing an intentional transgression in the same manner as an unwitting transgression, the same applies to the oath on a deposit. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | as it is written: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” | Menachot 4a:12 | <b>And furthermore, let one derive</b> a verbal analogy through the term <b>“his iniquity”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering, and the term <b>“his iniquity” from</b> the verse concerning the sin offering brought for the <b>iniquity for hearing the voice,</b> i.e., the sin offering of one who takes a false oath that he does not have any information relevant to a matter when another requests that he testify about it, <b>as it is written: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). |
| Leviticus 5:1 | and he is a witness, whether he has seen or known, | Sanhedrin 30a:26 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> that they disagree with regard to the interpretation of <b>a verse, as it is written:</b> “And if anyone sins, hearing the voice of adjuration, <b>and he is a witness, whether he has seen or known,</b> if he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1). |
| Leviticus 5:1 | a verse: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” | Sanhedrin 30a:33 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> that they disagree with regard to the interpretation of <b>a verse: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), |
| Leviticus 5:1 | is it not already stated: “And he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter it, | Sanhedrin 37b:1 | <b>Why would we</b> want <b>this trouble?</b> Perhaps it would be better not to testify at all. <b>But</b> be aware, as <b>is it not already stated: “And he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter it,</b> then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1)? It is a transgression not to testify when one can do so. <b>And perhaps you will say: Why would we</b> want <b>to be responsible for the blood of this</b> person? <b>But</b> be aware, as <b>is it not already stated: “When the wicked perish, there is song”</b> (Proverbs 11:10)? |
| Leviticus 5:1 | to you, | Shevuot 25b:10 | § <b>Abaye said: And Rav,</b> who holds one liable for an oath on an utterance even if it cannot be inverted to refer to the future, <b>concedes</b> in a case <b>where one says to another:</b> On my <b>oath I know testimony</b> that is relevant <b>to you, and it is found</b> afterward <b>that he did not know</b> testimony that was relevant <b>to him,</b> that in <b>that</b> case <b>he is exempt</b> from bringing an offering for an oath on an utterance. The reason is <b>that it is not in the category of</b> an oath that could be inverted to the negative oath of: <b>I do not know testimony</b> that is relevant <b>to you,</b> as that oath would be an oath of testimony, rather than an oath on an utterance. The Torah states: “And if anyone sin, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1). One is liable to bring an offering for an oath of testimony if he takes an oath falsely denying that he has knowledge of testimony in a monetary matter. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “If he does not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity” | Shevuot 32a:12 | <b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the oath of testimony: <b>“If he does not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), from which it is derived: <b>I said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to you only in a place where, were this</b> witness <b>to utter</b> his testimony, <b>that</b> other individual <b>becomes liable</b> to make <b>a monetary</b> payment, i.e., in court. He is not liable for denial in a place where his testimony would not render one liable to pay. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “And he is a witness or he saw or he knew” | Shevuot 33b:15 | <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> cites a different proof and <b>says:</b> The verse <b>states</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is <b>with regard to testimony that is founded on sight,</b> i.e., direct observation, <b>without knowledge</b> of the matter, <b>or by means of</b> indirect <b>knowledge</b> of the matter <b>without sight</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “or” are stated here, | Shevuot 33b:9 | § <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the verse</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>is speaking only about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim? Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Multiple instances of the term <b>“or” are stated here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: “And he hears the voice of an oath and he is a witness or he saw or he knew” (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or” are stated there,</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit: “And he deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of an outstanding loan, or of robbery, or he exploited his colleague, or he found a lost item” (Leviticus 5:21–22); <b>just as there,</b> the verse <b>is speaking only about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim, so too here,</b> the verse <b>is speaking only about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “And he is a witness or he saw or he knew” | Shevuot 34a:16 | § <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> cites a different proof and <b>says:</b> The verse states with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is <b>with regard to testimony that is founded on sight without knowledge</b> of the matter, <b>or by means of knowledge without sight,</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> The reference is to testimony involving monetary matters, as all other testimony requires both knowledge and sight. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “Shall sin” | Shevuot 34a:3 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath of testimony and states <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy. Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“Shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit: <b>“Shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> concerning an oath on a deposit, the verse <b>is speaking only with regard to a monetary claim, so too here,</b> concerning an oath of testimony, the verse <b>is speaking only with regard to a monetary claim.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | from “shall sin” | Shevuot 34b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, he should have derived</b> it <b>from</b> the case of an oath of <b>testimony, as</b> that is a derivation of <b>“shall sin”</b> written with regard to an oath on a deposit which is derived <b>from “shall sin”</b> written with regard to an oath of testimony: “And if any one shall sin and he hears the voice of an oath, and he is a witness” (Leviticus 5:1). |
| Leviticus 5:1 | the verse states: “And he heard the voice of an oath and he is a witness or he saw or he knew” | Shevuot 35a:10 | <b>The Sages taught: I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf;</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he heard the voice of an oath and he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). One is liable to bring an offering for a false oath only in a case <b>where</b> knowledge of the <b>testimony preceded the oath, and not</b> in a case <b>where the oath preceded</b> knowledge of the <b>testimony.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | they would be liable. The verse states: “And he is a witness” | Shevuot 35a:13 | The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one saw a group of people standing, and his witnesses</b> were <b>among them, and he said to</b> the entire group: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf,</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable. The verse states: “And he is a witness”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> in this case <b>he did not specify his witnesses;</b> therefore, they are not liable. One <b>might</b> have thought that the <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>even</b> if <b>he said:</b> I administer an oath to <b>everyone who is standing here</b> that you will come and testify on my behalf. <b>The verse states: “And he is a witness”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> in this case, although he spoke to a group, <b>he specified his witnesses;</b> therefore, they are liable. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | they would be liable. The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity” | Shevuot 35a:14 | The mishna teaches that if <b>one said to two</b> individuals: <b>I administer an oath to you,</b> and they know testimony relevant to him based on hearsay, or if one of the witnesses is found to be a relative or disqualified, they are exempt. The Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught:</b> If <b>one said to two</b> individuals: <b>I administer an oath to you, so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> that <b>if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, and they know testimony</b> relevant <b>to him</b> based on <b>hearsay testimony, or</b> if <b>one of</b> the witnesses is <b>a relative or disqualified,</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable. The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), teaching that it is <b>with regard to</b> those <b>eligible for</b> the <b>statement</b> of testimony that <b>the verse is speaking,</b> not those who are ineligible. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | they would be liable? The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity” | Shevuot 35a:15 | The mishna teaches: If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, etc. The Sages taught:</b> If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, or</b> in a case <b>where the defendant said to</b> the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to</b> the plaintiff <b>that you will come and testify on his behalf, might</b> one have thought that <b>they would be liable? The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); therefore, they are not liable. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “shall sin” | Shevuot 35a:8 | <b>Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim. In the case cited in the <i>baraita</i> and in the first clause of the mishna, the plaintiff does not have a legitimate claim. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “And he heard the voice of an ala ” | Shevuot 35b:23 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that cites the verse: <b>“The Lord shall render you as a curse and as an oath”</b> (Numbers 5:21). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> at the beginning of the verse: <b>“And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing”? Due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he heard the voice of an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), one may infer: <b><i>Ala</i> is stated here</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>and <i>ala</i> is stated there</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>; <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the reference is to <b>an oath, so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the reference is to <b>an oath.</b> And <b>just as there,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too here,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God. This is contrary to the mishna, where the ruling is that an oath of testimony may be administered even in the name of appellations of God. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | an ala ” | Shevuot 35b:26 | The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to an oath of testimony: “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); <b><i>ala</i> is nothing other than an expression</b> meaning <b>oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing [<i>ha’ala</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:21). |
| Leviticus 5:1 | The verse states: “And he hears the voice of an ala ” | Shevuot 36a:1 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to render an <i>ala</i> with which</b> the word <b>oath is not</b> written <b>like an <i>ala</i> with which</b> the word <b>oath is</b> written <b>and an oath with which</b> the word <b><i>ala</i> is not</b> written <b>like an oath with which</b> the word <b><i>ala</i> is</b> written? <b>The verse states: “And he hears the voice of an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). The phrase “the voice of an <i>ala</i>” is unnecessary, as it would have been sufficient to write: And he heard an <i>ala</i>. It is interpreted as though it were written: <b>And he heard an <i>ala</i> and he heard a voice.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | for “hearing the voice” | Shevuot 7a:1 | <b>one can bring a sliding-scale</b> offering for the unwitting violation of a transgression whose intentional violation is not punishable by <i>karet</i>; <b>just as is</b> the case of a violation <b>for “hearing the voice”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), which is where a litigant asks a witness to testify about an event and he takes a false oath that he did not witness the event, <b>and for</b> taking a false oath with the <b>“utterance of lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). In both of these cases, an intentional violation is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, and nevertheless one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for an unwitting violation. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | as it is written: “And if anyone sins, in that he heard the voice of adjuration” | Sotah 33a:11 | It is stated in the mishna that <b>an oath of testimony</b> may be said in any language, <b>as it is written: “And if anyone sins, in that he heard the voice of adjuration”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). The emphasis on hearing in the verse is interpreted to mean that it can be recited <b>in any language that a person hears,</b> i.e., understands. |
| Leviticus 5:1 | “sins” | Sotah 33a:12 | It is stated in the mishna that <b>an oath on a deposit</b> may be taken in any language. This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“sins”</b> (Leviticus 5:21) that appears in the portion of an oath on a deposit, and the word <b>“sins”</b> (Leviticus 5:1) that is mentioned in the portion of <b>an oath of testimony.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:1 | the verse states: “If he does not utter it, | Yoma 74a:4 | The Gemara rejects this by distinguishing between the two cases: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of testimony, where <b>the verse states: “If he does not utter it,</b> then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1), i.e., a man who can testify but doesn’t do so should be punished. <b>But this person cannot ever give testimony</b> since the court will not accept his testimony. The Torah makes liability for an oath of testimony contingent on one’s ability to testify. Therefore, an oath of testimony would not apply to someone unable to testify. However, one who takes an oath not to eat is liable if he breaks that oath, notwithstanding the rabbinic prohibition against eating less than a measure of forbidden food. Consequently, this rejection does not stand, and the first explanation remains. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | that a carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal imparts impurity, | Chullin 70b:12 | § It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> a student of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says: I said [<i>namti</i>] to ben Azzai: We learned that a carcass of a kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity</b> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). <b>And</b> we learned that <b>a carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> and <b>that a carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> from the verse: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal” (Leviticus 5:2). |
| Leviticus 5:2 | “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of an impure creeping animal, | Chullin 70b:9 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the sliding-scale offering brought by one who was unaware that he was impure when he ate consecrated food or entered the Temple: <b>“A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of an impure creeping animal,</b> and is guilty, it having being hidden from him that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2). |
| Leviticus 5:2 | as it is taught | Chullin 71a:6 | The principle that <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i></b> is relevant <b>with regard to that which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi taught, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse delineates a case in which one is obligated to bring a sliding-scale offering as an atonement: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>], or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>], or the carcass of an impure creeping animal, and is guilty, it having being hidden from him that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2). But the nature of the transgression for which the person requires atonement is not apparent from the verse. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | as it is written: “And he is ritually impure and he is guilty” | Horayot 8b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what difference</b> is there between the different verb conjugations? <b>But didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. If a verbal analogy can be derived between two different terms, it can certainly be derived from two conjugations of the same term. <b>And furthermore, let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“and he is guilty,”</b> written <b>with regard to the defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as it is written: “And he is ritually impure and he is guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), which is a verbal analogy between identical terms. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | and it was concealed from him that he is impure” | Keritot 19a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that this particular case is an exception? <b>Here, with regard to ritual impurity, it is written:</b> “Or if anyone touch any impure thing…<b>and it was concealed from him that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). This indicates that even when one has <b>knowledge that has an uncertainty to it, the verse renders</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering. <b>But with regard to</b> the rest of <b>the entire Torah it is written:</b> “If his sin, <b>which he has sinned, be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). This teaches that <b>it is</b> only <b>if he has</b> full <b>knowledge that he is obligated</b> to bring an offering. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | creeping animal, and it is hidden from him” | Niddah 28b:4 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 14b) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing…or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). A precise reading of this verse indicates that <b>if</b> one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he contracted ritual impurity by touching a carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering for defiling the Temple or the sacrificial food, <b>but he is not liable</b> to bring such an offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | “And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure” | Niddah 28b:5 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it is derived from the phrase: <b>“And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), that <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that one had contracted <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> he <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | creeping animal, and it is hidden from him” | Shevuot 14b:5 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing, whether it is the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). A precise reading of this verse indicates that in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted ritual impurity by touching <b>a creeping animal,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering for having defiled the Temple or the sacrificial food, <b>but he is not liable</b> to bring such an offering in a case where he has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | “And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure” | Shevuot 14b:6 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), thereby teaching that in a case when one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> one <b>is not liable</b> to bring such an offering in a case when he has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | “And it is hidden | Shevuot 14b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), and it states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:3), <b>twice,</b> in order <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering both in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity and</b> in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:2 | creeping animal, and it is hidden from him, | Shevuot 18b:12 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing, whether it is the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him,</b> so that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2). The juxtaposition of the words “and it is hidden” to the words “a creeping animal” teaches that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering when it was hidden from him that he had contracted ritual impurity from a creeping animal, but not when it was hidden from him that he was entering the Temple or partaking of sacrificial food. Rabbi Akiva says that it is from the words “and it is hidden from him, so that he is impure” that it is derived that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for a lapse of awareness about his impurity, but not for a lapse of awareness about the Temple or the sacrificial food. The Gemara asks: Since Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva agree about the <i>halakha</i>, <b>what is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:2 | any impure thing” | Shevuot 18b:17 | <b>And</b> Ulla <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: <b>There,</b> with regard to liability to bring a sin-offering, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Or if his sin, <b>in which he sinned,</b> became known to him, <b>he shall bring</b> his offering” (Leviticus 4:23), teaching that it suffices that he knows that he committed <b>some</b> type of <b>sin. Here,</b> with regard to ritual impurity in the Temple, <b>since it is written</b> at the beginning of the verse: “Or if a person touches <b>any impure thing”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), <b>why do I</b> need that which is stated immediately afterward: <b>“Or the carcass of a non-kosher creeping animal”? Conclude from it</b> that <b>we require that he</b> initially <b>know whether he contracted impurity from a creeping animal or he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> and if he never knew this, he does not bring an offering. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | it is derived from: “And it is hidden | Shevuot 19b:9 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can explain that Rabbi Yoḥanan is precise in his wording, as he says: <b>Here,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>they made</b> awareness of the uncertain status like definite awareness; <b>but they did not do</b> so <b>everywhere in the entire Torah.</b> There is a basis for this distinction, as <b>here,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>awareness</b> at the beginning <b>is not written explicitly</b> in the Torah, but rather <b>it is derived from: “And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), which indicates that there must be some awareness that became hidden from him, and for this, awareness of the uncertain status suffices. <b>But</b> by contrast, <b>they did not make</b> awareness of the uncertain status like definite awareness <b>everywhere in the entire Torah, as it is written: “Or</b> if his sin, which he has sinned, <b>becomes known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), which indicates that in general <b>we require full-fledged awareness</b> at the beginning. |
| Leviticus 5:2 | as it is taught | Shevuot 7a:5 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “Or if a person will have touched any impure object, whether the carcass of an impure animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] or the carcass of an impure domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>]” (Leviticus 5:2). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Since a domesticated animal is also referred to as a <i>ḥayya</i>, it would be sufficient if <b>I would read</b> only the verse’s clause about <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>. Why</b> then is an explicit clause about <b>a <i>behema</i> stated?</b> It is in order to derive a verbal analogy. It is <b>stated</b> in the verse <b>here: “An impure domesticated animal,” and it is stated</b> in the verse <b>below</b> with regard to one who intentionally defiles an offering by partaking of it while he is impure: <b>“An impure domesticated animal”</b> (Leviticus 7:21). <b>Just as below</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods. |
| Leviticus 5:3 | “And it is hidden | Shevuot 14b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), and it states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:3), <b>twice,</b> in order <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering both in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity and</b> in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:3 | “And he was aware” | Shevuot 4b:1 | <b>“And it was concealed,”</b> which indicates, <b>by inference, that</b> initially <b>he had been aware,</b> and nevertheless the verse continues to state: <b>“And he was aware”</b> (Leviticus 5:3). It emerges that the verse refers <b>here</b> to <b>two</b> different <b>periods of awareness,</b> one before the transgression and one afterward. But <b>if so, why</b> must <b>the verses state: “And it was concealed,” “and it was concealed,”</b> mentioning it twice? It is in order <b>to render one liable</b> both <b>for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact he was <b>ritually impure and for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that the place he entered was actually the <b>Temple.</b> From this <i>baraita</i> it is apparent that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion concerning which types of lapses of awareness render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. |
| Leviticus 5:3 | in any manner of his impurity | Shevuot 7a:17 | <b>Rather, Rava said: It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“his impurity”</b> and <b>“his impurity,”</b> as follows: <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to a sliding-scale offering: “Or if he will touch impurity of a man <b>in any manner of his impurity</b> through which he can become impure” (Leviticus 5:3), |
| Leviticus 5:3 | through which | Shevuot 7a:2 | The Gemara answers: It cannot be referring to one who partakes of <i>teruma</i> while ritually impure, as <b>the verse</b> concerning a sliding-scale offering <b>states:</b> “Or if he will touch impurity of a man in any manner of his impurity <b>through which</b> he can become impure” (Leviticus 5:3). The verse states <b>“through which” to exclude</b> an impure person who partakes of <b><i>teruma</i></b> from liability to bring a sliding-scale offering. |
| Leviticus 5:3 | “through which” | Shevuot 7a:8 | The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One excludes</b> something with the term <b>“through which”</b> (Leviticus 5:3). Should <b>we say</b> that the term <b>“through which”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the defiling of the <b>Temple?</b> No, it <b>is reasonable</b> that <b>we should not exclude</b> the defiling of the <b>Temple, as</b> its intentional violation is punishable <b>by <i>karet</i>, just like</b> one who defiles sacrificial foods by partaking of them while he is impure. Rather, the term must serve to exclude one who partakes of <i>teruma</i> while impure. |
| Leviticus 5:3 | “through which” | Shevuot 7b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“through which”</b> (Leviticus 5:3)? The Gemara earlier derived from this term that one who is impure and unwittingly eats <i>teruma</i> is not liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. The Gemara has now derived that the sliding-scale offering atones specifically for the unwitting defiling of the Temple. If so, it is obvious that one is not liable for unwittingly eating <i>teruma</i>, and the phrase is superfluous. |
| Leviticus 5:3 | “Or if he will touch | Shevuot 7b:4 | The Gemara challenges: But <b>didn’t you say</b> above that the term <b>“through which” is a restriction?</b> How can you now use it to include additional cases? The Gemara explains: It is precisely <b>because it is a restriction</b> that <b>it includes</b> additional cases. As <b>it is written</b> at the beginning of that verse: <b>“Or if he will touch</b> an impurity of a man” (Leviticus 5:3), which indicates that one who is impure with a form of impurity <b>that can</b> impart impurity through <b>touching, yes,</b> he is liable for defiling the Temple by entering it in his impure state. But if one is impure with a form of impurity <b>that cannot</b> impart impurity through <b>touching,</b> then one would <b>not</b> be liable. Therefore, the verse opens with a restriction, and when the verse continues, <b>and it is written “through which,”</b> which is also <b>a restriction,</b> this <b>constitutes a restriction after a restriction, and a restriction after a restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i>, applying it to additional cases. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil or to do good” | Bava Kamma91b:2 | § The Gemara discusses whether it is permitted to injure oneself. <b>And is a person not permitted to injure himself? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that if one <b>takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil he will be exempt</b> from bringing an offering for having transgressed this oath. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips <b>to do evil or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), which teaches that <b>just as</b> taking an oath to <b>do good</b> for which one is liable is referring to <b>an optional</b> activity, as opposed to taking an oath to perform a mitzva, <b>so too,</b> taking an oath to <b>do evil</b> is referring to <b>an optional</b> activity, as opposed to taking an oath to transgress. <b>I</b> can therefore <b>include</b> within the category of one who is liable if he transgressed his oath the person who <b>takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil</b>. It is clear from this <i>baraita</i> that doing evil to oneself is permitted. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | “Or if a soul takes an oath clearly to utter with lips” | Bava Metzia36a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>teaching us</b> with this systematic presentation of these cases? They are merely details based on established halakhic principles. The Gemara answers: His statement serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami, who says:</b> With regard to <b>any oath that the judges administer, one is not liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for taking a false <b>oath</b> on <b>an utterance, as it is stated</b> in the passage concerning the obligation to bring an offering for taking a false oath: <b>“Or if a soul takes an oath clearly to utter with lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). The Gemara infers: The liability to bring an offering for taking a false oath applies only to one <b>who takes an oath on his own</b> initiative, but not when the oath is administered by others. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami,</b> as one is liable to bring a sin-offering for taking a false oath on an utterance even if it was administered by another. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil, or to do good” | Nazir 62b:9 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to oaths: “Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Just as</b> the <b>“good”</b> mentioned in this verse is referring to <b>a voluntary</b> action, <b>so too</b> the <b>“evil”</b> is <b>voluntary,</b> e.g., if he takes an oath not to derive benefit from an item. This <b>excludes</b> a slave, whose oath or vow <b>would cause evil to others, as it is not in his power</b> to affect his master adversely. Therefore, his statement is invalid. Here too, as the owner will suffer if his slave’s diet is restricted, a slave may not accept a vow or an oath upon himself. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil, or to do good” | Nedarim 17a:1 | However, <b>the verse states:</b> “Or if anyone swears clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). From the juxtaposition of evil and good it is derived that <b>just as the doing of good,</b> which is interpreted as obligating himself to take a positive action, is referring to a <b>permitted</b> activity, e.g., to eat, <b>so too, the doing of evil,</b> which is interpreted as prohibiting himself from something, refers only to that which is <b>permitted,</b> e.g., not to eat. This <b>excludes</b> one who <b>takes an oath to nullify a mitzva and does not nullify it;</b> he is not liable for violating the oath, <b>as the permission</b> to nullify it <b>is not in his power.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:4 | “And it is hidden | Shevuot 19b:11 | The Gemara challenges: It is <b>obvious that</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>does not require</b> awareness at the beginning, <b>since he has no superfluous verses</b> from which to derive such a requirement. Rabbi Akiva learns from the superfluous phrase: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:4), that awareness at the beginning is necessary, but Rabbi Yishmael says the verse serves to teach another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that he was entering <b>the Temple.</b> The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>Lest you say: When</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>does not accept</b> this <i>halakha</i> requiring awareness at the beginning, it means that he does not derive it <b>from a verse, but he accepts</b> it <b>as a tradition;</b> to counter this, Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> that according to Rabbi Yishmael there is no requirement whatsoever for awareness at the beginning. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | as it is written: “Or if anyone take an oath to clearly utter with his lips” | Shevuot 20a:6 | The Gemara analyzes Abaye’s explanation: <b>From where</b> may one derive that <b>“clear utterance” is an oath?</b> One derives it from the verse written with regard to an oath on an utterance, <b>as it is written: “Or if anyone take an oath to clearly utter with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>“bond” also</b> referring to an oath, <b>as it is written: “Every vow, and every oath of a bond</b> to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void” (Numbers 30:14)? |
| Leviticus 5:4 | it is written: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” | Shevuot 20a:8 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t the term <b>“clear utterance” also</b> associated with an oath in a verse, as <b>it is written: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4)? |
| Leviticus 5:4 | can be positive or negative. | Shevuot 25a:18 | The Gemara explains the opinions: <b>Rav says</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as the oath <b>can be positive or negative.</b> The Sages derived from the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good” (Leviticus 5:4), that one is liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance only when the oath is such that it could be inverted from the positive to the negative and vice versa. Since he can take an oath either that he threw the stone or that he did not, he is liable. <b>And Shmuel says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because the oath <b>cannot be</b> stated <b>with regard to the future;</b> he cannot control what so-and-so will do in the future. Consequently, it is an oath taken in vain, rather than an oath on an utterance. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil, or to do good, | Shevuot 25a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva? As we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future, as it is stated:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good,</b> whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so,</b> and one is liable only for oaths explicitly mentioned in the verse, then <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil, or to do good, | Shevuot 25a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future, as it is stated:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good,</b> whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4). The Torah refers explicitly only to oaths about what one will do in the future. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil, or to do good” | Shevuot 25b:5 | <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis: Shmuel</b> holds <b>like the Rabbis,</b> that one is exempt in the case of an oath that cannot be inverted. Accordingly, Shmuel ruled that one who takes an oath that so-and-so threw an item is exempt from bringing an offering if it is found that the statement was false. <b>And Rav</b> holds that <b>the Rabbis do not deem one liable in</b> the case of an oath that cannot be inverted from <b>negative</b> to <b>positive</b> or vice versa, <b>as it is written explicitly:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>But</b> with regard to the requirement that it be possible to invert an oath referring <b>to the future</b> to refer <b>to the past</b> or vice versa, <b>which is derived from an amplification of</b> the meaning of <b>the verses,</b> the Rabbis <b>deem one liable,</b> as they do not accept the derivation. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | is similar to an oath “to do evil, or to do good” | Shevuot 26a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yishmael understands that liability is extended to one whose oath <b>is similar to an oath “to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>He whose prohibition is due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3), is liable, as liability for an oath about the future entails breaking one’s word. <b>Excluded is that</b> oath <b>whose prohibition is not due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the verse<b>: “You shall not lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), since liability for an oath about the past applies when the oath itself was a lie. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | The Sages taught | Shevuot 26a:14 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it is hidden from him; and, when he knows of it, be guilty in one of these things” (Leviticus 5:4). The phrase <b>“a man…with an oath”</b> serves <b>to exclude a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> from liability to bring an offering. The term <b>“and it is hidden”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> from liability one who broke his oath <b>intentionally,</b> as he does not deserve to be able to achieve atonement through bringing an offering. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | to do evil, or to do good” | Shevuot 26a:2 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to an oath on an utterance: From the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply? The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips,”</b> which includes other matters. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” | Shevuot 26a:3 | <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the future. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the past? The verse</b> subsequently <b>states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> referring exclusively to oaths <b>about the future.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:4 | “Or if anyone take an oath | Shevuot 26a:7 | <b>What</b> is the specific instance in this context where one finds <b>that Rabbi Akiva interprets</b> with <b>amplifications and restrictions?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“Or if anyone take an oath</b> clearly with his lips” (Leviticus 5:4), it <b>amplifies</b> the range of possible oaths for which one could be liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance. When the verse continues: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> it <b>restricts</b> that range. When it further continues: <b>“Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” it <b>then amplifies</b> again. According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter that was excluded by the restriction. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | a generalization and a detail: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips” | Shevuot 26a:9 | <b>And Rabbi Yishmael interprets</b> the verse following the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), is <b>a generalization; “to do evil, or to do good,”</b> is <b>a detail; “whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” the verse <b>then</b> further <b>generalized.</b> There is a hermeneutical principle that when a verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and</b> another <b>generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail</b> in the verse is <b>explicitly</b> an oath referring <b>to the future, so too, all</b> the oaths for which one is liable must be referring <b>to the future.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:4 | The verse states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall express with an oath” | Shevuot 26b:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that one takes an oath <b>“with his lips,” but not with his heart. From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who decided in his heart</b> to take an oath is liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance? <b>The verse states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall express with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). |
| Leviticus 5:4 | shall express | Shevuot 26b:12 | <b>Rav Sheshet said: This</b> is <b>not difficult; this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One takes an oath <b>“with his lips” and</b> does <b>not</b> take an oath <b>when he</b> merely <b>decided in his heart to express with his lips but has not</b> yet actually <b>expressed</b> the oath verbally. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one who <b>simply decided in his heart</b> to take an oath without the intention of stating it with his lips is liable? <b>The verse states: “Whatsoever it be that</b> a man <b>shall express</b> with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4). |
| Leviticus 5:4 | clearly with his lips | Shevuot 26b:9 | § <b>Shmuel says:</b> Even after one <b>decided</b> to take an oath, he <b>needs to express</b> it <b>with his lips</b> for it to take effect, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath <b>clearly with his lips</b> to do evil, or to do good” (Leviticus 5:4). |
| Leviticus 5:4 | the verse states: “To do evil, or to do good” | Shevuot 27a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that when <b>one takes an oath to refrain</b> from performing <b>a mitzva and he does not refrain, he would be liable</b> to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “To do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Just as doing good</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action, <b>so too, doing evil</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action. <b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> from liability one who <b>takes an oath to refrain from</b> performing <b>a mitzva and does not refrain,</b> so <b>that he is exempt</b> from bringing the offering. |
| Leviticus 5:4 | or | Shevuot 34a:4 | § After presenting the different proofs cited in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara proceeds to analyze the opinions cited therein, beginning with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer that one derives that one is liable for an oath of testimony only if it involves a monetary claim from the case of an oath on a deposit based on multiple instances of the term “or” that appear in both contexts, and there is an oath with those multiple instances of the term “or” and there is no priest in their context. <b>Rabba bar Ulla objects to this:</b> The multiple instances of the term “or” in the verse: <b>“Or</b> if any one shall take an oath to clearly express with his lips to do evil <b>or</b> to do good” (Leviticus 5:4), which is written with regard to an oath on <b>an utterance, will prove</b> that one is liable even without a monetary claim, <b>as they are</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or,” and there is an oath in their</b> context, <b>and there is no priest in their</b> context, <b>and they are not speaking with regard to a monetary claim.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:4 | “utterance of lips” | Shevuot 7a:1 | <b>one can bring a sliding-scale</b> offering for the unwitting violation of a transgression whose intentional violation is not punishable by <i>karet</i>; <b>just as is</b> the case of a violation <b>for “hearing the voice”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), which is where a litigant asks a witness to testify about an event and he takes a false oath that he did not witness the event, <b>and for</b> taking a false oath with the <b>“utterance of lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). In both of these cases, an intentional violation is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, and nevertheless one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for an unwitting violation. |
| Leviticus 5:5 | “And it shall be when he shall be guilty of one of these matters” | Horayot 8b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili?</b> It is as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a sliding-scale offering: <b>“And it shall be when he shall be guilty of one of these matters”</b> (Leviticus 5:5), indicating that <b>anyone who becomes liable in</b> every <b>one</b> of the instances for which one brings a sliding-scale offering <b>becomes liable in all of</b> those instances; <b>and anyone who does not become liable in</b> every <b>one</b> of the instances to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>does not become liable in any of</b> those instances. Since the king is exempt from taking an oath of testimony, he is exempt in the other cases as well. |
| Leviticus 5:5 | a sliding-scale offering: “And it shall be when he shall be guilty of one of these matters” | Horayot 8b:6 | <b>And just as with regard to</b> a transgression performed by the general <b>public</b> the liability is to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering, so too, a provisional guilt-offering comes only for uncertainty</b> with regard to a transgression that renders one obligated to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering.</b> This is the source for the fact that there is no liability to bring a sin-offering if the general public defiles the Temple or its sacrificial foods, and individuals are not liable to bring a provisional guilt-offering for those transgressions. The Sages <b>say: If so,</b> and the derivation is based on that term, this is difficult, as <b>isn’t it also written</b> with regard to <b>a sliding-scale offering: “And it shall be when he shall be guilty of one of these matters”</b> (Leviticus 5:5)? The Gemara responds: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of <b>“they are guilty” from</b> the meaning of <b>“he is guilty,” but one does not derive</b> the meaning of <b>“he is guilty” from</b> the meaning of <b>“he shall be guilty,”</b> even though both are stated in the singular. |
| Leviticus 5:5 | “And it shall be when he shall be guilty of one of these matters” | Horayot 9a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> and the verse is interpreted in that manner, then that <b>which is written</b> there: <b>“And it shall be when he shall be guilty of one of these matters”</b> (Leviticus 5:5), <b>so too</b> shall be interpreted: <b>Anyone who becomes liable in</b> every <b>one</b> of the instances for which one brings a sliding-scale offering <b>can become liable in any of</b> those instances, <b>and</b> anyone <b>who does not become liable in</b> every <b>one</b> of the instances to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>cannot become liable in any of</b> those instances. <b>Why,</b> then, did <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The <b>king is liable</b> in all of these cases <b>except for</b> the case of <b>hearing of a voice,</b> indicating that he can become liable in the rest of the instances even if he is exempt in one? |
| Leviticus 5:5 | “Of one” | Horayot 9a:7 | <b>Abaye and Rava both say</b> to resolve this difficulty: Rabbi Akiva <b>learns</b> this inference from the term: <b>“From one”</b> (Leviticus 5:13). <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the term: <b>“Of one”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about the term <b>“from one” that he learns</b> a <i>halakha</i> from it? |
| Leviticus 5:5 | in one of these things” | Shevuot 25b:14 | Abaye <b>said to them: You cannot say</b> that one who takes a false oath of testimony is liable to bring <b>two</b> offerings, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the sliding-scale offering that is brought for both an oath of testimony and an oath on an utterance: The verse states: “And it shall be, when he shall be guilty <b>in one of these things”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). By inference, <b>for one</b> of the sins that render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>you may deem him liable, but you may not deem him liable</b> for <b>two.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:5 | in one of these | Shevuot 25b:18 | Abaye <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>Is this not what they said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse about the sliding-scale offering: “When he shall be guilty <b>in one of these</b> things” (Leviticus 5:5)? By inference, <b>for one</b> of the sins that render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>you may deem him liable, but you may not deem him liable</b> for <b>two? And</b> since one does not bring an offering for an intentional false oath on an utterance, <b>if</b> the verse is referring to a case where he <b>intentionally</b> took a false oath of testimony, <b>how could there be</b> a case where one is liable to bring <b>two</b> offerings such that this case needs to be excluded? Consequently, the verse must be referring to a case where he took the oath unwittingly, and it teaches that nevertheless, one brings only one offering for each violation. |
| Leviticus 5:5 | of any one | Shevuot 32a:14 | Abaye said to Rav Pappa: That should <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “And it will be when he is guilty <b>of any one</b> of these” (Leviticus 5:5), serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every</b> instance when one repeatedly performs the transgressions for which one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that one is liable only for an oath taken <b>in court, is one liable for each and every</b> oath? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If <b>he administered an oath to them five times before the court, and they denied</b> knowledge of any testimony relating to the incident, <b>they are liable</b> for taking <b>only one</b> false oath. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Since</b> once they denied that they had any knowledge of the matter <b>they can no</b> longer <b>retract</b> that denial <b>and admit</b> that they have knowledge of the matter. Abaye explains: <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that one is liable for each and every <b>oath</b> taken <b>outside court;</b> but one is liable only if the <b>denial</b> is <b>in court?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:5 | “And it shall be when he will be guilty of one of these” | Shevuot 33b:14 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it is written with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And it shall be when he will be guilty of one of these”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). The term “of these” is a restrictive expression from which it is derived: <b>There are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is liable and there are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is exempt. How so?</b> If the plaintiff <b>demanded</b> testimony from the witness with regard to <b>a monetary</b> claim, the witness is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath; if the plaintiff demanded testimony from the witness with regard to <b>another matter,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:5 | “And it shall be when he will be guilty of one of these” | Shevuot 34a:9 | § <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it is written with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And it shall be when he will be guilty of one of these”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). The term “of these” is a restrictive expression from which it is derived: <b>There are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is liable and there are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is exempt. How so?</b> If the plaintiff <b>demanded</b> testimony from the witness with regard to <b>a monetary</b> claim, the witness is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath; if the plaintiff <b>demanded</b> testimony from the witness with regard to <b>another matter,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:6 | “sin” | Chagigah 10b:13 | <b>Rava said: And what is</b> the logical <b>difficulty</b> with this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Perhaps</b> the transgression of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is different, as it is derived</b> through a verbal analogy from the parallel term <b>“sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:6) and <b>“sin”</b> (Numbers 18:9), <b>from</b> the case of <b><i>teruma</i>: Just as there,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>, the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself,</b> and therefore the agent may separate <i>teruma</i> on behalf of the owner of the produce, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to misuse of consecrated property, the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself,</b> which means that when the agent properly performs his agency the owner is liable. |
| Leviticus 5:6 | from his sin” | Keritot 27b:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> that are mentioned in the mishna derived? The Gemara answers that they are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the sliding-scale offering: It is written with regard to one who brings a lamb for his obligation: “And the priest shall make atonement for him <b>from his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:6); and it is written with regard to one who brings a bird: “And the priest shall make atonement for him <b>from his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:10); and it is written with regard to one who brings one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour: <b>“Over his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:13). <b>What</b> is the meaning of these phrases that <b>the verse states?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:6 | from his sin [ al ḥattato ] | Menachot 101a:16 | The reason for this is <b>that the Torah stated</b> with regard to an extremely destitute individual who brings a tenth of an ephah of fine flour: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him <b>for his sin [<i>meḥattato</i>]</b> that he has sinned of one of these, and it shall be forgiven for him” (Leviticus 5:13). By contrast, with regard to a wealthy person who brings a lamb as a sliding-scale offering, the verse states: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him <b>from his sin [<i>al ḥattato</i>]</b> that he has sinned” (Leviticus 5:6). The word “<i>al</i>,” which can also mean on, indicates that if an extremely destitute individual designates a tenth of an ephah for his meal offering and then becomes wealthy, he redeems his meal offering and adds money on to the original sum in order to purchase an offering that is appropriate for his current financial status. In that case, the meal offering is redeemed even if it is pure. |
| Leviticus 5:7 | “And if his means suffice not” | Horayot 9a:1 | <b>“And if his means suffice not”</b> (Leviticus 5:7), <b>and it is stated: “And if his means not suffice”</b> (Leviticus 5:11), indicating that the sliding-scale offering applies only to <b>one who can come to</b> a state of <b>poverty and wealth.</b> This serves to <b>exclude a king and an anointed</b> priest, <b>who cannot come to</b> a state of <b>poverty.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:7 | everywhere | Keritot 28a:28 | Similarly, <b>doves precede pigeons</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “And he shall bring his guilt offering…two doves, or two pigeons” (Leviticus 5:7). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> doves <b>are more select than</b> pigeons. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 12:6), with the usual order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:8 | adjacent to its oref ” | Chullin 19b:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement in the mishna: One who slaughters an animal from the <i>oref</i>, its slaughter is not valid, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oref</i>? If we say</b> that the reference is to the <b>actual occipital bone</b> at the rear of the skull, <b>why</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply <b>specifically</b> to one who <b>slaughters</b> from the <i>oref</i>? <b>Even</b> if one <b>pinches</b> a bird offering from the <i>oref</i> it would <b>also</b> not be valid, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Pinch off its head <b>adjacent to its <i>oref</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:8), at the nape beneath the occipital bone, <b>and not its <i>oref</i>. Rather, what</b> is the <b><i>oref</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? It is <b>adjacent to the <i>oref</i>,</b> the back of the neck below the occipital bone, <b>as it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>The entire nape is valid for pinching.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:8 | adjacent to its nape | Chullin 21b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: “According to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), which is written with regard to the sliding-scale bird sin offering, means <b>according to the ordinance of the bird sin offering</b> mentioned in the previous verse. <b>Just as a bird sin offering</b> is pinched <b>adjacent to its nape</b> (Leviticus 5:8), beneath the occipital bone, <b>so too a bird burnt offering</b> is pinched <b>adjacent to its nape,</b> beneath the occipital bone. |
| Leviticus 5:8 | from pinching | Chullin 22a:12 | It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yishmael derived from the term “according to the ordinance” that is written with regard to the bird burnt offering that the pinching of the bird burnt offering is performed at the nape of the neck, as it is in a bird sin offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who derive other matters from that term, <b>from where do they derive</b> that pinching of the bird burnt offering is performed at the nape of the neck? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive pinching</b> that is written with regard to the burnt offering: “And pinch off its head” (Leviticus 1:15), <b>from pinching</b> that is written with regard to the sin offering: “And pinch off its head adjacent to its neck” (Leviticus 5:8). |
| Leviticus 5:8 | “And pinch off its head adjacent to its nape, but shall not divide it asunder” | Chullin 27b:5 | The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> so, say, based on the same juxtaposition: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of a bird, the pinching is performed <b>adjacent to</b> the <b>nape</b> of the neck, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to an animal, the slaughter is performed <b>adjacent to</b> the <b>nape</b> of the neck and not from the throat. The Gemara explains that therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a bird: <b>“And pinch off its head adjacent to its nape, but shall not divide it asunder”</b> (Leviticus 5:8), from which it is derived: <b>Its head,</b> i.e., the bird’s head, is pinched <b>adjacent</b> to the <b>nape, but the head of another,</b> the animal, <b>is not</b> cut <b>adjacent</b> to the <b>nape.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:8 | “And he shall sacrifice that which is for the sin-offering first” | Horayot 13a:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>A bull for an unwitting communal sin precedes a bull for idol worship. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>This,</b> i.e., the bull for an unwitting communal sin, is <b>a sin-offering, and that,</b> i.e., the bull for idol worship, is <b>a burnt-offering, and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall sacrifice that which is for the sin-offering first”</b> (Leviticus 5:8); <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the sin</b>-<b>offering will be first, it is already stated: “And the second he shall prepare as a burnt-offering according to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10). <b>Rather, this established a paradigm</b> from which all similar cases may be derived, teaching <b>that all sin-offerings precede the burnt-offerings that accompany them, and we maintain that even bird sin-offerings precede animal burnt-offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:8 | and he shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first | Pesachim 59a:17 | <b>And if you say,</b> in an attempt to answer as before, <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> here is dealing with a situation in which he already <b>offered his burnt-offering; may his burnt-offering be brought before his sin-offering? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written concerning one who entered the Temple or ate consecrated food while ritually impure: “And he shall bring them to the priest <b>and he shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first</b> and pinch off its neck close by its head, but shall not divide it” (Leviticus 5:8). To <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state</b> that the sin-offering is first? <b>If it is to teach that</b> this sin-offering <b>should</b> be offered <b>prior to the burnt-offering, it is already stated: “And he shall offer the second as a burnt-offering according to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), and there is no need for two verses. |
| Leviticus 5:8 | “And pinch off | Zevachim 65a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states that the priest shall <b>“pinch off</b> its head,” which must be performed <b>at the nape. Do you say</b> that the pinching occurs <b>at the nape, or</b> is it <b>only at the throat? It</b> can be derived through <b>a logical inference:</b> It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And pinch off</b> its head” (Leviticus 1:15), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there,</b> with regard to a bird sin offering: <b>“And pinch off</b> its head opposite its nape, but shall not separate it” (Leviticus 5:8). <b>Just as there,</b> the head is pinched <b>at the nape, so too here,</b> the head is pinched <b>at the nape.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:8 | shall not separate it” | Zevachim 65b:10 | The Gemara relates that the Rabbis <b>said this</b> dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> concerning the reason for the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>said: Have they not heard that which Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat, in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, used to say: I heard that one may</b> completely <b>separate</b> the head of <b>a bird sin offering</b> from its body. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the verse that states: “But <b>shall not separate it”</b> (Leviticus 5:8)? |
| Leviticus 5:8 | shall not separate it” | Zevachim 66a:3 | Consequently, it is obvious that whereas the priest must completely separate the head of a bird burnt offering, this is not the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a sin offering. <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to state with regard to a bird sin offering: “But <b>shall not separate it”</b> (Leviticus 5:8)? <b>Conclude from</b> this verse that it is not forbidden to separate the head of a bird sin offering from the body, but rather <b>one does not have to separate</b> it. |
| Leviticus 5:8 | “And he shall offer that which is for the sin offering first” | Zevachim 90a:13 | § The mishna states: The sacrifice of <b>the bird sin offering precedes</b> the sacrifice of the bird burnt offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the bird sin offering and the bird burnt offering that a poor sinner sacrifices instead of an animal sin offering. The verse states: <b>“And he shall offer that which is for the sin offering first”</b> (Leviticus 5:8). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this in order <b>to teach that</b> the sin offering <b>is sacrificed first, as</b> it <b>is already stated: “And he shall prepare the second for a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:10). |
| Leviticus 5:9 | and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar, it is a sin offering” | Meilah 8b:9 | The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the statement of Rav Huna. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a verse in the Torah: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; <b>and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar, it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:9). <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava,</b> who holds that the squeezing out of the blood is essential, <b>this is as it is written: “And the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out</b> at the base of the altar, it <b>is a sin offering.”</b> This clause indicates that only after the blood has been squeezed out is it considered a valid sin offering. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, what</b> does the verse mean when it states: <b>“The remainder</b> of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar, it is a sin offering”? |
| Leviticus 5:9 | “And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out | Zevachim 37a:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that all</b> the <b>blood</b> that is left over from an offering after the requisite placement <b>requires placement of blood on the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured</b> upon the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> this <b>from</b> the verse cited <b>by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> with regard to a verse discussing a bird sin offering: <b>“And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out</b> at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “of the blood,”</b> because the entire verse is talking about the blood, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “of the blood”?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:9 | The verse states: “And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out | Zevachim 37a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since we</b> have <b>learned only about</b> those offerings whose blood is <b>placed</b> on the altar with <b>four placements,</b> i.e., outer sin offerings, <b>that they require placement of the</b> leftover <b>blood on the base</b> of the altar, <b>from where</b> is it derived that the same applies to the leftover <b>blood</b> of all the <b>other</b> offerings? <b>The verse states: “And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out</b> at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9). <b>Since</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “of the blood,”</b> because the entire verse is talking about the blood, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “of the blood”?</b> This <b>teaches that all the</b> leftover <b>blood</b> from all the offerings <b>requires placement of blood on the base</b> of the altar. |
| Leviticus 5:9 | and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out | Zevachim 52a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>Rabbi Yishmael hold</b> that failure to <b>squeeze out</b> the blood of <b>a bird sin offering disqualifies</b> the offering, as Rav Pappa explained? <b>But the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; <b>and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out</b> at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9). This means: <b>And the remainder shall be squeezed out,</b> i.e., it needs to be squeezed out only if some blood remains. |
| Leviticus 5:9 | not effect atonement, | Zevachim 52b:4 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> it would seem there <b>is a logical inference</b> to counter this logic. <b>It is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is to be sprinkled <b>above</b> the red line, referring to the blood of an animal sin offering, which is to be sprinkled on the corners on the upper half of the altar, <b>and it is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is to be sprinkled <b>below</b> the red line, referring to the blood of a bird sin offering, which is to be sprinkled on the lower half of the altar. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood</b> about <b>which</b> it <b>is stated</b> that it is to be <b>below</b> the red line, if it is a case <b>where one placed</b> it <b>above</b> the red line, it does <b>not effect atonement,</b> as the Sages derived from the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9), <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>blood,</b> about <b>which</b> it <b>is stated</b> that it is to be <b>above</b> the red line, if it is a case <b>where one placed</b> it <b>below</b> the red line, it does <b>not effect atonement.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:9 | but did not squeeze out | Zevachim 63b:10 | The Gemara notes: <b>We learn</b> in this mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a bird sin offering: If the priest <b>pinched its</b> nape <b>in any place on the altar,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> If <b>he sprinkled its blood in any place</b> on the altar, it is <b>valid.</b> If <b>he sprinkled</b> the blood, <b>but did not squeeze out</b> the remaining blood upon the lower part of the wall of the altar, in accordance with the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offer-ing upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 5:9), it is nevertheless <b>valid, provided that he places</b> some <b>of the blood of the soul</b> anywhere on the altar <b>from the red line and below.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:9 | “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering | Zevachim 64b:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bird sin offering: <b>“And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering</b> upon the side of the altar” (Leviticus 5:9). This teaches that the blood is sprinkled directly <b>from the body of the sin offering,</b> not with the priest’s finger or from a vessel. <b>How so?</b> The priest <b>holds the head and the body and sprinkles</b> its blood <b>on the wall of the altar. And</b> he does <b>not</b> sprinkle it <b>on the wall of the ramp, and not on the wall of</b> the <b>Sanctuary, and not on the wall of</b> the <b>Entrance Hall. And which</b> is this wall of the altar that the blood is sprinkled on? <b>This is the lower wall,</b> below the red line. |
| Leviticus 5:9 | the verse states: “And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out [ yimmatze ] at the base of the altar” | Zevachim 64b:8 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out [<i>yimmatze</i>] at the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 5:9), which teaches that the priest sprinkles the blood on the <b>wall where its remaining</b> blood <b>drains to the base</b> of the altar. <b>And which</b> wall is this? <b>This is the lower wall.</b> The surrounding ledge of the altar is located one cubit above the red line, and any blood sprinkled above this ledge will not drip down to the base of the altar. The verse teaches that the blood is sprinkled on the wall of the altar from which it would drip down to the altar’s base unimpeded. |
| Leviticus 5:10 | “And he shall prepare the second as a burnt offering, according to the ordinance” | Chullin 21a:15 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The dispute is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a sliding-scale offering, in which a poor person who cannot afford an animal sin offering brings two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, it is written: <b>“And he shall prepare the second as a burnt offering, according to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), which means <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering</b> in whose stead the offering was brought. |
| Leviticus 5:10 | Rabbi Yishmael says: “According to the ordinance” | Chullin 21b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: “According to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), which is written with regard to the sliding-scale bird sin offering, means <b>according to the ordinance of the bird sin offering</b> mentioned in the previous verse. <b>Just as a bird sin offering</b> is pinched <b>adjacent to its nape</b> (Leviticus 5:8), beneath the occipital bone, <b>so too a bird burnt offering</b> is pinched <b>adjacent to its nape,</b> beneath the occipital bone. |

The verse states: <b>“And he shall offer that which is for the sin offering first”</b> (Leviticus 5:8). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this in order <b>to teach that</b> the sin offering <b>is sacrificed first, as</b> it <b>is already stated: “And he shall prepare the second for a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:10). |
| Leviticus 5:11 | and it is stated: “And if his means not suffice” | Horayot 9a:1 | <b>“And if his means suffice not”</b> (Leviticus 5:7), <b>and it is stated: “And if his means not suffice”</b> (Leviticus 5:11), indicating that the sliding-scale offering applies only to <b>one who can come to</b> a state of <b>poverty and wealth.</b> This serves to <b>exclude a king and an anointed</b> priest, <b>who cannot come to</b> a state of <b>poverty.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:11 | the meal offering of a sinner, | Menachot 108a:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which is also brought from a tenth of an ephah of fine flour (Leviticus 5:11). |
| Leviticus 5:11 | he shall put no oil upon it, nor shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering” | Menachot 108a:19 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a sinner’s meal offering: The verse states: “But if his means are not sufficient for two doves or two pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; <b>he shall put no oil upon it, nor shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11). <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that the phrase “it is a sin offering” is interpreted as a restriction: <b>It is called a sin offering, and no other</b> meal offering <b>is called a sin offering.</b> This <b>taught that with regard to the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest, it is not called a sin offering, and</b> consequently it <b>requires frankincense.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:11 | “He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it” | Menachot 23a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the meal offering of a sinner: <b>“He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it”</b> (Leviticus 5:11)? How, then, can any oil be added? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse teaches <b>that one should not designate oil for it as</b> one designates oil for the <b>other</b> meal offerings, but the meal offering of a sinner is not rendered unfit by the addition of a small amount of oil. |
| Leviticus 5:11 | “It.” | Menachot 4a:16 | The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a sin offering, what is the reason</b> that it is disqualified when sacrificed not for its own sake? It is <b>because it is written with regard to</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> in a verse discussing the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). This indicates that a sin offering is valid only when it is sacrificed for its own sake. <b>So too, it is written with regard to them,</b> i.e., the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy: <b>“It.”</b> In the case of the meal offering of a sinner the verse states: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), and with regard to the meal offering of jealousy it is written: “It is a meal offering of jealousy” (Numbers 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:11 | require neither oil nor frankincense. | Menachot 59a:5 | <b>The two loaves</b> brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> (see Leviticus 23:17), <b>the meal offering of a sinner, and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>require neither oil nor frankincense.</b> The two loaves do not require oil or frankincense because these additions are not mentioned with regard to it. The meal offering of a sinner does not require them, as it is written: “He shall not put oil upon it, neither shall he give any frankincense upon it; for it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11). With regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>, it is similarly written: “He shall pour no oil upon it, nor give frankincense upon it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance” (Numbers 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:11 | the Merciful One calls it “a sin offering” | Menachot 59b:17 | <b>Abaye says:</b> Even though the meal offering is disqualified while there is frankincense on it, nevertheless <b>the Merciful One calls it “a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11) even in that state, and therefore the improper intent has an effect with regard to it. <b>Rava said</b> there is a different explanation: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian, who does not</b> subscribe to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rejection,</b> but holds that a sacrifice that was rejected temporarily is not rejected entirely. |
| Leviticus 5:11 | “He shall place | Menachot 59b:22 | § The Gemara continues to discuss the placement of oil upon the meal offering of a sinner or the meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed any amount</b> of <b>oil on top of an olive-bulk</b> of <b>a meal offering</b> of a sinner, he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The verse states: <b>“He shall place</b> no oil upon it” (Leviticus 5:11). This indicates an act of <b>placing</b> that has no minimum amount, and therefore one is liable for <b>any</b> amount of oil. When the verse states <b>“upon it,”</b> this teaches that a meal offering is disqualified by the oil <b>only if it has</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk. |
| Leviticus 5:11 | It is written: “Neither shall he give | Menachot 59b:23 | <b>And Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed an olive-bulk of frankincense on top of any amount</b> of <b>a meal offering,</b> he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is written: “Neither shall he give</b> any frankincense upon it” (Leviticus 5:11), which indicates that frankincense disqualifies the meal offering <b>only if there is</b> at least an amount that constitutes <b>giving,</b> which is an olive-bulk. When the verse states <b>“upon it,”</b> |
| Leviticus 5:11 | The Sages taught | Menachot 59b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the meal offering of a sinner is disqualified if oil is placed upon it, but if frankincense is placed upon it he should gather and remove the frankincense. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “He shall place no oil upon it, neither shall he give any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11). The phrase <b>“he shall place no oil upon it”</b> teaches that one may not place oil on the meal offering of a sinner, <b>and</b> that <b>if</b> he did <b>place</b> oil on this meal offering he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> it. |
| Leviticus 5:11 | which the Merciful One states: “He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; | Sotah 15a:7 | § The mishna states: <b>All</b> other <b>meal-offerings</b> require oil and frankincense. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do <b>all</b> other <b>meal-offerings</b> actually <b>require oil and frankincense? But isn’t there the meal-offering of a sinner,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon;</b> for it is a sin-offering” (Leviticus 5:11). |
| Leviticus 5:11 | “it” is also written with regard to the meal offering of a sinner, | Zevachim 11a:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse comes mainly to</b> teach <b>that which Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> explained. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that a meal offering of a sinner</b> whose handful was removed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit is</b> due to <b>another reason: What is the reason a sin offering</b> sacrificed not for its sake is disqualified? The reason is <b>that</b> the word <b>“it” is written with regard to it</b> in the verse: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). Since the word <b>“it” is also written with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> in the verse: “For it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), the same applies in that case. |
| Leviticus 5:11 | “He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it; for it is a sin offering” | Zevachim 63b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks a question about the mishna’s statement that the sacrificial rite of a bird sin offering is performed at the southwest corner of the altar: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: The verse states</b> with regard to the sin offering of a destitute sinner, which is a meal offering brought in lieu of an animal or bird: <b>“He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it; for it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11). From this verse it is evident that <b>a sin offering is called a meal offering and a meal offering is called a sin offering,</b> so that their <i>halakhot</i> may be compared. |
| Leviticus 5:12 | priesthood, | Menachot 10b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rava says</b> with regard to the superfluous terms in the passage discussing a leper: One derives a verbal analogy between the word <b>“hand”</b> written in that passage and the word <b>“hand”</b> written <b>with regard to the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, to indicate that the latter must also be performed with the right hand, <b>why do I</b> need this verbal analogy? One can <b>derive</b> that the handful must be removed with the right hand <b>from</b> the verse’s mention of the <b>priesthood,</b> as it is stated: “And the priest shall remove his handful” (Leviticus 5:12). |
| Leviticus 5:13 | “And the priest shall atone for him for his sin that he has committed from one of these” | Horayot 9a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>when the Merciful One excludes</b> an anointed priest, it is particularly <b>from</b> the type of sliding-scale offering brought due to <b>extreme poverty? And what is it?</b> The <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering mentioned in the verse. <b>But the Merciful One did not exclude him</b> from the dove brought as a sliding-scale offering due to <b>poverty</b> and the sheep brought as a sliding-scale offering by one with <b>wealth.</b> The Gemara rejects this: That <b>should not enter your mind, as it is written</b> with regard to the sliding-scale offering: <b>“And the priest shall atone for him for his sin that he has committed from one of these”</b> (Leviticus 5:13), from which it is derived: <b>One who gains atonement with</b> every <b>one</b> of the types of a sliding-scale offering <b>gains atonement with any of</b> the types of the sliding-scale offering, <b>and one who</b> does <b>not gain atonement with</b> every <b>one</b> of the types of a sliding-scale offering does <b>not gain atonement with any of</b> the types of the sliding-scale offering. |
| Leviticus 5:13 | “From one” | Horayot 9a:7 | <b>Abaye and Rava both say</b> to resolve this difficulty: Rabbi Akiva <b>learns</b> this inference from the term: <b>“From one”</b> (Leviticus 5:13). <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the term: <b>“Of one”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about the term <b>“from one” that he learns</b> a <i>halakha</i> from it? |
| Leviticus 5:13 | “Over his sin” | Keritot 27b:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> that are mentioned in the mishna derived? The Gemara answers that they are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the sliding-scale offering: It is written with regard to one who brings a lamb for his obligation: “And the priest shall make atonement for him <b>from his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:6); and it is written with regard to one who brings a bird: “And the priest shall make atonement for him <b>from his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:10); and it is written with regard to one who brings one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour: <b>“Over his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:13). <b>What</b> is the meaning of these phrases that <b>the verse states?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:13 | for his sin [ meḥattato ] | Menachot 101a:16 | The reason for this is <b>that the Torah stated</b> with regard to an extremely destitute individual who brings a tenth of an ephah of fine flour: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him <b>for his sin [<i>meḥattato</i>]</b> that he has sinned of one of these, and it shall be forgiven for him” (Leviticus 5:13). By contrast, with regard to a wealthy person who brings a lamb as a sliding-scale offering, the verse states: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him <b>from his sin [<i>al ḥattato</i>]</b> that he has sinned” (Leviticus 5:6). The word “<i>al</i>,” which can also mean on, indicates that if an extremely destitute individual designates a tenth of an ephah for his meal offering and then becomes wealthy, he redeems his meal offering and adds money on to the original sum in order to purchase an offering that is appropriate for his current financial status. In that case, the meal offering is redeemed even if it is pure. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | me’ila before sin: | Bava Batra88b:9 | <b>And Rabbi Levi says: Robbing an ordinary</b> person <b>is more severe than robbing the Most High,</b> i.e., taking consecrated property. <b>As</b> with regard to <b>this</b> regular robber, the verse states <b>“sin” before “<i>me’ila</i>”:</b> “If any one sin, and commit a trespass [<i>me’ila</i>] against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that</b> one who misuses consecrated items, the verse states <b><i>me’ila</i> before sin:</b> “If any one engages in misuse [<i>timol ma’al</i>] and sins unwittingly” (Leviticus 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:15 | shekels” | Keritot 10b:10 | <b>From where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> derived? It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the <b>ram</b> brought in its second year as <b>a guilt offering</b> must be “according to your valuation in <b>silver</b> by <b>shekels”</b> (Leviticus 5:15), i.e., it must be worth two <i>sela</i>. It may therefore be understood <b>by inference that a lamb,</b> i.e., a young ram, <b>in its</b> first <b>year is</b> worth <b>one <i>sela</i>.</b> And it is known that a lamb is brought when it is within its first year, <b>as it is written: “A lamb of the first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (8a): The price of <b>nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds brought by an impoverished person instead of a lamb, <b>stood that day at one-quarter</b> of a silver dinar. A quarter-dinar is one-sixteenth of a <i>sela</i>, the price of a lamb. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | commits a misuse [ tim’ol ma’al ]” | Keritot 18b:17 | The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “If anyone <b>commits a misuse [<i>tim’ol ma’al</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 5:15). The double verb [<i>tim’ol ma’al</i>] <b>extended</b> the obligation to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property to a case where the value of individual instances of misuse at different times amount to a total of one <i>peruta</i>. Rava concludes his objection: <b>But why</b> should that be the <i>halakha</i> according to Abaye, who maintains that knowledge of uncertainty, and similarly the day of Yom Kippur, which has the same effect as a provisional guilt offering, divides his actions into separate entities? When the second misuse occurs after Yom Kippur, <b>isn’t his</b> sin <b>atoned</b> for <b>by Yom Kippur?</b> Since his acts of possible transgression are divided, how can they combine to the value of one <i>peruta</i>? |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “your valuation” | Keritot 22b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who expounds</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering,”</b> as Rabbi Akiva derives from here that a provisional guilt offering must be worth at least two silver shekels. <b>But according to the one who does not expound</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering,” what is there to say?</b> From where does he derive that all guilt offerings must have the same minimum value? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“your valuation”</b> stated with regard to other guilt offerings (see Leviticus 5:18, 5:25), and the identical term <b>“your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 5:15) <b>from</b> the case of <b>a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property, which the verse indicates must be worth at least two silver shekels. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “ram” | Keritot 22b:19 | The Gemara asks: What is the source of this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>guilt offering</b> for engaging in intercourse with <b>an espoused maidservant, about which</b> the term <b>“your valuation”</b> is <b>not written</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers: <b>We derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“ram”</b> (Leviticus 5:15) in the verse about a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property and the word <b>“ram”</b> (Leviticus 19:21) in a verse concerning the espoused maidservant. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “Silver by shekels” | Keritot 27a:22 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma:</b> If the price of <b>lambs depreciated in the world</b> and one cannot find a ram valued at two <i>sela</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>we require</b> an offering that fulfills the condition: <b>“Your choice vows”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:11), <b>and that</b> requirement <b>is</b> fulfilled, as he is bringing the best animal available? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> a guilt offering to be purchased in accordance with the verse: <b>“Silver by shekels”</b> (Leviticus 5:15), i.e., two <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> that requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “sin” from teruma , | Kiddushin 42b:9 | The Gemara answers: The case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is different, as</b> it <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy of <b>“sin”</b> in this case and <b>“sin” from <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the verse states: “And sin through error” (Leviticus 5:15), with regard to misuse of consecrated property, and it states: “Lest they bear sin for it” (Leviticus 22:9) with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>Just as</b> with <b><i>teruma</i></b> one can <b>appoint an agent, so too</b> with <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property one can <b>appoint an agent,</b> although the latter is a transgression. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | misuse by Torah law. | Meilah 12a:10 | § <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Sacrificial</b> animals <b>that died</b> without being sacrificed <b>are excluded from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse by Torah law.</b> This is because they are no longer fit to be sacrificed, and therefore are no longer in the category of: “The sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). They cannot be redeemed either, since one may not redeem sacrificial animals merely in order to feed them to the dogs. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | the school of Rabbi Yannai says as follows: From this verse: | Meilah 15a:13 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous version of Rabbi Yannai’s opinion, and states that in fact he maintains that animals consecrated for sacrifice on the altar are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse by Torah law. As <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai says as follows: From this verse:</b> “If anyone commit a misuse, and sin through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15), <b>we learn</b> that items <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance</b> are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. But <b>we do not learn</b> from this verse that animals consecrated for the <b>altar</b> are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. Instead, that <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: “And if a man eat of the sacred items through error” (Leviticus 22:14), which is referring to all sacred items, or from the verse (Leviticus 3:16): “All the fat is the Lord’s.” |
| Leviticus 5:15 | that the verse states: “If anyone commit a misuse, and sin through error, in the sacred items of the Lord, | Meilah 15a:4 | § The mishna teaches that items consecrated for Temple maintenance are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. <b>Rabbi Yannai said: It is clear</b> that one is <b>liable for misuse</b> by Torah law <b>only for</b> items <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance and a burnt offering alone. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states: “If anyone commit a misuse, and sin through error, in the sacred items of the Lord,</b> then he shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your valuation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary, for a guilt offering” (Leviticus 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:15 | anyone | Meilah 18a:13 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to misuse of consecrated property, the verse states: “If <b>anyone</b> commits a misuse, and sins through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). It is derived from the general term “anyone” that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>whether</b> the guilty person is a common <b>individual, and whether</b> he is <b>the king, and whether</b> he is <b>the anointed</b> High Priest. Although in other contexts they have obligations to bring different offerings, these individuals have a uniform liability with regard to the sin of misuse. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | commits a misuse [ ma’al ], | Meilah 18a:14 | The <i>baraita</i> further interprets the verse: “If anyone <b>commits a misuse [<i>ma’al</i>],</b> and sins” (Leviticus 5:15). The term <b><i>ma’al</i> means nothing other than deviation</b> from the norm. <b>And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to a woman suspected of adultery: <b>“If any man’s wife goes aside, and acts unfaithfully [<i>ma’al</i>] against him”</b> (Numbers 5:12). <b>And</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“And they broke faith [<i>vayimalu</i>] with the God of</b> |
| Leviticus 5:15 | and sins | Meilah 18b:4 | The <i>halakha</i> in these cases is derived from the fact that <b>the verse states:</b> “If anyone commits a misuse, <b>and sins</b> through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). The word <b>“sin” is stated with regard to <i>teruma</i>,</b> in the verse: “And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, as you have set apart from it its best” (Numbers 18:32); <b>and “sin” is</b> also <b>stated with regard to misuse</b> of consecrated property. Several <i>halakhot</i> are derived from this verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | anyone | Meilah 19a:4 | The Gemara analyzes the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: The verse states: “If <b>anyone</b> commits a misuse” (Leviticus 5:15). All people <b>are included</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>whether</b> the guilty person is <b>the</b> common <b>individual, and whether</b> he is <b>the king, and whether</b> he is <b>the anointed</b> High Priest. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>might</b> one have thought? It is <b>obvious</b> that the king and the High Priest are included, as <b>it is written: “Anyone.”</b> |
| Leviticus 5:15 | offerings of the most sacred order. | Meilah 3b:8 | § With regard to the misuse of offerings that were rendered unfit, <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav said: Sprinkling</b> the blood of <b>an offering</b> with <b>the intent to consume it after its appointed time [<i>piggul</i>],</b> in a case where there was <i>piggul</i> intent during the slaughter as well, <b>does not remove</b> the meat of the offering <b>from</b> the status of being subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse, in</b> the case of <b>offerings of the most sacred order.</b> The reason is that its meat is still classified as “the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15), since there was no proper sprinkling that permitted the priests to partake of the offering, as it is <i>piggul</i>. Similarly, this sprinkling <b>does not bring</b> the sacrificial portions <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity into</b> the status of being subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse,</b> as only a valid sprinkling confers that status. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | with regard to sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity. | Menachot 47b:11 | Rav explains: The <i>halakha</i> that it <b>does not cause</b> items <b>to</b> become subject to the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property applies <b>with regard to sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> The prohibition against misusing consecrated property applies to: “The sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). Consequently, it does not apply to offerings of lesser sanctity, as the meat is the property of those who brought the offering, and the sacrificial portions are disqualified by the sprinkling performed with improper intent. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | As it was taught | Pesachim 32b:10 | The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Pappa</b> himself <b>also retracted</b> this explanation. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “If any one commits a trespass, and sins through error, in the sacred items of the Lord, then he shall bring his guilt-offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your valuation in silver shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-offering” (Leviticus 5:15), the <i>baraita</i> explains: The phrase <b>“and sins through error” excludes one who</b> sins <b>intentionally</b> through misuse of consecrated property. Could this <b>not</b> be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference,</b> as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>other mitzvot for which one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> the verse <b>exempts one</b> from bringing an offering when the transgression was committed <b>intentionally, is it not right that</b> with regard to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>which does not</b> incur the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> it should <b>exempt one who acts intentionally?</b> |
| Leviticus 5:15 | with regard to teruma . | Pesachim 33a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? From where does he derive his opinion? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: He derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>sin</b> stated with regard to misuse of consecrated items and the word <b>sin</b> stated <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>.</b> With regard to misuse of consecrated items, the verse states: “If any one commits a trespass, and sins through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15); with regard to <i>teruma</i>, the verse states: “Lest they bear sin for it, and die due to it, if they profane it” (Leviticus 22:9). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi makes the following comparison: <b>Just as</b> eating <b><i>teruma</i></b> is punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>so too, misusing</b> consecrated items is punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | from misuse | Shevuot 34b:16 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>he should have derived</b> it <b>from</b> the case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>as</b> that is a derivation of <b>misuse</b> written with regard to an oath on a deposit: “If any one shall sin and commits an act of misuse and dealt falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit” (Leviticus 5:21), which is derived <b>from misuse</b> written with regard to misuse of consecrated property: “If any one commits an act of misuse and sinned unwittingly from items consecrated to the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “If anyone commit a trespass, and sin through error, in the holy items of the Lord” | Temurah 32b:4 | The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that liability for misuse in the case of dedications to priests is derived from the term “is most holy,” then consider <b>that which Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse are</b> written <b>explicitly in the Torah only</b> in the case <b>of</b> one who misuses <b>a burnt offering, as it is stated</b> with regard to the guilt offering brought for misuse: <b>“If anyone commit a trespass, and sin through error, in the holy items of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:15). The verse indicates only that one is liable for misuse of burnt offerings, which are <b>exclusively for the Lord. But</b> the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse apply to <b>a sin offering or a guilt offering,</b> from which the priests or owners partake, <b>is derived only from that</b> which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi taught. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “If anyone commit a trespass, and sin through error, | Temurah 3a:4 | <b>What is the reason</b> that one is not liable for misuse? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to misuse of consecrated property: <b>“If anyone commit a trespass, and sin through error,</b> in the holy items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). <b>And we derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the use of the word <b>“sin”</b> in this verse and the word <b>“sin”</b> used in the context of <b><i>teruma</i>:</b> “They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it” (Leviticus 22:9). <b>And with regard to <i>teruma</i> it is written</b> explicitly: “Even of all the hallowed items of <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 18:8), from which one can infer: <b>But not</b> of <b>gentiles.</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of misuse as well, therefore, do not apply to animals consecrated by gentiles. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | teruma . | Zevachim 45a:7 | The Gemara’s explanation continues: <b>But</b> if one derived benefit from them, he is <b>not</b> liable after the fact for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property through a verbal analogy between <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to misuse of consecrated items and the word <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> With regard to misuse of consecrated property, the verse states: “If any one commits a trespass, and sins through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). In the case of <i>teruma</i>, the verse states: “Lest they bear sin for it, and die due to it, if they profane it” (Leviticus 22:9). And <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, it is written:</b> “And they shall not profane the sacred items of <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:15), which indicates: <b>But not</b> the sacred items of <b>gentiles,</b> i.e., one is not liable for partaking of the <i>teruma</i> of gentiles while he is in a state of ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 5:15 | “according to your valuation” | Zevachim 48a:17 | The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> according to <b>one who holds</b> that there is a derivation from the word <b>“law,”</b> but according to the <b>one who does not hold</b> that there is a derivation from the word <b>“law,” from where does he learn</b> that all guilt offerings must have the same minimum value? The Gemara answers: <b>He learns</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property (Leviticus 5:15) and the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> stated with regard to a provisional guilt offering (Leviticus 5:18) and a guilt offering for robbery (Leviticus 5:25). |
| Leviticus 5:16 | The verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering [ ha’asham ], and he shall be forgiven” | Bava Kamma111a:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering [<i>ha’asham</i>], and he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 5:16). The <i>baraita</i> interprets the phrase: “The ram of the guilt-offering,” to be referring to two entities: The ram, i.e., the offering, and the payment, represented by the words “the guilt-offering”; this teaches that forgiveness and atonement are achieved only after both the ram of the guilt-offering is sacrificed and the restitution of the monetary payment is given. |
| Leviticus 5:16 | “And he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the sacred matter” | Bava Metzia55a:19 | § With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> raised in the previous discussion, the Gemara elaborates. <b>Rav Ketina says: The court attends to</b> monetary claims of <b>even less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>. Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the sacred matter”</b> (Leviticus 5:16). |
| Leviticus 5:16 | which is written: “And he shall pay for that which [ asher ] he has sinned from the sacred item” | Horayot 10b:3 | <b>Rava, son of Rabba, objects to this: If that is so,</b> and the term <i>asher</i> is interpreted in that manner, then concerning that <b>which is written: “And he shall pay for that which [<i>asher</i>] he has sinned from the sacred item”</b> (Leviticus 5:16), <b>and with regard to Jeroboam, son of Nevat, about whom it is written: “Who [<i>asher</i>] sinned and caused others to sin”</b> (I Kings 14:16), <b>so too</b> is the interpretation <b>that this generation is happy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in the case of a king who brings an offering, it <b>is different, as the verse altered its formulation;</b> in parallel verses, the term “if” is utilized, e.g., in the verse: “If the anointed priest shall sin” (Leviticus 4:3). In the other instances, <i>asher</i> is the standard formulation. |
| Leviticus 5:16 | But isn’t it written: “And he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss with consecrated property, and he shall add to it one-fifth” | Keritot 26b:18 | <b>If we say</b> that the term: His misuse, is referring to the <b>ram</b> that one is obligated to bring as <b>a guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property, is this <b>to say that</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> for misuse of consecrated property <b>is brought together with the ram</b> that he brings as a guilt offering for that sin? If so, then this would explain why if that ram offering is valued as more than two <i>sela</i>, the additional value fulfills the obligation of giving an additional one-fifth. <b>But isn’t it written: “And he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss with consecrated property, and he shall add to it one-fifth”</b> (Leviticus 5:16)? The verse <b>apparently</b> indicates that <b>he brings</b> the additional one-fifth <b>together with</b> his repayment for <b>that which he stole</b> from consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 5:16 | “with the ram” | Zevachim 48a:19 | The Gemara answers that it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“with the ram”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering for mis-use of consecrated property (Leviticus 5:16) and the term <b>“with the ram”</b> stated with regard to the guilt offering for engaging in sexual intercourse with an espoused maidservant (Leviticus 19:22). |
| Leviticus 5:17 | and with regard to a provisional guilt-offering | Horayot 8b:5 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says:</b> The term <b>“and he is guilty” is stated with regard to a sin-offering</b> (Leviticus 4:27) <b>and with regard to a provisional guilt-offering</b> (Leviticus 5:17), <b>and</b> the similar term: <b>“And they are guilty”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), <b>is stated with regard to</b> the general <b>public. Just as</b> the term <b>“and he is guilty”</b> that is stated <b>with regard to an individual</b> is <b>concerning</b> a transgression for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering,</b> as it is written there, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“and they are guilty”</b> that is stated <b>with regard to</b> the general <b>public</b> is <b>concerning</b> a transgression for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed sin-offering.</b> For the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, not a fixed offering. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “And he is guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord” | Horayot 8b:8 | <b>Rav Pappa says: One derives</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), which are written with regard to a provisional guilt-offering, <b>from</b> the meaning of: <b>“And they are guilty,” and: “The commandments of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), which are written with regard to the unwitting communal sin-offering. The phrase: The commandments of the Lord, is not written with regard to the sliding-scale offering. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said to Rav Pappa: Let us derive</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty and bearing of iniquity”</b> (see Leviticus 5:1, 4), <b>from</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is guilty and bearing of iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). |
| Leviticus 5:17 | disagree? | Keritot 17b:7 | The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> matter do Rav Asi and Ḥiyya bar Rav <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: It is stated in a verse discussing the obligation to bring a provisional guilt offering: “And if anyone sin, and do any of the commandments [<i>mitzvot</i>] of the Lord that are not to be done, though does not know it; yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). <b>Rav Asi holds:</b> The <b>tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written <b>is authoritative,</b> and one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the spelling of the words. Therefore, the obligation to bring a provisional guilt offering applies only when there is uncertainty with regard to a single piece, because the word <b>is written</b> as “<b><i>mitzvat</i>,”</b> in the singular form. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | though he does not know it; | Keritot 19b:10 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yehoshua would deem exempt</b> one who does not know the nature of his sin <b>even from</b> bringing <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yehoshua would deem exempt</b> one who does not know the nature of his sin <b>even from</b> bringing <b>a provisional guilt offering, as it is stated:</b> “And <b>if</b> anyone <b>sin,</b> and do any of the commandments of the Lord that are not to be done, <b>though he does not know it;</b> yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). The verse <b>excludes this</b> case, <b>where he knew that he sinned. Rabbi Shimon said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: It can be inferred from <b>this</b> same verse that <b>he does</b> in fact <b>bring a provisional guilt offering.</b> The phrase <b>“and do…though he does not know it”</b> indicates that one brings an offering in a case such as <b>this,</b> when <b>he did not know with which</b> item <b>he sinned.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “And if anyone | Keritot 22b:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the issue of whether one brings a provisional guilt offering for an uncertain misuse of consecrated property, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Immediately following the passage in the Torah discussing a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property the Torah introduces the <i>halakhot</i> of a provisional guilt offering by stating: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin” (Leviticus 5:17). The term “and” serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse</b> of consecrated property; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> in such a case. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “And if anyone | Keritot 22b:10 | <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, as the verse states</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin” (Leviticus 5:17). The term “and” in the form of the letter <b><i>vav</i>, adds to the previous matter.</b> When a sentence begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, it is a continuation of the previous discussion, <b>and</b> therefore the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>earlier</b> passage, in this case misuse of consecrated property, <b>are learned from the later</b> passage. Consequently, one brings a provisional guilt offering even for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “the commandments of | Keritot 22b:13 | Rather, <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>there is no juxtaposition for half</b> of a matter. <b>And here, this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, as they derive</b> from the verbal analogy of the expression <b>“the commandments of</b> the Lord” (Leviticus 5:17) stated with regard to the provisional guilt offering and the identical expression <b>“the commandments of</b> the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27) stated with regard to the sin offering that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. One does not derive the <i>halakhot</i> of the earlier passage based upon the later passage, as this aspect of the comparison has been explicitly <b>excluded from</b> the comparison of these two passages based upon their <b>juxtaposition.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:17 | commandments | Keritot 22b:4 | <b>Rather, here,</b> in the case of one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property, <b>this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing a provisional guilt offering: It is <b>because they derive</b> the details of the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the provisional guilt offering written in the verse: “And if anyone sin, and perform one of all the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 5:17), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse stated with regard to <b>a sin offering:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in his performance of any of the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that may not be performed” (Leviticus 4:27). |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “the commandments of” | Keritot 22b:7 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to the verbal analogy cited above as the source of the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> the following: <b>When we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of provisional guilt offerings based upon the term <b>“the commandments of”</b> used in that context (Leviticus 5:17) and the identical expression <b>“the commandments of”</b> stated with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought for the consumption of forbidden <b>fat</b> (Leviticus 4:27), i.e., a standard sin offering, it is <b>for this</b> purpose <b>that we derive it: Just as there,</b> the verse is referring <b>to a fixed</b> sin offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering, one brings it only for the uncertain transgression <b>of</b> a sin for which one would be liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> offering. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | and he is guilty” | Keritot 25b:3 | <b>Rava said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>those who spoke to</b> Bava ben Buta and said that one may bring a provisional guilt offering for any uncertain sin, not only those stated by the Rabbis? With regard to a provisional guilt offering, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if anyone sins, and does any of the mitzvot of the Lord <b>which may not be done,</b> and he did not know, <b>and he is guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). This indicates that one brings a provisional guilt offering for any form of sin. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” | Kiddushin 81b:7 | <b>In a similar manner, you</b> can <b>say</b> that the same lesson can be derived from the verse: <b>“Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). <b>When Rabbi Akiva came to this verse he would cry.</b> He said: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>one who intended to eat</b> permitted <b>fat, and</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> mistakenly <b>came up in his hand, the Torah states: “Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity,” all the more so</b> is this true for <b>one who intended to eat</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> forbidden <b>fat came up in his hand. Isi ben Yehuda says</b> with regard to the verse <b>“Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”: With regard to this matter all sufferers shall grieve,</b> since the verse teaches that one is punished even for sinning unawares. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | iniquity” | Menachot 4a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering of jealousy is derived from a verbal analogy to a sin offering based on the word “iniquity,” then <b>a guilt offering should</b> also <b>be disqualified</b> if it was sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, as</b> a similar verbal analogy may be <b>derived from</b> the verse that states: “The <b>iniquity [<i>avon</i>]</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> and the verse that states: “And shall bear his <b>iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), in connection with a guilt offering. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “Though he does not know it yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” | Nazir 23a:5 | <b>On a similar note, you</b> can <b>say</b> and quote the following verse with regard to one who is liable to bring an uncertain guilt-offering, which is brought for a possible transgression: <b>“Though he does not know it yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “Though he does not know it yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” | Nazir 23a:7 | <b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that this verse: <b>“Though he does not know it yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), should be explained in a slightly different manner: <b>And if</b> in a case similar to <b>one who intended to pick up the meat of a lamb in his hand and he picked up pork in his hand, e.g.,</b> where there were <b>two pieces</b> before him, <b>one of</b> forbidden <b>fat and one of</b> permitted <b>fat,</b> and he picked up one and ate it without knowing which of them was forbidden, it states with regard to him: <b>“And shall bear his iniquity,”</b> i.e., he is obligated to bring an offering; then with regard to <b>one who intends to pick up pork in his hand and picked up pork in his hand, all the more so</b> is he in need of atonement. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “And if anyone | Zevachim 48a:12 | The Gemara reconsiders: <b>Yes,</b> this <b>is indeed so. And here they disagree with regard to this: Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>it is written</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin, and does any of the commandments which the Lord has commanded not to be done, though he did not know it, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). The word “and” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter.</b> When a phrase begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, it is a continuation of the previous matter, and the <i>halakhot</i> of the previous passage can be learned from the subsequent passage. Therefore one brings a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 5:17 | “And if anyone | Zevachim 48a:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Immediately following the passage in the Torah addressing a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property, the Torah discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of a provisional guilt offering, brought by one who is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering. The verse states: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin, and does any of the commandments which the Lord has commanded not to be done, though he did not know it, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). This serves <b>to render</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse</b> of consecrated property; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> in such a case. The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>we learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the upper passage from the lower passage, <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> in this manner? |
| Leviticus 5:17 | commandments | Zevachim 48a:8 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is not correct, <b>as everyone</b> holds that <b>we learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the upper passage from the lower passage. <b>And this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis</b> exempt from bringing an offering one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property: They learn a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated here:</b> “And if anyone sin, and does any of the <b>commandments</b> which the Lord has commanded not to be done” (Leviticus 5:17). <b>And it is stated with regard to the sin offering for</b> eating forbidden <b>fat:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the <b>commandments</b> which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and be guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). |
| Leviticus 5:18 | “And the priest shall atone for him for his unwitting act that he performed unwittingly” | Horayot 7a:8 | The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the guilt-offering: <b>“And the priest shall atone for him for his unwitting act that he performed unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 5:18), from which it is derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>one whose transgression and his unwitting</b> action <b>are equal,</b> i.e., an ordinary person, whose unwitting act is the very transgression that he performed unwittingly. This serves to <b>exclude an anointed</b> priest, <b>whose unwitting</b> action <b>and his transgression are not equal,</b> as his unwitting act is the erroneous ruling and he is liable to bring an offering only if he performed the transgression on the basis of that ruling. <b>As it is written</b> about the anointed priest: <b>“So as to bring guilt upon the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), indicating that the status of the <b>anointed</b> priest <b>is like</b> that of the general <b>public.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:18 | “And the priest shall atone for him for his unwitting act that he performed unwittingly” | Horayot 8a:1 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And they agree that he does not bring a provisional guilt-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the provisional guilt-offering: <b>“And the priest shall atone for him for his unwitting act that he performed unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 5:18). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis disagree with regard to the interpretation of this verse, in accordance with their opinions. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds:</b> This is referring to <b>one whose sin-offering</b> for <b>all</b> transgressions is <b>for an unwitting</b> act. This serves to <b>exclude that</b> anointed priest, <b>as all of his sin-offerings are not for an unwitting</b> act alone; <b>rather,</b> he brings a sin-offering only if that unwitting act is performed on the basis <b>of absence</b> of awareness <b>of</b> the <b>matter,</b> leading to an erroneous ruling. |
| Leviticus 5:18 | for him concerning the unwitting error which he committed unwittingly | Keritot 18b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda; Rabbi Elazar; and Rabbi Shimon</b> all <b>say:</b> He is obligated to <b>bring only one provisional guilt offering, as it is stated:</b> “And the priest shall make atonement <b>for him concerning the unwitting error which he committed unwittingly</b> and he shall be forgiven” (Leviticus 5:18). It is derived from the verse’s double mention of his unwitting status, for which he is liable to bring one offering, that a person is <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering <b>even for many unwitting sins,</b> despite the fact that he was informed of the uncertainty in between each instance of consumption. |
| Leviticus 5:18 | the verse states: “And he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven” | Keritot 24b:14 | The mishna teaches: With regard to one who brought a provisional guilt offering, if <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> and then he discovered that he did not sin and the meat is intact, <b>the meat may be eaten</b> by the priests. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is the meat eaten? After all, <b>he</b> now <b>has</b> certain <b>knowledge</b> of his sin, and a provisional guilt offering is brought only by one who is uncertain about his sin. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 5:18), <b>and this</b> person <b>did not have knowledge</b> of his sin <b>at the time of forgiveness,</b> i.e., when he achieved atonement, which is the moment of the sprinkling of the blood. |
| Leviticus 5:18 | is no different, | Nazir 23a:11 | <b>And had</b> only <b>these two</b> cases <b>been stated, I would say: It is</b> in <b>these two</b> cases in <b>which atonement and forgiveness are enough for them, as the prohibition is not established;</b> even one who ate the piece that was possibly forbidden fat has not necessarily committed a sin. <b>However,</b> if there were <b>two pieces, one of</b> forbidden <b>fat and one of</b> permitted <b>fat, where the prohibition is established,</b> as there was definitely a forbidden piece before him and nevertheless he proceeded to eat one of them, one might have said that <b>atonement and forgiveness should not suffice for him.</b> Isi ben Yehuda therefore <b>teaches us that</b> there, it <b>is no different,</b> as even this individual is included in the verse: “And he shall be forgiven” (Leviticus 5:18). |
| Leviticus 5:18 | concerning his unwitting transgression wherein he unwittingly transgressed | Shevuot 19b:6 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: He brings only one provisional guilt-offering, as it is stated</b> with regard to a provisional guilt-offering: “He shall bring an unblemished ram…for a guilt-offering…to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him <b>concerning his unwitting transgression wherein he unwittingly transgressed</b> and knew it not” (Leviticus 5:18). This wording teaches that <b>the Torah included many instances of unwitting</b> transgressions <b>in one provisional guilt-offering.</b> One brings one provisional guilt-offering even if he had committed many unwitting transgressions. |
| Leviticus 5:18 | “according to your valuation” | Zevachim 48a:17 | The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> according to <b>one who holds</b> that there is a derivation from the word <b>“law,”</b> but according to the <b>one who does not hold</b> that there is a derivation from the word <b>“law,” from where does he learn</b> that all guilt offerings must have the same minimum value? The Gemara answers: <b>He learns</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property (Leviticus 5:15) and the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> stated with regard to a provisional guilt offering (Leviticus 5:18) and a guilt offering for robbery (Leviticus 5:25). |
| Leviticus 5:19 | not necessary, as it says: “It is a guilt-offering” | Nazir 25a:6 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> In the case of a guilt-offering this exposition is <b>not necessary, as it says: “It is a guilt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:19), from which it may be inferred: <b>It</b> alone <b>shall be</b> sacrificed <b>in its</b> current <b>state,</b> but not its substitute. This <i>baraita</i> explicitly teaches that the surplus money of a sin-offering cannot be used for another offering. Consequently, the money set aside for a nazirite’s sin-offering must be cast into the Dead Sea upon the death of its owner rather than used for a gift offering, even according to the opinion of Reish Lakish. |
| Leviticus 5:19 | not necessary, as it says: “It is a guilt-offering” | Nazir 25b:5 | § The same <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> In the case of a guilt-offering this exposition is <b>not necessary, as it says: “It is a guilt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:19), which indicates: <b>It</b> alone <b>shall be</b> sacrificed <b>in its</b> current <b>state,</b> but not its substitute. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>We learned it</b> as a <b><i>halakha</i>: Any</b> situation <b>that if it were</b> to occur <b>with a sin-offering</b> it would be left to <b>die,</b> if <b>it</b> occurs <b>with a guilt-offering it</b> is left to <b>graze.</b> If so, it is clear that this guilt-offering cannot be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 5:19 | “It is a guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord” | Temurah 17b:17 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>all sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., that their substitutes and offspring are sacrificed upon the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only</b> your holy things,” which, as the Gemara will explain shortly, excludes certain offspring from this principle. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The word “only” <b>is unnecessary,</b> as <b>it states</b> with regard to a guilt offering: <b>“It is a guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:19). The term “It is [<i>hu</i>],” indicates that only <b>it,</b> the guilt offering itself, <b>is sacrificed</b> upon the altar, <b>but its substitute is not sacrificed.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:19 | is unnecessary | Temurah 18a:4 | § The <i>baraita</i> stated that in contrast to Rabbi Yishmael, <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the word “only” <b>is unnecessary</b> to exclude the offspring and substitutes of other sacrificial animals from being sacrificed upon the altar, as the verse that discusses guilt offerings: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 5:19), teaches that only <b>it,</b> the guilt offering itself, <b>is sacrificed, but its substitute is not offered.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? <b>Didn’t</b> the Sages <b>learn this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that the substitute of a guilt offering is left to graze, as a tradition transmitted to Moses from Sinai, since they said that in any case where a sin offering is left to die, in the parallel case involving a guilt offering, the animal is not sacrificed but rather left to graze? |
| Leviticus 5:19 | “It is a guilt offering” | Temurah 23b:15 | <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> who said to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>If so, the teaching of Jehoiada the</b> High <b>Priest</b> has been <b>negated. As it is taught</b> in the aforementioned mishna: <b>This teaching was taught</b> by <b>Jehoiada the</b> High <b>Priest:</b> There is an apparent contradiction in a verse. On the one hand, the verse states: <b>“It is a guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:19), indicating that the meat of this guilt offering is eaten by the priests, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all guilt offerings. On the other hand, the same verse concludes: “He is certainly guilty before the Lord,” which indicates that the <b>entire</b> offering is for God, like a burnt offering. Rather, the verse comes <b>to include</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>anything that comes from surplus</b> funds designated for <b>sin offerings or guilt offerings,</b> those <b>funds</b> should be used <b>to purchase burnt offerings. The meat</b> of these burnt offerings <b>is</b> entirely <b>for God, and the hides</b> are given <b>to the priests,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to burnt offerings. |
| Leviticus 5:19 | “It is a guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord” | Zevachim 103a:12 | <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> said to him: <b>If so, you have nullified the interpretation of Jehoiada the priest. As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:6) that <b>Jehoiada the priest taught this interpretation:</b> The verse states: <b>“It is a guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:19). The phrase “before the Lord” teaches that if <b>any</b> money <b>comes on account of a sin offering or on account of a guilt offering,</b> i.e., it is left over after their purchase, <b>burnt offerings must be purchased with it,</b> and their <b>flesh</b> must be burned on the altar <b>to the Lord.</b> But <b>its hide</b> shall go <b>to the priests.</b> Rabbi Yehuda did not respond, indicating that he conceded that the hides of such offerings go to the priests. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And commits a trespass against the Lord, | Bava Batra123b:10 | The Gemara answers: This is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> such as peace offerings, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says:</b> These sacrificial animals <b>are</b> considered the <b>property of</b> their <b>owners,</b> as opposed to property of Heaven. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“And commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include offerings of lesser sanctity, which are</b> the <b>property of</b> their <b>owners;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Consequently, the firstborn collects a double portion of these as well. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “sin” before “ me’ila ”: | Bava Batra88b:9 | <b>And Rabbi Levi says: Robbing an ordinary</b> person <b>is more severe than robbing the Most High,</b> i.e., taking consecrated property. <b>As</b> with regard to <b>this</b> regular robber, the verse states <b>“sin” before “<i>me’ila</i>”:</b> “If any one sin, and commit a trespass [<i>me’ila</i>] against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that</b> one who misuses consecrated items, the verse states <b><i>me’ila</i> before sin:</b> “If any one engages in misuse [<i>timol ma’al</i>] and sins unwittingly” (Leviticus 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:21 | and commits a trespass against the Lord” | Bava Kamma12b:12 | <b>And Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: The verse states: “A person who sins <b>and commits a trespass against the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include</b> a case in which one denies having in his possession <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, as they are the property of</b> their owners; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement is clearly referring to a time when the Temple is standing, as it is based on a verse that continues to obligate one to bring a guilt-offering. Nevertheless, he states that offerings of lesser sanctity, of which a firstborn is an example, are considered to be the property of their owners even when they are unblemished. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And commits a trespass against the Lord, | Bava Kamma12b:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“And commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include</b> a case in which one denies having in his possession <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, which are property of</b> their owners. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And commits a trespass against the Lord, | Bava Kamma13a:3 | § The Gemara considers <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches: Concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“And commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include</b> a case in which one denies having in his possession <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, which are</b> the <b>property of</b> their owners, and are included in the phrase “and deals falsely with his neighbor.” This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Ben Azzai says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include peace-offerings. Abba Yosei ben Dostai says: Ben Azzai said this only with regard to a firstborn</b> offering. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | or of robbery” | Bava Metzia111a:15 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> with regard to <b>oppression as well,</b> the case can be <b>that</b> he first conceded that he owes the wages <b>and</b> then <b>later denied it.</b> Why does Rav Sheshet say that the case must be where the employer said to the laborer: I gave it to you? The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted, there it is written:</b> “And if he deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, <b>or of robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:21), which <b>by inference</b> indicates <b>that he admitted to him at the outset. But with regard to oppression is it written: Or by oppression? It is written: “Or he oppressed,”</b> which does not refer back to his previous denial but is referring to the actual sin, indicating <b>that he had already oppressed him.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:21 | A verse, as it is written: “And deal falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or oppressed his colleague” | Bava Metzia48a:4 | § <b>Rava says: A verse and a <i>baraita</i> support</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish</b> that money does not effect acquisition of movable property by Torah law. <b>A verse, as it is written: “And deal falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or oppressed his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). The verse is referring to cases similar to a deposit where there is denial of an item and not merely a debt. With regard to the term <b>“pledge,” Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>designated a vessel</b> as collateral <b>for his loan</b> and then denies his debt. With regard to the term <b>“oppressed,” Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the employer <b>designated a vessel for him</b> to guarantee payment of his wages <b>and</b> withheld payment, resulting <b>in his oppression.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:21 | before Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Abba | Bava Metzia58a:12 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which one bears responsibility</b> to replace <b>them are</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation, and</b> those <b>for which one does not bear responsibility</b> to replace <b>them are not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Abba</b> with regard to the source of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. It is derived from the verse: “If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against the Lord, and deals falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or has oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And he commits a trespass against the Lord” | Bekhorot 53b:7 | The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring <b>to offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., peace offerings, <b>and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says: Offerings of lesser sanctity are the monetary property of their owners,</b> and therefore the owner can consecrate them. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the guilt offering of a robber who takes a false oath, that the verse: <b>“And he commits a trespass against the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:21), serves <b>to include</b> one who takes a false oath with regard to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> belonging to another, <b>which are the property of their owners.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Accordingly, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that such animals <b>should be tithed.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the mitzva of animal tithe is not in effect with regard to sacrificial animals at all. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “shall sin,” | Keritot 9a:25 | The mishna teaches that one who falsely takes <b>the oath on a deposit</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“shall sin,”</b> stated with regard to an oath on a deposit (Leviticus 5:21), and the term <b>“shall sin,”</b> stated <b>with regard to the oath of testimony</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is derived from this verbal analogy that just as in the case of the oath of testimony one is liable for committing an intentional transgression in the same manner as an unwitting transgression, the same applies to the oath on a deposit. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And deal falsely | Ketubot 42b:16 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion <b>to them in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis</b> themselves, as follows: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>although he has stood trial, the Merciful One exempts him</b> from the offering, as derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor in a matter of a deposit” (Leviticus 5:21), which indicates that he is liable only for a claim that originally concerned a regular monetary payment. <b>However, according to your</b> opinion, you should <b>at least concede to me</b> in a case <b>where he has not stood trial, that when one claims</b> the money, he <b>claims a fine</b> and not a regular monetary payment. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | and commit a trespass [ ma’ala ma’al ]” | Ketubot 42b:2 | Abaye persists: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> deals <b>with</b> one <b>who has stood trial,</b> it follows that the <b>latter clause also</b> deals <b>with</b> one <b>who has stood trial. As</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in its <b>first clause: I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> for <b>matters for which one pays the principal.</b> With regard to <b>the payments</b> that are <b>double</b> the principal, and <b>payments</b> that are <b>four and five</b> times the principal, and those of <b>the rapist, and the seducer, and the defamer, from where</b> is it derived that all these are included in the liability to bring an offering for falsely taking an oath on a deposit? <b>The verse states:</b> “If anyone sin <b>and commit a trespass [<i>ma’ala ma’al</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). The doubled usage of the word trespass serves to <b>amplify</b> and include any false oath taken in denial of monetary liability. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And deal falsely | Ketubot 42b:6 | <b>And I concede to you,</b> Abaye, <b>with regard to</b> the liability to bring <b>an offering</b> for falsely taking <b>an oath</b> on a deposit, <b>that the Merciful One exempts him</b> from this offering here, <b>based upon</b> the verse <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor in a matter of a deposit,” (Leviticus 5:21), which indicates that one is liable to bring an offering only if he lied about a claim that was originally a monetary obligation. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | and he commits a trespass against the Lord, | Kiddushin 52b:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the obligation to bring an offering for taking a false oath concerning unlawful possession of the property of another: “If any one sin, <b>and he commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). As the verse is discussing property belonging to another, the phrase “a trespass against the Lord” serves <b>to include</b> in the obligation of an offering a false oath with regard to possession of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> of another person, <b>which are the property</b> of the owner; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the portion of an offering of lesser sanctity that the priest receives belongs to him, so he should be able to betroth a woman with it. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “And deals falsely with his colleague | Shevuot 32a:5 | <b>As, if you do not say so</b> and assert that the language of the mishna is precise and one is liable only if the oath was in response to a verbal demand, then as for the mishna (36b), <b>which teaches with regard to a deposit:</b> Liability to bring a guilt-offering for taking a false <b>oath on a deposit, how so?</b> In a case where the owner <b>said to</b> the bailee: <b>Give me</b> the <b>deposit that belongs to me</b> and is <b>in your possession,</b> would you say there, <b>also,</b> that if the owner <b>said</b> this to the bailee, <b>yes,</b> he is liable, and if he <b>did not say</b> this to the bailee, <b>no,</b> he is not liable? <b>But</b> doesn’t the verse <b>“And deals falsely with his colleague</b> in a matter of deposit” (Leviticus 5:21) indicate that the bailee is liable for any denial of the deposit <b>at all,</b> unrelated to the nature of the claim raised by the owner of the item? |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “Shall sin” | Shevuot 34a:3 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath of testimony and states <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy. Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“Shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit: <b>“Shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> concerning an oath on a deposit, the verse <b>is speaking only with regard to a monetary claim, so too here,</b> concerning an oath of testimony, the verse <b>is speaking only with regard to a monetary claim.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:21 | misuse | Shevuot 34b:16 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>he should have derived</b> it <b>from</b> the case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>as</b> that is a derivation of <b>misuse</b> written with regard to an oath on a deposit: “If any one shall sin and commits an act of misuse and dealt falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit” (Leviticus 5:21), which is derived <b>from misuse</b> written with regard to misuse of consecrated property: “If any one commits an act of misuse and sinned unwittingly from items consecrated to the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “shall sin” | Shevuot 35a:8 | <b>Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim. In the case cited in the <i>baraita</i> and in the first clause of the mishna, the plaintiff does not have a legitimate claim. |
| Leviticus 5:21 | “sins” | Sotah 33a:12 | It is stated in the mishna that <b>an oath on a deposit</b> may be taken in any language. This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“sins”</b> (Leviticus 5:21) that appears in the portion of an oath on a deposit, and the word <b>“sins”</b> (Leviticus 5:1) that is mentioned in the portion of <b>an oath of testimony.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:21 | raises an objection | Temurah 8a:14 | § The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one takes an oath falsely denying possession of another’s property, he must pay the value of that property and an additional one-fifth to the owner. The passage stating this <i>halakha</i> begins: “If anyone sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery” (Leviticus 5:21). By stating: <b>“And commit a trespass against the Lord,”</b> the verse serves <b>to include</b> one who denies possession of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> belonging to another, <b>as they are the property of</b> their <b>owner,</b> who has the right to consume their meat after the sacrifice. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:21 | and commit a trespass against the Lord, | Zevachim 114a:3 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the obligation to bring a guilt offering for robbery for taking a false oath concerning unlawful possession of the property of another: “If anyone sin, <b>and commit a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The term “against the Lord” serves <b>to include</b> one who takes an oath with regard to another’s <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, since they</b> are <b>the property of</b> their owner. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:22 | “And swear to a lie” | Bava Kamma105b:20 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment</b> for taking a false <b>oath,</b> i.e., the additional one-fifth payment and the bringing of the offering. The Gemara challenges: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a case <b>where he took an oath, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> teaches a case <b>where he did not take an oath,</b> and the punishment referred to by the <i>baraita</i> is the imposition of liability for accidental damage. <b>As the latter clause teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“And swear to a lie”</b> (Leviticus 5:22), and <b>we learned</b> from this that there is <b>a punishment</b> for taking a false oath. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> itself derived? <b>The verse states: “Nor lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11). <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> teaches the <i>halakha</i> <b>where he took an oath, the first clause</b> must be teaching the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where he did not take an oath.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:22 | “And deals falsely with it” | Bava Kamma105b:7 | <b>Rava sat and said this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that one who protected himself from potential liability for payment by taking a false oath that he is a bailee is liable to pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering. <b>Rav Amram raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning one who is liable for taking a false oath concerning a monetary matter: <b>“And deals falsely with it”</b> (Leviticus 5:22); this serves to <b>exclude one who admits to the primary</b> feature of a claim. |
| Leviticus 5:22 | “And deal falsely therein” | Shevuot 37a:11 | <b>Rav Ḥanina said to Rabba:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports your</b> opinion: The verse states with regard to an oath denying a monetary claim: <b>“And deal falsely therein”</b> (Leviticus 5:22), which serves to <b>exclude one who admits to</b> the truth of the claim of <b>one of</b> a group of <b>brothers or to one of</b> a group of <b>partners,</b> even if he denies the claim to the rest of the brothers or partners. The same verse also states: <b>“And swear to a lie,”</b> which serves to <b>exclude one who borrows</b> money <b>with</b> a promissory <b>note or one who borrows</b> money <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Evidently, one is not liable for taking a false oath concerning a monetary claim when there are witnesses who can testify to it. |
| Leviticus 5:23 | “Robbery,” and “exploitation,” “lost item,” and “deposit” | Bava Kamma104b:12 | The Gemara also proves that the heir must pay the principal from the continuation of the same <i>baraita</i>. <b>And further,</b> it <b>is taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And I</b> would <b>still say: When does</b> the heir <b>pay the principal for his father’s robbery?</b> It is only <b>when he and his father</b> both <b>took</b> false <b>oaths.</b> But if <b>his father</b> took a false oath, <b>and not he;</b> or if <b>he</b> took a false oath, <b>but not his father;</b> or if <b>neither he nor his father</b> took false oaths; <b>from where</b> is the heir’s obligation to pay the principal derived? <b>The verse states</b> the following terms: <b>“Robbery,” and “exploitation,” “lost item,” and “deposit”</b> (Leviticus 5:23); and <b>there is a derivation [<i>yesh talmud</i>]</b> here to derive that the heir is obligated to pay the principal in all of these cases. |
| Leviticus 5:23 | that he has acquired through exploitation” | Bava Kamma104b:9 | But if <b>he</b> took a false oath, <b>but not his father;</b> or if <b>his father</b> took a false oath, <b>but not he;</b> or if <b>he and his father</b> both took false oaths; <b>from where</b> is the heir’s exemption derived? <b>The verse states:</b> “He shall restore the item <b>that he robbed,” and</b> “the item <b>that he has acquired through exploitation”</b> (Leviticus 5:23), <b>and</b> in this case the heir <b>did not rob and did not exploit.</b> Since the verse states the obligation to pay the additional one-fifth payment when discussing one who robbed or exploited another, and the heir has done neither, he is exempt from payment. This <i>baraita</i> states that heirs are not obligated to pay the additional one-fifth payment. |
| Leviticus 5:23 | that he shall restore the item that he robbed” | Bava Kamma112a:12 | After having cited two <i>baraitot</i> that express different opinions with regard to the obligation of heirs to pay for property stolen by their deceased father, the Gemara cites a third <i>baraita</i> that presents both opinions. <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item that he robbed”</b> (Leviticus 5:23); <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “that he robbed”?</b> It means that the robber must <b>return the same</b> item <b>that he robbed.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:23 | that he shall restore the item that he robbed” | Bava Kamma66a:4 | § <b>Rabba said:</b> The principle that <b>a change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it <b>is written</b> in the Torah, <b>and we learned</b> it in a mishna as well. <b>It is written</b> in the Torah: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item that he robbed”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase <b>“that he robbed”?</b> This serves to teach that <b>if</b> the item is the same <b>as</b> it was <b>when he stole</b> it, <b>he must return</b> the stolen item itself. <b>But if</b> it is <b>not</b> the same as it was then, <b>he is required</b> to <b>pay only money,</b> while the stolen item remains his to keep. |
| Leviticus 5:23 | As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery” | Bava Kamma67a:12 | <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the above statement: <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a change</b> in a stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> it? <b>As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23), from which it may be inferred that he must return it <b>in any case,</b> even if it has undergone a change. The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written “that he took by robbery,”</b> which indicates that, on the contrary, the item need be returned only if it is in a similar state to when it was stolen. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase <b>is required</b> to teach another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One adds one-fifth upon</b> returning <b>his own stolen</b> item concerning which he had taken a false oath, <b>but he does not add one-fifth upon</b> returning something <b>stolen by his father.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:23 | As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery” | Bava Kamma67a:9 | <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it? <b>As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase <b>“that he took by robbery”?</b> It teaches that only <b>if</b> the item is in the same state <b>as when he took it by robbery</b> it <b>he must return</b> it. <b>But if not, he is required to pay only money;</b> the stolen item remains his to keep. |
| Leviticus 5:23 | Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law, a stolen item that has changed is returned as is, as it is stated: “And he shall restore that which he took by robbery” | Bava Kamma94b:2 | The Gemara continues the discussion of acquisition of a stolen item due to a change it underwent. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law, a stolen item that has changed is returned as is, as it is stated: “And he shall restore that which he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). This indicates that he shall return it <b>in any case,</b> even if it has been changed. <b>And if you say:</b> In <b>our mishna</b> it is stated that if the stolen item is changed the robber gives monetary compensation rather than returning the item, that policy was instituted by the Sages <b>due to the ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:23 | that he shall restore the item | Bava Kamma98b:11 | The Gemara relates an incident: <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who stated that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ya’akov and not the Rabbis, <b>found Rabba bar Shmuel</b> and <b>said to him: Did you learn anything</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of returning stolen <b>items from which benefit is forbidden?</b> Rabba bar Shmuel <b>said to him: Yes, we learned</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item</b> that he robbed” (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “That he robbed”?</b> It means that the robber must <b>return the same</b> item <b>that he robbed.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:23 | it is written: “And then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing that he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit that was deposited with him” | Bava Metzia48a:5 | <b>And when the verse repeats</b> three of these cases after stating that each individual admitted that he lied and is liable to return the item that he misappropriated, <b>it is written: “And then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing that he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit that was deposited with him”</b> (Leviticus 5:23), <b>while</b> the verse <b>does not repeat</b> the term <b>“pledge.” What is the reason</b> that the verse omits that case? Is it <b>not because it lacks pulling</b> by the lender? Since the lender did not pull the item designated as collateral for the loan, he did not acquire the item and is not liable to bring an offering for taking a false oath if he fails to pay, as he denied owing an abstract debt, not an actual item. Apparently, there is no full-fledged acquisition without pulling the item into one’s possession. |
| Leviticus 5:23 | “And he shall restore the robbed item” | Chullin 141a:19 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught: <b>A thief and a robber are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. A thief violates the prohibition of: “You shall not steal” (Leviticus 19:11), and a robber violates the prohibition of: “You shall not rob” (Leviticus 19:13); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>But here,</b> the prohibition against robbing <b>is a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva, as the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and: <b>“And he shall restore the robbed item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). And nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda deems one liable to receive lashes for transgressing the prohibition against robbing. Therefore, <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:23 | “And he shall return the stolen item” | Makkot 16a:16 | The Gemara questions Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more</b> prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva for which one is flogged? <b>But aren’t there others?</b> Before stating its challenges, the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases that it will cite: <b>Robbery, collateral, and <i>pe’a</i>.</b> The Gemara elaborates: Isn’t there the case of <b>robbery, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and also states: <b>“And he shall return the stolen item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23)? Isn’t there the case of <b>collateral, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not come into his house to fetch his pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), and He then states: <b>“You shall return to him the pledge when the sun sets”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13)? |
| Leviticus 5:23 | that he took by robbery” | Temurah 6a:4 | The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states:</b> “He shall restore the stolen item <b>that he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). This teaches that he must return the original item only if it is still <b>like</b> that <b>which he took by robbery</b> and has not been altered. But in general, transgressions are not effective. |
| Leviticus 5:24 | What is the reason? As the verse states: “Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty” | Bava Kamma103b:12 | Due to these objections, the Gemara offers an alternative explanation. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna here <b>is actually</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, and Rabbi Tarfon concedes</b> that a robber must pay every potential owner in a case <b>where he took</b> a false <b>oath,</b> as is the case in the mishna here. <b>What is the reason? As the verse states: “Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). This verse, which requires one to go to any length to return money owed, is referring specifically to one who takes a false oath concerning his financial obligation. <b>And Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Yevamot</i> that a robber must pay all potential owners <b>even though he did not take</b> a false <b>oath,</b> agrees that the verse is referring specifically to one who takes a false oath, but holds that the Sages <b>penalize</b> the robber by obligating him to pay them all in any event. |
| Leviticus 5:24 | “Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, on the day of his being guilty” | Bava Kamma103b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and when Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the robber is not considered to have returned the stolen item <b>until he pays</b> the value of the <b>stolen item to each and every one</b> of the five, it is only in a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>took</b> a false <b>oath that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>says</b> this. <b>What is the reason? As the verse states</b> with regard to one who takes a false oath concerning a financial obligation: <b>“Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, on the day of his being guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). The <i>halakha</i> that the guilty party must make a rigorous effort to return what he owes is stated in the case of one who took a false oath, and Rabbi Akiva would state his ruling only in that case. |
| Leviticus 5:24 | and shall add the fifth part [ ḥamishitav ] more thereto” | Bava Kamma108a:11 | The Gemara suggests a resolution to Rav Pappa’s dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rava says:</b> The verse states: “Or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full, <b>and shall add the fifth part [<i>ḥamishitav</i>] more thereto”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). By employing a plural term, <i>ḥamishitav</i>, and not the singular <i>ḥamishito</i>, <b>the Torah added many</b> additional <b>one-fifths for one principal,</b> meaning that one can become obligated in multiple one-fifth payments for the same principal. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> Rava’s statement that this is the <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 5:24 | its fifth part | Bava Kamma65b:1 | <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is written concerning a bailee who falsely claims innocence with regard to a deposit entrusted to him: “He shall restore it <b>according to its principal, and</b> shall add <b>its fifth part</b> to it” (Leviticus 5:24). This verse teaches that with regard to <b>monetary restitution that is paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal, one adds one-fifth,</b> but for <b>monetary restitution that is not paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal,</b> as is the case here, where the bailee pays double the principal value, <b>one does not add one-fifth. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> Neither the additional <b>one-fifth nor</b> the <b>guilt-offering is paid in a case where there is double payment.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 5:24 | its fifth part [ ḥamishitav ] | Bava Kamma65b:5 | The Gemara refutes this analysis. <b>Rava said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> could be referring to a case in which <b>initially</b> it was <b>worth four</b> dinars <b>and now,</b> at the time of trial, it is <b>also worth four</b> dinars. <b>And</b> as for <b>what is difficult</b> with this case, namely that <b>the double payment</b> is <b>four</b> dinars <b>and the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> is <b>one dinar,</b> this problem can be resolved as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>took an oath</b> that the deposit was stolen from him, <b>and he again took</b> the same <b>oath,</b> and so on <b>four times, and</b> after each oath <b>he admitted</b> afterward that he had lied. <b>And the Torah said: “And</b> shall add <b>its fifth part [<i>ḥamishitav</i>]</b> to it” (Leviticus 5:24). |
| Leviticus 5:24 | its fifth part | Bava Kamma65b:7 | § <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Sages say:</b> “He shall restore it <b>according to its principal, and</b> shall add <b>its fifth part</b> to it” (Leviticus 5:24). This verse teaches that for <b>monetary restitution that is paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal, one adds one-fifth.</b> But for <b>monetary restitution that is not paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal, one does not add one-fifth.</b> The Gemara infers: He does not add one-fifth, <b>but he</b> is obligated to <b>bring a guilt-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 5:24 | “To whom it appertains shall he give it on the day of his being guilty” | Bava Metzia43b:8 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He pays <b>in accordance with</b> its value at <b>the time of the claim. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. And Rabbi Akiva concedes</b> in a case <b>where there are witnesses</b> to the misappropriation, as in that case the payment is calculated in accordance with the value of the deposit at the time of the misappropriation. <b>What is the reason</b> for that <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>as the verse states</b> concerning, among others, one who misappropriated a deposit: <b>“To whom it appertains shall he give it on the day of his being guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). <b>And</b> in this case, <b>since there are witnesses</b> to the robbery, <b>from that moment he is liable to</b> pay <b>him</b> for his <b>guilt.</b> He is rendered guilty at the moment the witnesses saw him misappropriate the deposit. |
| Leviticus 5:24 | as it is written: “Or anything about which he has taken a false oath” | Bava Metzia48a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does the verse not repeat</b> the case of <b>a pledge? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply that which is stated above,</b> in the first verse cited from Leviticus, to the verse stated <b>below,</b> i.e., the second verse cited from Leviticus? It is derived <b>as it is written: “Or anything about which he has taken a false oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This clause serves <b>to include</b> the case <b>of a pledge in</b> the requirement of <b>return,</b> teaching that even in the case where the debtor designated an item as collateral for a loan, the lender is obligated to return the item although there was no pulling. The Gemara rejects that contention: <b>In any event, the verse did not repeat</b> the case of a pledge <b>explicitly,</b> and one derives support for the opinion of Reish Lakish from that omission. |
| Leviticus 5:25 | “And he shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your valuation” | Arakhin 4a:14 | <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If that is so,</b> that one can expound the term “according to your valuation” in this manner, one could expound similarly <b>with regard to</b> the <b>ram of</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> brought by one who robs and then takes a false oath. <b>As it is written</b> with regard to that offering: <b>“And he shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 5:25). One can argue that <b>so too, anyone</b> who <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations is</b> included <b>in the ram of the guilt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, who are not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations,</b> as stated in the mishna, should also <b>not</b> be included <b>in the ram of the guilt offering.</b> But that is not so, as there is no opinion that exempts them from this offering. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | as Rava says: “The burnt-offering” | Bava Metzia55a:4 | The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rava says: “The burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), employing the definite article, indicates that the reference is to the <b>first burnt-offering. So too,</b> when it is written: <b>The non-kosher</b> animal, the reference is to the <b>initial</b> consecration of the <b>non-kosher</b> animal, not the intermediate stage of consecration. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | the burning of fats and limbs | Berakhot 2a:5 | Rabban Gamliel cites several cases in support of his claim, such as <b>the burning of fats and limbs</b> on the altar. Due to the quantity of offerings each day, the priests were often unable to complete the burning of all of the fats and limbs, so they continued to be burned into the night, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain upon the pyre on the altar all night until morning, while the fire on the altar burns it” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings <b>that are eaten for one day</b> and night; although the Sages state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten <b>until dawn.</b> This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If so, why did the Sages say</b> that they may be eaten only <b>until midnight?</b> This is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression,</b> as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | all night into the morning” | Chagigah 10b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>However, if that is so,</b> this verse indicates that it is only those fats <b>that are brought during a Festival that may not remain overnight.</b> It may be inferred from here <b>that</b> fats which are brought <b>throughout the year may remain all night.</b> But <b>it is written</b> about burnt-offerings: “On its firewood upon the altar <b>all night into the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:2). This shows that burnt-offerings must burn upon the altar all night. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | “This is the law of the burnt-offering, it is | Horayot 3a:1 | <b>“This is the law of the burnt-offering, it is</b> that which goes up on its pyre on the altar” (Leviticus 6:2); <b>these are three exclusionary</b> terms: “This,” “the burnt-offering,” and “it is,” which serve to exclude three offerings concerning which the <i>halakha</i> is that even if they are placed on the altar they are subsequently removed: A burnt-offering slaughtered at night, a burnt-offering whose blood was spilled before it was sprinkled, and a burnt-offering whose blood was taken outside the courtyard. Apparently, it is Rabbi Yehuda who interprets multiple exclusionary terms. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | all night until the morning” | Megillah 21a:3 | It was taught in the mishna: <b>“The entire night is a valid</b> time for <b>reaping the <i>omer</i>,” as the Master said</b> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: The <b>reaping</b> of the <i>omer</i> <b>and the counting</b> of the <i>omer</i> must be performed <b>at night, whereas bringing</b> the <i>omer</i> offering to the Temple must be done <b>during the day. And for burning the fats and limbs</b> of the offerings, it is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to them: “Which shall be burning upon the altar <b>all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:2). |
| Leviticus 6:2 | may bring them up and burn them after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night. | Menachot 26b:12 | <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said to Rava: Your students say</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items whose</b> usual <b>manner</b> is <b>to be sacrificed at night, for example,</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the burnt offering <b>and</b> the <b>fats [<i>pedarim</i>]</b> of the burnt offering, <b>that</b> the priest <b>may bring them up and burn them after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night.</b> This is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering: It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2). |
| Leviticus 6:2 | The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering” | Menachot 26b:14 | The Gemara interjects: Why would they be allowed to be burned after sunset? <b>But didn’t you say</b> that these are items <b>whose</b> usual <b>manner is to be sacrificed during the day?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> the question of the <i>baraita</i> is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these items may be brought up and burned concurrent <b>with the setting of the sun,</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>they are consumed throughout the entire night</b> and not during the day? <b>The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), which <b>included</b> everything that is sacrificed on the altar. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | “This is the law of the burnt offering [ ha’ola ]: | Menachot 49a:1 | The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the phrase: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering [<i>ha’ola</i>]:</b> It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2), a seemingly superfluous general phrase which is interpreted homiletically to <b>include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that any item that ascends [<i>ola</i>] upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. The verse is the actual source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely in support of this ruling. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> does not contradict the opinion of Rav Shimi bar Ashi. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | “This is the law of the burnt offering” | Menachot 6b:15 | The Gemara rejects this: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that any item that ascends upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. In other words, the verse is the source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely as a support for this ruling. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Rabbi Yehuda says: “This is the law of the burnt offering; that is the burnt offering | Niddah 40a:19 | <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, said in the name of Rava:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught which supports</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Rabbi Yehuda says: “This is the law of the burnt offering; that is the burnt offering</b> that goes up on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2). It is derived from this verse that the <i>halakha</i> is that if a part of a disqualified offering is taken up to the altar it should be burned there, rather than taken down, despite its unfit status. <b>There are three</b> expressions which indicate <b>exclusion</b> in this verse: The term “this is,” which indicates this one and not another one; the term “that is,” indicating that one and not another one; and the term “the burnt offering” instead of “a burnt offering.” |
| Leviticus 6:2 | And one | Niddah 41a:6 | <b>And one</b> verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering; that is the burnt offering that goes up on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), teaches <b>with regard to a sacrificial animal that gave birth by caesarean section,</b> that although the offspring is sacred by virtue of its mother’s sanctity, it may not be sacrificed and must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial animals are</b> automatically <b>sacred upon their emergence</b> from the womb. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a firstborn</b> animal that was born by caesarean section, the <i>halakha</i> that this animal is not sacred <b>is derived from</b> the phrase <b>“opens the womb.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:2 | the burnt-offering on the pyre | Sanhedrin 34a:14 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: Any</b> item <b>that is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, e.g., burnt-offerings and the portions of other offerings burned on the altar, <b>if it ascended</b> upon the altar, even if it is disqualified from being sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>, <b>it shall not descend.</b> Since it was sanctified by its ascent upon the altar, it is sacrificed upon it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “It is <b>the burnt-offering on the pyre</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a burnt-offering that is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, <b>if it ascended, it shall not descend, so too</b> with regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, <b>if it ascended, it shall not descend.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:2 | after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night. | Temurah 14a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>And libations, may they be sacrificed at night? Didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items that are normally sacrificed at night, for example, the limbs</b> of a burnt offering <b>and the fats</b> of burnt offerings and other offerings, <b>that one sacrifices</b> them <b>after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night.</b> This is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering: It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2). |
| Leviticus 6:2 | The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering” | Temurah 14a:20 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: But with regard to <b>items that are normally sacrificed in the day, for example the handful</b> of the meal offering, and <b>the frankincense, and the meal offering</b> that accompanies <b>the libations,</b> from where is it derived <b>that one may bring them up</b> and burn them <b>after sunset?</b> The Gemara asks: Would it <b>enter your mind</b> that they may be burned <b>after sunset? But didn’t you say</b> that these are <b>items that are normally sacrificed in the day? Rather,</b> the question of the <i>baraita</i> is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these items may be sacrificed <b>with sunset,</b> i.e., just before sunset, <b>in</b> which case <b>they are consumed throughout the entire night</b> and not during the day? <b>The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), a phrase that <b>included</b> everything sacrificed on the altar. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | all night | Yoma 20a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived that midnight determines the end of the burning period for limbs, after which they assume the legal status of ashes? <b>Rav said: One verse says:</b> “It is the burnt-offering that goes up on its firewood upon the altar <b>all night</b> until morning” (Leviticus 6:2) <b>and he shall burn it,</b> indicating that the sacrificial limbs may be burned throughout the night. <b>And one verse says: “All night…and he shall remove</b> the ashes” (Leviticus 6:2–3), meaning that the ashes may be removed throughout the night. <b>How</b> can these texts be reconciled? Rather, <b>divide</b> the night into two sections: <b>Half of it for burning</b> the limbs, <b>and half of it for removal</b> of the ashes. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | itself shall go up on its bonfire upon the altar all night” | Yoma 33a:5 | The Gemara proceeds to analyze the items listed by Abaye and seeks biblical or logical sources for each. <b>The Master said:</b> Setting up <b>the large arrangement</b> of wood on the altar on which the offerings were burned <b>precedes the second arrangement</b> of wood <b>for incense.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do <b>we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The burnt-offering <b>itself shall go up on its bonfire upon the altar all night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2); <b>this is</b> referring to the <b>large arrangement</b> of wood. <b>“And the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it”</b> (Leviticus 6:2); <b>this is</b> referring to the <b>second arrangement</b> of wood near the corner of the altar, from which coals are taken for the <b>incense.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:2 | The verse states: “It is the burnt-offering on the flame on the altar all night” | Yoma 45a:10 | The Gemara analyzes the different opinions: <b>At any rate, everyone has</b> at least <b>two</b> arrangements in their calculations. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>The verse states: “It is the burnt-offering on the flame on the altar all night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the large arrangement.</b> It states further: <b>“And the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), <b>this</b> additional mention of a fire is referring to <b>the second arrangement,</b> which is <b>for the incense. And from where does Rabbi Yosei</b> learn about the additional arrangement <b>for the upkeep of the fire? He derives it</b> from the verse: <b>“And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), which mentions fire for the third time. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | It is that which goes up [ ha’ola ] | Zevachim 27b:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: We learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as well</b> that if the blood is misapplied on the altar it may not be gathered, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the verse states: <b>“This</b> is the law of the burnt offering: <b>It is that which goes up [<i>ha’ola</i>]</b> on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that a disqualified offering that ascended upon the altar shall not descend from it. <b>These</b> terms, i.e., “this,” “it,” and “that,” <b>are</b> three terms of <b>exclusion,</b> which serve <b>to exclude</b> three cases of disqualified offerings from this <i>halakha</i>: An offering that <b>was slaughtered at night,</b> one <b>whose blood was spilled, and</b> one <b>whose blood emerged outside the curtains,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard. In these cases, even <b>if</b> the offering <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall descend.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:2 | This is the law of the burnt offering: | Zevachim 51a:12 | The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> relied on</b> the verse: “Command Aaron and his sons, saying: <b>This is the law of the burnt offering:</b> It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall thereby be kept burning” (Leviticus 6:2), which <b>amplified</b> it, teaching that many types of disqualified offerings may be left upon the altar. The derivations written in the <i>baraita</i> are mere supports for those <i>halakhot</i>. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | “This is the law of the burnt offering [ ha’ola ]” | Zevachim 68b:12 | The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering [<i>ha’ola</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that any item that ascends [<i>ola</i>] upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. In other words, the verse is the actual source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely in support of this ruling. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | “This is the law of the burnt offering [ ha’ola ]” | Zevachim 69a:22 | The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the phrase: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering [<i>ha’ola</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), a seemingly superfluous general phrase which is interpreted homiletically to <b>include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that any item that ascends [<i>ola</i>] upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. The verse is the actual source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely in support of this ruling. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | as it is stated: “It is the burnt offering on the pyre | Zevachim 83a:16 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: Any</b> item <b>that is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, e.g., burnt offerings and the sacrificial portions of other offerings, which are burned on the altar, <b>if it ascended</b> upon the altar, even if it is disqualified from being sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>, <b>it shall not descend.</b> Since it was sanctified by its ascent upon the altar, it is sacrificed upon it, <b>as it is stated: “It is the burnt offering on the pyre</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering, which is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, <b>if it ascended it shall not descend, so too,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, <b>if it ascended it shall not descend.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:2 | burnt offering: | Zevachim 83b:11 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Whether <b>the offering was fit</b> and the accompanying libations were unfit, or whether the libations were fit and the offering was unfit, and even if both this and that were unfit, the offering shall not descend, but the libations shall descend. The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse that teaches that fit items shall not descend from the altar states: “This is the law of the <b>burnt offering:</b> It is the burnt offering on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2). From there it is derived: <b>Just as a burnt offering,</b> which is an item <b>that comes</b> upon the altar <b>for its own sake,</b> shall not descend, <b>so too, all items that come</b> upon the altar <b>for their own sake</b> shall not descend. <b>Excluded</b> are <b>libations, which come</b> upon the altar <b>for the sake of the offering,</b> not for their own sake; these shall descend. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | the fire | Zevachim 83b:4 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: Any</b> item <b>that is suited to</b> be consumed by <b>the fire</b> on the altar, if it ascended upon the altar it shall not descend, as it is stated: “It is the burnt offering on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that any item suited for burning on the altar shall not descend. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabban Gamliel also,</b> who holds that any item suited for the altar, whether it is to be burned or not, shall not descend, <b>isn’t it written</b> in the verse: <b>“Burnt offering on the pyre”?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes</b> to teach the mitzva <b>to restore</b> to the pyre any parts of the offering that were <b>dislodged</b> from the pyre, and is not discussing unfit items at all. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | that is suited | Zevachim 83b:8 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that is suited</b> to ascend upon the altar, even if it is not typically consumed, if it ascended, it shall not descend, even if it is disqualified from being sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>, as it is stated: “It is the burnt offering on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2). The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehoshua as well, isn’t it written:</b> “Upon the <b>altar,”</b> and not merely: “On the pyre”? The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> term <b>is required</b> by Rabbi Yehoshua to teach: <b>What is the reason the Merciful One states</b> that <b>any</b> item <b>that is suited for the pyre</b> does not descend from the altar? It is because the <b>altar sanctifies</b> it. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | It is the burnt offering | Zevachim 84a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse from which is derived the <i>halakha</i> that items that ascended upon the altar shall not descend, states: <b>“This</b> is the law of the burnt offering: <b>It is the burnt offering</b> on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>These are three</b> terms of <b>exclusion</b> used in the verse: “This,” “it,” and “the,” from which it is derived that three instances are <b>excluded</b> from this <i>halakha</i>: A sacrificial animal <b>that was slaughtered at night, and</b> one <b>whose blood was spilled, and</b> one <b>whose blood emerged outside the curtains,</b> i.e., outside the Temple courtyard. With regard to these cases, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that if</b> one of them <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall descend.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:2 | This is the law of the burnt offering: | Zevachim 84b:10 | The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> relied on</b> the verse: “Command Aaron and his sons, saying: <b>This is the law of the burnt offering:</b> It is the burnt offering on the pyre upon the altar all night until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning there” (Leviticus 6:2), which <b>amplified</b> the application of the <i>halakha</i> stated in the verse, teaching that many types of disqualified offerings may be left upon the altar. The derivations written in the <i>baraita</i> are mere supports for those two <i>halakhot</i>. The explanations cited in the <i>baraita</i> for including these disqualifications are mentioned only to clarify why Rabbi Yehuda does not exclude them based on the terms “this,” “it,” and “that.” |
| Leviticus 6:2 | Rav says: One verse states: All night and he shall burn | Zevachim 86b:2 | <b>Rav says: One verse states: All night and he shall burn</b> the burnt offering, which indicates that there is a mitzva to burn the limbs of a burnt offering all night, as the verse states: “It is the burnt offering on the pyre upon the altar all night until the morning” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And one verse states: “All night</b> until the morning…<b>and he shall remove</b> the ashes that the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:2–3), which indicates that one may remove the ashes at any time during the night, including the limbs of a burnt offering that were already hardened by the fire. How can these texts be reconciled? |
| Leviticus 6:2 | “All night” | Zevachim 86b:5 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The proper time of the removal of the ashes is based on the following: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> it <b>is stated</b> with regard to the burning of the limbs: <b>“All night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), <b>don’t I know that</b> he may burn a burnt offering <b>until the morning?</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Until the morning”?</b> It means: <b>Add</b> another <b>morning to the morning of</b> the <b>night.</b> Arise before dawn, as that is the time for the removal of the ashes. Nevertheless, there is no specific hour fixed for performing this removal, and one may remove the ashes from the beginning of the night. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “He shall put upon his flesh” | Arakhin 3b:11 | <b>And</b> in the case of <b>these priests, since they are not included in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the phylacteries of the <b>arm, as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“He shall put upon his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), which teaches <b>that nothing may interpose between</b> the priestly vestments <b>and his flesh,</b> and therefore he may not wear the phylacteries of the arm, which would interpose, perhaps one would <b>say</b> that priests <b>should also not be obligated in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the phylacteries of the <b>head.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:3 | and he shall put them beside the altar” | Chullin 117a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> such case? <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of the daily <b>removal of the ashes</b> of offerings burned on the altar, <b>the mitzva of which has been performed, and</b> yet one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>as it is written:</b> “And he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, <b>and he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The ashes must be left there, where they are absorbed into the ground, and one who removes and derives benefit from them violates the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property, even though their mitzva has been performed. This contradicts the principle posited above. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | it is written: “And he shall put it” | Chullin 117b:1 | <b>exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” and nothing else. <b>There,</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). This superfluous description teaches that the <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property is in effect even after the performance of a mitzva applies solely to this case and should not be extended to others. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “And he shall put them beside the altar” | Keritot 6a:13 | The Gemara answers: One cannot derive a general principle from this case, <b>because the removal of the ashes and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken,</b> from which one may not derive benefit after that rite has been performed, are <b>two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is</b> the case of <b>the removal of the ashes? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This <b>teaches that they require interment. What is</b> the case of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And they shall break the heifer’s neck in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). This <b>teaches that</b> such heifers <b>require interment.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:3 | misusing | Keritot 6a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why not</b> say that misuse of consecrated property applies to an item whose mitzva has been already performed? <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>the</b> daily <b>removal of the ashes</b> of the offerings from the altar, <b>whose mitzva has been performed,</b> as the offerings have been burnt, <b>and</b> yet one who uses the ashes is liable for <b>misusing</b> the ashes, as derived from the verse: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3). |
| Leviticus 6:3 | it is written: “And he shall put it next to the altar” | Meilah 11b:10 | <b>And there,</b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it next to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that it alone is subject to the prohibition of misuse despite the fact that this is after the fulfillment of its mitzva. The verse emphasizes that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” the ashes, but not to anything else. It is derived from these exclusions that specifically in the case of <b>these, yes,</b> there is misuse after the fulfillment of the mitzva, but with regard to <b>other matters</b> there is <b>no</b> misuse after fulfillment of the mitzva. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “And he shall put it beside the altar” | Meilah 12a:1 | that the ashes of <b>the external altar</b> are subject to misuse, <b>as it is written in</b> the context of those ashes: <b>“And he shall put it beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This teaches that these ashes must be interred, despite the fact that their mitzva has been performed by its removal, and therefore they are subject to misuse. But <b>from where do we</b> derive that the ashes of <b>the inner altar</b> are also subject to misuse? |
| Leviticus 6:3 | matter of the external altar, | Meilah 12a:2 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> in response: It is derived from the fact <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to a bird sacrificed as a burnt offering: <b>“And he shall take away its crop with its feathers,</b> and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes” (Leviticus 1:16), referring to the location for the placement of the removed ashes. <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not needed for</b> the <b>matter of the external altar,</b> as that <i>halakha</i> is already derived from the phrase: “And he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3), <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> the ashes of <b>the inner altar,</b> teaching that these ashes must also be placed there. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar” | Menachot 26b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yannai</b> in fact <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yannai say:</b> In the case of <b>incense that was dislodged from on top of the altar,</b> the priests <b>may not return even small lumps of it</b> to the fire? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Ḥanina bar Minyumi from the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This teaches that if parts <b>of a burnt offering</b> that were partially <b>consumed</b> were dislodged from the external altar <b>you shall return</b> them, <b>but you do not return incense</b> that was partially <b>consumed</b> and was dislodged from the internal altar. The Gemara answers: <b>Remove from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here</b> the word <b>incense,</b> so that it is not included in the list of items that may be burned throughout the night. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | another verse: “That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar” | Menachot 26b:19 | <b>Ḥizkiyya raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>limbs</b> of the burnt offering <b>that</b> a priest <b>arranged</b> on the altar <b>and arranged the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar <b>on top of them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces and the head, and the fat, in order <b>upon the wood</b> that is on the fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8), teaching that they must be placed <b>specifically upon the wood? Or perhaps, since it is written</b> in <b>another verse: “That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that the burnt offering may be arranged directly on the altar, <b>if</b> the priest <b>desires</b> to arrange the limbs in <b>this</b> manner he may <b>do</b> so, <b>and if</b> he <b>desires</b> to arrange them in <b>that</b> manner he may also <b>do</b> so. The Gemara comments: No answer was found, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | and he shall put them beside the altar” | Pesachim 26a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where its mitzva has</b> already <b>been performed,</b> the object <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property? And the</b> daily <b>removal of ashes</b> of the offerings from the altar occurs after <b>its mitzva has been performed, and</b> the ashes are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property, as it is written:</b> “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt-offering on the altar, <b>and he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The Sages derive from the phrase: “And he shall put them” <b>that he</b> may <b>not scatter</b> these ashes; rather, they should be placed gently. <b>“And he shall put them”</b> also indicates <b>that one</b> may <b>not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from these ashes. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | As it was taught | Pesachim 27b:7 | <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> That <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where a fire began on its own among consecrated wood and there is no one who misused consecrated property.</b> Since this is the case, even the ash that is left from this wood remains consecrated property and one may not benefit from it. <b>Rav Shemaya said:</b> This <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with those</b> types of consecrated ash <b>that require burial,</b> such as the ash removed from the altar. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And he shall take up the ash from where the fire has consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put it beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3). The phrase <b>“And he shall put it”</b> indicates that he must do so <b>gently; “and he shall put it”</b> also indicates that he must place <b>all of it; “and he shall put it”</b> also indicates <b>that he</b> may <b>not scatter</b> the ashes. Apparently, even after the offering has been burned it remains sacred, and one may not derive benefit from it. However, when it was burned it was not subject to misuse of consecrated property, as its burning is a necessary step in the process of sacrificing the offerings. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | his linen garment [ middo ]” | Pesachim 65b:4 | The Gemara asks further: <b>But don’t their garments become soiled? And we learned</b> in a mishna: If the priest’s <b>garments were soiled and he performed</b> the Temple <b>rite</b> while wearing them, <b>his rite is invalid,</b> because the priestly garments must be fine and beautiful. <b>And if you say that they raised their garments</b> so that the garments would stay clean, there is a difficulty. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> that explicates the verse: “And the priest shall put on <b>his linen garment [<i>middo</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), that the verse uses the word <b><i>middo</i></b> to teach that the garments must be <b>according to his measure [<i>kemiddato</i>],</b> fitted to his size, <b>not too short and not too long?</b> If the priest raises his garments, they will no longer be exactly his size. The Gemara answers that the priests would walk in the blood <b>while carrying the</b> sacrificial <b>limbs to the ramp</b> of the altar, <b>which is not</b> actually <b>a rite,</b> but only preparation for a rite. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | As it is taught | Temurah 34a:20 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the removal of the ashes: The verse states: “And he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3). The term <b>“and he shall put them”</b> indicates that he shall place them down <b>gently,</b> rather than cast them down. Additionally, the emphasis on “them” in the term <b>“and he shall put them”</b> teaches that he shall put <b>all of them.</b> Finally, it is derived from the superfluous “and” in the term <b>“and he shall put them” that he shall not scatter</b> the ashes. The ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that all of the ashes must be placed in the ground indicates that even after the consecrated item is burned, the ashes remain sanctified and are prohibited. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | upon his flesh” | Yoma 12b:7 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, have learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah says with regard to the removal of the ashes from the altar: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put <b>upon his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The <i>baraita</i> questions the formulation of the verse. Since at the beginning of the verse it is written: “And the priest shall put on,” for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Shall he put upon,”</b> in the latter part of the verse? <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It comes <b>to include</b> donning the <b>mitre</b> and the <b>belt for the removal of the ashes,</b> even though it is not explicitly stated in the verse. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:3 | tanna’im . | Yoma 23b:13 | <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that the Torah states: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh” (Leviticus 6:3). The words “shall he put on” seem superfluous, since these same words were already stated earlier in the verse. Therefore, the Torah could have sufficed with saying: “And linen trousers <b>on his flesh.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Shall he put on”?</b> This extra expression comes <b>to include</b> the donning of the <b>mitre and</b> the <b>belt,</b> which are not mentioned here explicitly, for <b>the removal</b> of the ash; this is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:3 | two garments | Yoma 23b:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason behind</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish?</b> Reish Lakish could have <b>said to you: If it enters your mind</b> that the removal of the ashes <b>is a</b> bona fide Temple <b>service,</b> you are faced with the following difficulty: <b>Do you have</b> any Temple <b>service that may be performed with</b> only <b>two garments</b> rather than the full set of four vestments worn by the priests? In the Torah’s description of the garments worn to remove the ashes it says: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh” (Leviticus 6:3). |
| Leviticus 6:3 | it is stated here: “And he shall take up | Yoma 24a:5 | § <b>Rabbi Avin raised a dilemma: How much</b> ash must be removed in order to fulfill the mitzva of <b>removal of the ashes? Do we derive it from the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> the portion that the Levite sets aside for the priest, in which case one hundredth of the total is separated, <b>or do we derive it from the donations</b> that were set aside from the spoils of the war with <b>Midian, where</b> one five-hundredth was taken from the spoils of war (see Numbers 31:28)? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a teaching with regard to this dilemma. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is stated here: “And he shall take up</b> the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3), <b>and it is said elsewhere,</b> with regard to a meal-offering: <b>“And he shall take up</b> a handful of the choice flour of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:8). <b>Just as there,</b> the amount he removes is <b>a handful</b> of flour, <b>so too, here,</b> he removes <b>a handful</b> of ash. The amount of ashes removed from the altar is therefore not a fixed percentage of the total ash. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | The verse states: “That which the fire will consume of the burnt-offering, on the altar” | Yoma 45b:1 | <b>that they are arranged upon the altar, and if</b> the space on the altar <b>cannot hold them, that they are arranged upon the ramp or upon the ledge</b> that protrudes from the altar, <b>until the large arrangement is made</b> the following day <b>and</b> then <b>they are arranged</b> upon it? <b>The verse states: “That which the fire will consume of the burnt-offering, on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This is taken to mean that those items that the fire already consumed are once again placed upon the altar. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “That which the fire will consume of the burnt-offering on the altar” | Yoma 45b:2 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> expound this verse? He derives from it that if <b>parts of a burnt-offering</b> that were already partially <b>consumed</b> on the altar fell off the altar, <b>you should return them</b> to continue burning; <b>but you do not return incense</b> that was <b>consumed</b> and fell off of the inner incense altar. <b>As Rabbi Ḥananya bar Minyomi from the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which the fire will consume of the burnt-offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This teaches that if <b>parts of a burnt-offering</b> that were partially <b>consumed</b> fell off the altar, <b>you should return them; but you do not return incense</b> that was partially <b>consumed</b> and fell off the altar. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “And he shall put it” | Yoma 60a:5 | The Gemara challenges this reply from a different angle: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common feature to other cases, <b>but according to the one who says that two verses that come as one</b> do <b>teach</b> with regard to other cases, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. With respect to the removal of ashes, it states: <b>“And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), implying “it” and nothing else. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, it is written: <b>“Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), which teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies solely to this case. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | The Sages taught | Zevachim 18b:13 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the priestly vestments that the term: “Linen [<i>bad</i> ]” (Leviticus 6:3), used in the verse indicates several properties of the garments: The verse states <b>“linen”</b> to indicate <b>that they</b> must <b>be</b> made <b>of fine linen [<i>butz</i>]; “linen,” that they</b> must <b>be new; “linen,” that</b> their thread must <b>be twisted</b> of several plies; <b>“linen,” that their thread</b> must <b>be folded six</b> times; <b>“linen,” that</b> the priest may <b>not wear non-sacred</b> clothes along <b>with them.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “Upon his body” | Zevachim 19a:12 | § <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If a gust of <b>wind entered</b> the priest’s <b>vestment,</b> raising it slightly off his body, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we require</b> that the vestment be: <b>“Upon his body”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), in a literal sense, <b>and this</b> is <b>not</b> the case when the wind raises his vestment? <b>Or perhaps</b> the service is valid because <b>this</b> is the normal <b>manner of wearing</b> clothes. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “Shall he put upon his body” | Zevachim 19a:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the phylacteries <b>of the hand</b> that only they interpose? The verse indicates the difference, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the vestments covering the body: <b>“Shall he put upon his body”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating <b>that nothing may interpose between</b> the vestment <b>and his body.</b> The Gemara challenges: But there is <b>also</b> a verse <b>written with regard to the head: “And you shall set the mitre upon his head”</b> (Exodus 29:6), indicating that there must be no interposition between the mitre and the head. If so, the phylacteries of the head should be considered an interposition as well. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | garment [ middo | Zevachim 35a:9 | The Gemara asks further: <b>But don’t their garments become soiled? And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest’s <b>garments were soiled and he performed</b> a Temple <b>rite</b> while wearing them, <b>his rite is disqualified. And if you would say that they raised</b> their garments so that they would stay clean, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And the priest shall put on <b>his</b> linen <b>garment [<i>middo</i></b> <i>vad</i>]” (Leviticus 6:3). The term <i>middo</i>, literally, his measure, teaches that his garment must be <b>according to his measure [<i>kemiddato</i>],</b> i.e., <b>that it should not be</b> too <b>short and that it should not be</b> too <b>long.</b> If the priest raises his garment, it will no longer be exactly his size. The Gemara answers that the priests would walk in the blood only <b>while carrying the</b> sacrificial <b>limbs to the ramp</b> of the altar, <b>which is not</b> actually <b>a rite,</b> but only preparation for a rite. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | it is written: “And he shall put it” | Zevachim 46a:12 | The Gemara answers: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), and this superfluous description teaches that this <i>halakha</i>, that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property is in effect even after the performance of a mitzva, applies solely to this case and should not be extended to others. <b>And there,</b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” and nothing else. |
| Leviticus 6:3 | “That the fire has consumed | Zevachim 83b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>from where does he</b> derive the requirement <b>to restore</b> to the fire sacrificial portions that were <b>dislodged</b> from it? The Gemara responds: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“That the fire has consumed</b> of the burnt offering on the altar” (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that items already partially consumed by the fire are restored to it even if they were dislodged from the pyre. |
| Leviticus 6:4 | outside the camp | Sanhedrin 42b:8 | <b>And when</b> another verse <b>states with regard to</b> the removal of <b>the ash:</b> “And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes <b>outside the camp</b> to a clean place” (Leviticus 6:4), that verse also requires an explanation, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated</b> with regard to the bull brought as a sin-offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out</b> shall it be burned” (Leviticus 4:12). The repetition of “outside the camp” indicates that he is required <b>to give it a third camp,</b> i.e., teaching that it is burned when outside the Israelite camp, corresponding to the land outside Jerusalem’s walls. |
| Leviticus 6:4 | As it is stated: “And he will remove his garments and will don other garments, | Shabbat 114a:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that changing clothes</b> is a display of honor? <b>As it is stated: “And he will remove his garments and will don other garments,</b> and he will bring the ashes outside of the camp to a pure location” (Leviticus 6:4). <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The Torah taught you etiquette. The clothes in which one prepared food for his master, one does not</b> wear <b>to pour his master wine.</b> Since cooking makes one’s clothes dirty, he should wear fresh clothes when serving his master. |
| Leviticus 6:4 | and put on other garments, and carry the ashes out | Yoma 23b:4 | § The Gemara returns to the mitzva of removing the ashes from the altar and associated issues. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states, after describing the removal of the ashes: <b>“And he shall put off</b> his garments, <b>and put on other garments, and carry the ashes out</b> of the camp to a clean place” (Leviticus 6:4). <b>I</b> might <b>understand</b> from here that this change of garments is a mitzva to change into a different kind of garment, <b>similar to</b> the change of garments performed on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> when the High Priest changes back and forth from gold clothes to white clothes. Here, too, the Torah requires <b>that he remove his sacred garments and put on non-sacred garments.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:4 | And when it says: “Outside the camp” | Yoma 68a:8 | <b>And when it says: “Outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 6:4) with regard to removal of the <b>ash,</b> that verse also requires explanation, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it was already stated</b> with regard to the bull sin-offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out</b> shall it be burned” (Leviticus 4:12). Rather the repetition of the words: Outside the camp, indicates that he should <b>give it a third camp,</b> so that it is burned outside of the Israelite camp as well. Consequently, it has been derived that inner sin-offerings are burned outside of the three camps, and when the Torah states: Outside the camp, with regard to the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, it teaches that as soon as they are taken outside the Temple courtyard, the garments of those carrying them are rendered impure. |
| Leviticus 6:4 | outside the camp | Zevachim 105b:16 | And <b>when</b> another verse <b>states with regard to</b> the removal of <b>the ash:</b> “And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes <b>outside the camp</b> to a pure place” (Leviticus 6:4), that verse also requires an explanation, <b>as there is no need</b> for the verse <b>to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated</b> with regard to the bull brought as a sin offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a pure place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). The repetition of “outside the camp” indicates that he is required <b>to give it a third camp,</b> i.e., teaching that it is burned when outside the Israelite camp, corresponding to the land outside the walls of Jerusalem. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it | Bava Kamma111a:13 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that no</b> sacrifice <b>shall precede the daily morning offering? The verse states:</b> “And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood upon it every morning, and <b>he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it</b> and shall cause the fats of the peace-offerings to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). <b>And Rava says: “The burnt-offering,”</b> with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt-offering,</b> i.e., the daily morning offering, which is first both chronologically and in terms of importance. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | “the burnt-offering” | Ketubot 106b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>the remainder itself</b> was used for the Temple vessels, and the phrase “the rest of the money” does not refer to the funds of which there is a remainder, but to the remainder of the donations left in the chamber after the first collection was removed. The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rava said</b> elsewhere, that the phrase <b>“the burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt-offering; so too,</b> the term <b>“the money”</b> (II Chronicles 24:14) is referring to <b>the first money,</b> i.e., the money removed from the collection of the chamber. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | and he shall lay the burnt offering in order on it, | Menachot 49a:24 | <b>What are the circumstances</b> to which the mishna is referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a case where the Temple treasury <b>has</b> all of the animals necessary for both offerings, <b>and</b> the only question is <b>in</b> terms of sacrificing one <b>before</b> the other, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that no</b> sacrifice <b>should precede</b> the sacrifice of the <b>daily offering of morning?</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: It is derived from that which <b>the verse states:</b> “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; <b>and he shall lay the burnt offering in order on it,</b> and shall cause the fats of the peace offering to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). |
| Leviticus 6:5 | upon it” | Pesachim 58a:6 | <b>Therefore, on the rest of the days of the year, when there are</b> many voluntary <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and free-will</b> offerings that must be sacrificed, these offerings are brought after the daily morning offering. <b>As the Merciful One says</b> with regard to the daily offering: “The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it and shall cause <b>the fats of the peace-offerings</b> to go up in smoke <b>upon it”</b> (Leviticus 6:5). |
| Leviticus 6:5 | he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it | Pesachim 58b:11 | As the Gemara mentioned previously that the daily morning offering precedes all other sacrifices, it cites a <i>baraita</i> that explains this law. <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that no</b> sacrifice <b>shall precede the daily morning offering? The verse states:</b> “And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood upon it every morning, and <b>he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it</b> and shall cause the fats of the peace-offerings to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> In other words, how is it derived that the burnt-offering in this verse is referring to the daily morning offering? <b>Rava said: “The burnt-offering,”</b> with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt-offering,</b> i.e., the daily morning offering, which is first both chronologically and in terms of importance. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | it is written: “And he shall burn upon it the fat of the peace-offerings” | Pesachim 59b:6 | <b>Rav Kahana raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Neither may the fat of My festive-offering remain overnight until morning”</b> (Exodus 23:18), which indicates <b>that</b> the fat <b>may not remain overnight</b> and <b>into the morning</b> hours, <b>but it may remain all through the night.</b> However, in another verse <b>it is written: “And he shall burn upon it the fat of the peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), and it is interpreted: <b>Upon it you shall complete all the offerings,</b> which indicates that the fats of all the offerings brought during the day must be burned before the daily afternoon offering. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | and he shall prepare the burnt offering upon it | Tamid 28b:6 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that there is nothing</b> that is sacrificed on the altar <b>prior to the daily morning offering? The verse states:</b> “And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood upon it every morning, <b>and he shall prepare the burnt offering upon it</b> and shall cause the fats of the peace offerings to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). <b>And Rabba says</b> that the term: <b>The burnt offering,</b> with the definite article, indicates that the <b>burnt offering</b> is important and is the <b>first</b> offering sacrificed each day. <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The griddle-cake offering was not burned on the altar at that early hour. Rather, it was necessary to set the preparers of the griddle-cake offering <b>to heat hot water for</b> preparing <b>the parboiled</b> griddle cakes. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | on it” | Yoma 26b:6 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the daily afternoon offering requires</b> that <b>two logs</b> be brought along with it, and that they must be brought <b>by two priests? As it is stated</b> with regard to the burnt-offering: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar <b>and lay out wood</b> [<b><i>etzim</i></b>] in order upon the fire” (Leviticus 1:7). The word <i>etzim</i> is plural, which teaches that two logs are called for. <b>If this is not applicable to the daily morning offering, as it is</b> already <b>written about</b> the morning offering explicitly: <b>“And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and arrange</b> the burnt-offering <b>on it”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), <b>apply it to the daily afternoon offering.</b> The verse therefore teaches us that two logs should be added before that offering. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | peace-offerings” | Yoma 33a:4 | <b>And</b> the <b>libations</b> precede the sacrifice of the <b>additional offerings</b> on days when the additional offerings are sacrificed. <b>And</b> the <b>additional offerings</b> precede the <b>vessels</b> of frankincense that are offered on Shabbat. <b>And</b> the <b>vessels</b> precede the sacrifice of the <b>daily afternoon offering, as it is stated:</b> “And he shall lay out the burnt-offering on it, <b>and burn on it the fat parts of</b> the <b>peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 6:5). The term <b>on it,</b> means <b>complete</b> sacrifice of <b>all other offerings,</b> i.e., after the daily morning offering rather than after the daily afternoon offering. In all cases, the daily afternoon offering is the final offering sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | As it is written: “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning” | Yoma 33a:8 | Abaye continued and said that the <b>second arrangement for incense precedes the setting up of the two logs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do <b>we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:5); there is an obligation to place new logs upon the large arrangement. The term <b>upon it</b> underscores that the wood is placed only on the large arrangement, <b>and not on the other</b> arrangement from which coals are taken for the incense. From the fact that this exclusionary term is necessary, it can be derived <b>by inference</b> that there <b>is another</b> pile on the altar, meaning that when the new logs are placed on the altar, the two arrangements are already there. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | and he shall place the burnt-offering upon it” | Yoma 34a:1 | <b>The verse states:</b> “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning, <b>and he shall place the burnt-offering upon it”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), <b>and Rava said:</b> The verse could have simply said: And he shall place upon it, indicating that everything sacrificed on the altar is placed upon it; but instead, the verse states: “And he shall place <b>the burnt-offering</b> upon it,” to teach that <b>it ascends</b> the altar <b>first.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:5 | “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby” | Yoma 45a:10 | The Gemara analyzes the different opinions: <b>At any rate, everyone has</b> at least <b>two</b> arrangements in their calculations. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>The verse states: “It is the burnt-offering on the flame on the altar all night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the large arrangement.</b> It states further: <b>“And the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), <b>this</b> additional mention of a fire is referring to <b>the second arrangement,</b> which is <b>for the incense. And from where does Rabbi Yosei</b> learn about the additional arrangement <b>for the upkeep of the fire? He derives it</b> from the verse: <b>“And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), which mentions fire for the third time. |
| Leviticus 6:5 | The verse states: “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby” | Yoma 45a:11 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that normally there are only two arrangements, explain this third mention of a fire? <b>That</b> additional mention <b>comes to</b> teach about <b>the kindling</b> of the <b>thin wood chips,</b> which were used to ignite the fires on the altar, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the kindling of the wood chips should</b> be done <b>only at the top of the altar,</b> rather than setting them alight at the bottom of the altar and carrying them up? <b>The verse states: “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), which indicates that the fire that is brought there has to be lit on the altar itself. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an arrangement for the upkeep of the fire is made? The verse states: “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5). |
| Leviticus 6:5 | “And the fire | Yoma 45b:3 | <b>At any rate, everyone</b> assumes there is an additional arrangement of wood <b>that they add on that day,</b> i.e., Yom Kippur, for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies. <b>From where</b> do <b>they</b> derive this? <b>They derive it</b> from the verse <b>“And the fire</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:5). The apparently superfluous words “and the” allude to an additional fire. <b>And even one who does not</b> generally <b>expound</b> the word <b>“and” does expound</b> the phrase <b>“and the.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:5 | the burnt offering | Zevachim 103a:7 | The Gemara answers: According to that opinion, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>as Rava says:</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay <b>the burnt offering</b> in order upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). The verse states: “The burnt offering,” with the definite article, to teach that the daily burnt offering is the <b>first burnt offering</b> sacrificed each day in the Temple. <b>Here too,</b> the verse states: “The priest shall have to himself the hide of <b>the burnt offering</b> which he has offered,” to teach that the priest acquires the hide of <b>a first burnt offering,</b> i.e., an animal that was initially designated as a burnt offering, but not of a burnt offering purchased from proceeds left over from another offering. |
| Leviticus 6:6 | “a perpetual fire” | Yoma 45b:4 | The Gemara notes that there is an additional mention of the altar fire, which has not yet been explained: The phrase <b>“a perpetual fire”</b>(Leviticus 6:6), <b>for what</b> <i>halakha</i> does it <b>come</b> to teach? <b>It is required for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out”</b> (Leviticus 6:6). This <b>teaches about the second arrangement</b> of wood to produce coals <b>for</b> the <b>incense, that it is</b> set up <b>only on the outer altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:6 | The verse states: “A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out” | Yoma 45b:7 | Since there are two equally logical derivations, a verse is required to teach the <i>halakha</i>. <b>The verse states: “A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out”</b> (Leviticus 6:6). The <b>“perpetual fire” that I told you,</b> i.e., the fire of the candelabrum, about which the Torah states “a lamp to burn continually” (Exodus 27:20), <b>should</b> be lit <b>only</b> from a fire that is <b>upon the top of the outer altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:6 | extinguishes | Zevachim 91b:12 | § <b>Shmuel says: One who contributes wine brings</b> it <b>and sprinkles it on the flames</b> of the altar. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states: “And you shall present for the libation half a <i>hin</i> of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:10). The verse indicates that there is a type of wine libation which is an offering made by fire. The Gemara challenges: <b>But he</b> thereby <b>extinguishes</b> the fire on the altar, and the Torah states: “A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out” (Leviticus 6:6). The Gemara explains: <b>Extinguishing in a partial</b> manner <b>is not called extinguishing;</b> in other words, this act is not included in the prohibition. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | Aaron and his sons are written in the passage | Chullin 132a:1 | <b>from your burden [<i>mitunakh</i>],</b> i.e., from that which you raise your objection, I can cite a proof for my practice: With regard to the meal offering of a priest, both <b>Aaron and his sons are written in the passage</b> discussing this offering: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). The verse emphasizes that these <i>halakhot</i> apply only to male priests and not to their daughters. This indicates that when the verse refers merely to priests, even their daughters are included. Accordingly, one may give gifts of the priesthood to the daughter of a priest. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | as it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall bring it near” | Kiddushin 36a:18 | § With regard to <b>bringing near,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall bring it near”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). This teaches that <b>the sons of Aaron</b> bring the meal-offering near, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:7 | “And this is the law of the meal offering: | Menachot 105a:9 | The Gemara explains the dilemma: Perhaps it should be reasoned that <b>since he said: Types,</b> in the plural, apparently <b>he was saying</b> that he intends to bring <b>two</b> meal offerings. <b>And</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the reason he used the singular word: <b>Meal offering?</b> He used it <b>because the entire</b> category of <b>meal offerings is also referred to as: Meal offering,</b> in the singular, <b>as it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And this is the law of the meal offering:</b> The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). |
| Leviticus 6:7 | Where is it repeated? As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord, | Menachot 19b:8 | The Gemara returns to discussing Rav’s statement that a rite is deemed indispensable if it is repeated in the verses. <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: But</b> what of <b>bringing</b> the meal offering to the corner of the altar, <b>which</b> is <b>repeated</b> in <b>the verse,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall bring it to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8); <b>and</b> it is <b>not indispensable,</b> as stated in the mishna (18a)? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Where is it repeated? As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord,</b> in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). |
| Leviticus 6:7 | As it is taught | Menachot 19b:9 | The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is not a repetition of the mitzva for the priest to bring the meal offering to the corner of the altar; rather, it <b>comes</b> only <b>to establish the place for</b> the meal offering and describe where it should be brought. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And this is the law of the meal offering. The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). From the phrase: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the meal offering must be brought <b>on the western</b> side of the altar, which faces the Sanctuary and is therefore “before the Lord.” Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar,”</b> which is its southern side, where the priests ascend the ramp. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | “And this is the law of the meal offering” | Menachot 3b:3 | Rava elaborates: If one removes a handful from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> a different <b>meal offering</b> he fulfills his obligation, as the verse states: <b>“And this is the law of the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). This indicates that there is <b>one law for all the meal offerings,</b> i.e., they are all considered variations of the same offering, and are different only with regard to how they should be sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>. Conversely, if one sacrificed <b>a meal offering for the sake of a slaughtered offering,</b> since the phrase: <b>And this is the law of the meal offering and a slaughtered offering, is not written</b> anywhere, there is no reason to conclude that one fulfills his obligation under such circumstances. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | Or perhaps the reason of Rabbi Shimon is that it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering” | Menachot 4a:2 | <b>Or perhaps the reason of Rabbi Shimon is that it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:7), which indicates that there is one law for all meal offerings. If so, then a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering should be disqualified, since it <b>is not written:</b> And this is the law of the meal offering <b>and a slaughtered offering.</b> Rav Asi <b>said to</b> Rav Hoshaya: <b>Have we ascertained the depth of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon</b> in this matter? In other words, Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is not known. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | “Before the Lord” | Menachot 61a:13 | With regard to the phrase: “A wave offering <b>before the Lord,”</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that this teaches that waving can be performed <b>to the east</b> of the altar, as taught in the mishna. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> of a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier in the tractate (19b) <b>say,</b> concerning a verse discussing the bringing near of a meal offering, which states: <b>“Before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 6:7), that one <b>might</b> have thought one brings it <b>to the west</b> of the altar, as this is the side facing the Sanctuary? That <i>tanna</i> proceeds to explain that the phrase: “In front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7), is a reference to the south, where one ascends the altar, and therefore the meal offering must be brought to the southwest corner. This indicates, though, that the expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the west. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord in front of the altar” | Sotah 14b:13 | The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord in front of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> one <b>might</b> have understood this to mean <b>on the western side</b> of the altar, opposite the Holy of Holies. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar.”</b> This must be the south of the altar, where the ramp is located. <b>If</b> the verse had stated only: <b>In front of the altar,</b> one <b>might</b> have understood it to mean specifically <b>on the southern side.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Before the Lord,”</b> indicating the western side. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The priest <b>brings it near to the southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn. And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:7 | before the Lord, | Zevachim 63b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it must be brought near the altar at the southwest corner? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And this is the law of the meal offering…<b>before the Lord,</b> in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). From the phrase: “Before the Lord,” one <b>might</b> have thought that the rite of bringing the meal offering near the altar must be performed <b>at the west</b> side of the altar, which faces the Sanctuary. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar,”</b> which is its south side, from where the priests ascend the ramp. |
| Leviticus 6:7 | “This is the law of the meal offering” | Zevachim 9b:8 | Rav Mesharshiyya inferred from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason</b> a meal offering satisfies its owner’s obligation even when one removed a handful for the sake of another type of meal offering <b>is that its</b> mode of <b>preparation proves</b> its true nature. <b>But</b> if <b>its</b> mode of <b>preparation does not prove</b> its nature, it does <b>not</b> satisfy its owner’s obligation. <b>Why</b> not? If Mavog’s derivation is correct, <b>let us say</b> likewise that the verse: <b>“This is the law of the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:7), indicates that there is <b>one law for all of the meal offerings,</b> regardless of their mode of preparation. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | as it is written: “And he shall take up from it his handful, of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense | Menachot 106b:19 | The mishna teaches: One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>frankincense, may not</b> bring <b>less than a handful.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And he shall take up from it his handful, of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense</b> which is upon the meal offering, and shall make the memorial part of it smoke upon the altar for an aroma pleasing to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:8). The Torah <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>frankincense with the taking up</b> of a handful <b>of the meal offering.</b> This indicates that <b>just as</b> the <b>taking up from a meal offering</b> is referring to <b>a handful, so too,</b> the minimum size of <b>a frankincense</b> offering is <b>also a handful.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:8 | with his handful [ bekumtzo ]” | Menachot 11a:9 | The Gemara notes <b>that</b> this <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. From the verse that states: “And he shall remove from there <b>his handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), one <b>might</b> have thought that the handful should be <b>overflowing.</b> Therefore, another <b>verse states:</b> “And he shall take up from it <b>with his handful [<i>bekumtzo</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). The prefix that means “with” can also mean: In, indicating that the proper measure of a handful is that which is contained within one’s fingers alone. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | and [ ve’et ] all the frankincense that is upon the meal offering, | Menachot 11b:3 | <b>And</b> all <b>three of them interpret a single verse</b> differently. The verse states: “And he shall take up from there his handful, of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of the oil of it, <b>and [<i>ve’et</i>] all the frankincense that is upon the meal offering,</b> and shall make it smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:8). <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that one may not make the offering smoke upon the altar <b>unless there</b> remains <b>the</b> entire measure of <b>frankincense that was initially fixed together with the meal offering. And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that when the verse states: <b>“All [<i>kol</i>],”</b> it is referring to any part of the frankincense, <b>even a single pinch,</b> as <i>kol</i> can mean any amount (see II Kings 2:4). And when the verse states: <b>“<i>Et</i>,”</b> this serves <b>to includ-e another pinch.</b> Accordingly, at least two pinches must remain to be burned upon the altar. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> interprets the word “all” in the same manner as does Rabbi Yehuda, but he <b>does not interpret</b> and derive a <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“<i>et</i>,”</b> and he therefore holds that only one pinch must remain to be burned. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | that is upon the meal offering” | Menachot 11b:6 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, as with regard to this <i>halakha</i> the verse does not state the term: All, from which one might derive that it is referring to any part of the frankincense? The Gemara explains: This ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since</b> the frankincense in the bowls <b>comes together with bread,</b> i.e., the shewbread, it should be <b>considered as:</b> “Frankincense <b>that is upon the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), and therefore Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon claim that one may sacrifice it even if less than two handfuls remain. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | “with his hand” | Menachot 19b:3 | <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel must agree that <b>wherever the verse repeats</b> a rite it is <b>certainly</b> understood to be <b>indispensable; and here,</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the expressions <b>“his handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2) and <b>“with his hand”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And he shall remove <b>his handful,”</b> and elsewhere it states: “And he shall take up from it <b>with his hand.”</b> The change in terminology between the two verses teaches <b>that</b> the priest <b>should not</b> use a utensil to <b>measure an amount for the handful</b> of a meal offering, but should use his hand. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | “And he shall take up from it | Menachot 24a:9 | The Gemara asks: Since this question was not resolved, <b>what</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall take up from it</b> his handful” (Leviticus 6:8), meaning that he shall take the handful <b>from</b> the meal offering <b>that is connected.</b> This teaches <b>that one shall not bring a tenth</b> of an ephah divided <b>in two vessels and remove the handful</b> from one on behalf of the other. It can therefore be inferred that <b>in</b> the case of <b>one vessel</b> that is <b>similar to two vessels,</b> as the entirety of the meal offering is brought in one vessel although the different parts are not touching, one may <b>remove the handful</b> from one part on behalf of the other part. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | “And all the frankincense which is upon the meal offering” | Menachot 27a:10 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> failure to burn <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the repetition of the mention of the two together in the verse, as it is written: “The priest shall remove of it a handful of its fine flour and of its oil, <b>as well as all of its frankincense”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and again with regard to the meal offering of a sinner it is stated: <b>“And all the frankincense which is upon the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). |
| Leviticus 6:8 | and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering” | Sotah 14b:21 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he gathers its frankincense and puts it on top of</b> the handful. The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take up from his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, <b>and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). |
| Leviticus 6:8 | “And he shall take up | Yoma 24a:5 | § <b>Rabbi Avin raised a dilemma: How much</b> ash must be removed in order to fulfill the mitzva of <b>removal of the ashes? Do we derive it from the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> the portion that the Levite sets aside for the priest, in which case one hundredth of the total is separated, <b>or do we derive it from the donations</b> that were set aside from the spoils of the war with <b>Midian, where</b> one five-hundredth was taken from the spoils of war (see Numbers 31:28)? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a teaching with regard to this dilemma. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is stated here: “And he shall take up</b> the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3), <b>and it is said elsewhere,</b> with regard to a meal-offering: <b>“And he shall take up</b> a handful of the choice flour of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:8). <b>Just as there,</b> the amount he removes is <b>a handful</b> of flour, <b>so too, here,</b> he removes <b>a handful</b> of ash. The amount of ashes removed from the altar is therefore not a fixed percentage of the total ash. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | his handful, | Yoma 47a:14 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> “And he shall take up from it <b>his handful,</b> of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of its oil” (Leviticus 6:8). This verse teaches <b>that he should not measure an amount for the handful</b> of a meal-offering with a utensil, but he should separate it directly by hand. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether the High Priest may <b>measure an amount for the handful</b> of incense? Must the incense also be scooped by hand? |
| Leviticus 6:8 | the verse states: “His handful” | Yoma 47a:19 | § <b>The Sages taught: “His handfuls”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). I <b>might</b> have thought it should <b>be overflowing</b> from the handful, and therefore <b>the verse states: “His handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), which indicates a precise amount. <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is based solely on the phrase <b>“his handful,”</b> I <b>might</b> have thought the priest may pinch a small amount <b>even with</b> just <b>his fingertips,</b> not with his entire finger. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His handfuls”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), meaning <b>as people</b> usually <b>take a handful,</b> i.e., with their whole hand. <b>How</b> should he perform this service? <b>He scoops</b> by closing <b>his three fingers over the palm of his hand, and takes a handful</b> from the flour of the meal-offering. |
| Leviticus 6:8 | “And he shall take up from there his handful” | Zevachim 63a:12 | The Gemara presents a different answer: <b>Rather, it was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that the handful may be taken from the meal offering anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and then it states: <b>“And he shall take up from there his handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), indicating that the handful must be taken from the vessel in which the meal offering was brought near the altar, that the verses also indicate that the handful must be taken in the place where the vessel is brought near the altar. |
| Leviticus 6:9 | shall eat” | Menachot 21b:6 | The Gemara objects: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the salt is not to be eaten with <b>non-sacred</b> food? <b>What</b> would non-sacred food be <b>doing there</b> in the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: <b>Even though the Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the verse stated with regard to the meal offering: “And that which is left of it Aaron and his sons <b>shall eat”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), teaching <b>that</b> the priests <b>shall eat non-sacred</b> food <b>and <i>teruma</i> along with</b> the remainder of the meal offering <b>so that</b> the remainder of the meal offering <b>will be eaten in</b> a manner that the priest will be <b>satiated</b> when he finishes eating it, demonstrating that non-sacred food may be brought to the Temple courtyard, <b>even so we do not give them consecrated salt.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:9 | “In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it” | Menachot 9a:2 | The Gemara explains its objection: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>why do I</b> need this <b>verse? Let him say</b> here as well that as the verse states: <b>“In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), i.e., in the Temple courtyard, it is logical that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one, i.e., if one may consume a peace offering in the Temple courtyard then all the more so may he consume it in the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 6:9 | But isn’t it taught | Temurah 23a:7 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya raises an objection: And</b> is there such an opinion that the Sages <b>did not</b> care to <b>enact</b> a protective <b>ordinance with regard to consecrated</b> items, to prevent them from being left to die? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that deals with the remainder of a meal offering: “And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:9). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> at the end the apparently redundant expression: <b>“They shall eat”?</b> The verse <b>teaches that if</b> the remainder constitutes <b>a small</b> amount for <b>consumption,</b> the priests <b>eat non-sacred</b> food <b>and <i>teruma</i> with it, so that</b> the remainder <b>will be eaten while satiated.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:9 | “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place” | Yevamot 39b:24 | The <i>baraita</i> under discussion also presents another case that follows a similar model of initially being permitted, then prohibited, and then once again permitted. The Gemara analyzes the explanations of Rav Yitzḥak and Rava based on that clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Say the first clause</b> and try to explain it in a way consistent with the various explanations of the latter clause: The Torah states concerning the meal-offerings eaten by the priests: <b>“It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9); this indicates that doing so is <b>a mitzva,</b> |
| Leviticus 6:9 | the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place” | Yevamot 40a:1 | <b>as initially,</b> before the flour was consecrated, <b>it was among</b> all other foods that are <b>permitted to him,</b> and then when the flour was consecrated as a meal-offering, <b>it became forbidden</b> to him, <b>and</b> then once a handful of the offering was brought on the altar, <b>it reverted</b> from its forbidden status <b>and became permitted to him.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it would revert to its original permitted status;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), which indicates that it is <b>a mitzva</b> to eat it. |
| Leviticus 6:9 | the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place” | Yevamot 40a:4 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and if he wishes, another priest may eat it;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), to teach that it is <b>a mitzva</b> for the priest who prepares the offering to eat it himself. This explanation of the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is entirely consistent with Rava’s explanation of the latter clause concerning the mitzvot of levirate marriage. In his opinion, both clauses demonstrate that there is a mitzva to perform an action in a case where one might have thought there was none. |
| Leviticus 6:9 | in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it.” | Zevachim 56a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do they <b>not</b> have sanctity <b>by Torah law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>chambers</b> that are <b>built in the non-sacred</b> area of the Temple Mount <b>and open to the sacred</b> area, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that the priests enter there and eat there offerings of the most sacred order and the remainders of meal offerings? The verse states</b> with regard to a meal offering: “It shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; <b>in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it.”</b> (Leviticus 6:9). The verse could have simply stated: “In a holy place,” which indicates the courtyard. By also stating: “In the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting,” <b>the Torah amplified many courtyards with one</b> type of <b>eating,</b> i.e., of the meal offering. If the chambers do not have sanctity by Torah law, the Sages would not have permitted the priests to eat offerings of the most sacred order there. |
| Leviticus 6:9 | “In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it” | Zevachim 63a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is there a need to derive the <i>halakha</i> from this source? <b>Let us say</b> that it can be derived from the verse: <b>“In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), <b>and</b> the place of <b>secondary</b> sanctity <b>should not be weightier than the</b> place of <b>primary</b> sanctity. Therefore, similar to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, if the sacrificial food can be eaten in the courtyard, it can certainly be eaten in the Sanctuary. The fact that the <i>baraita</i> requires another source indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s method of derivation is not valid. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | as it is written: “It shall not be baked with leaven” | Bekhorot 33b:15 | <b>And furthermore,</b> one cannot draw parallels between the opinions of the two sources, as <b>here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of certain <b>verses, and there they disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of certain other <b>verses. As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> of the Sages who disagree as to whether one may let the blood of the firstborn animal <b>concede that one who leavens</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> another had already <b>leavened</b> it is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the additional leavening, <b>as it is written: “It shall not be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and</b> it is also stated: “No meal offering that you sacrifice to God <b>shall be made</b> with leaven” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” | Menachot 10b:5 | <b>If</b> one suggests that it is necessary <b>to</b> indicate that the <b>removal of the handful itself</b> must be performed with the right hand, this cannot be, since this is <b>derived from</b> the verse cited by <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya. As Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> does not require that the handful be sanctified in a service vessel? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” | Menachot 26a:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). Rabbi Shimon derives from here that the handful of the meal offering may be placed on the altar in the manner of the blood of either a sin offering or a guilt offering. If a priest <b>comes to perform the</b> sacrificial <b>rites of</b> a meal offering <b>with</b> his <b>hand, as</b> one performs the sprinkling of the blood of <b>a sin offering,</b> which is performed with the priest’s right index finger, <b>he must perform its rites with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like the sin offering.</b> If he performs the sacrificial rites <b>with a vessel,</b> as one performs the sprinkling of the blood of a guilt offering, whose blood is sprinkled from a vessel on the altar and whose sprinkling may be performed with the priest’s left hand, <b>he may perform its rites with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like the guilt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” | Menachot 2b:11 | § The Gemara cites the <i>baraita</i> that is the basis for the apparent contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Shimon, which was mentioned in the previous discussion: <b>And</b> a Sage <b>raises a contradiction</b> from one statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the verse written concerning the meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), indicates that <b>there are some</b> meal offerings whose <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a sin offering, and there are some</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a guilt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:10 | indispensable, it is also written: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread” | Menachot 53a:2 | Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: <b>With regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the requirement that meal offerings must come as <i>matza</i> is <b>indispensable, it is also written: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>but</b> rather must come as <b><i>matza</i>.</b> This additional verse indicates that even after the fact, if a meal offering was not made as <i>matza</i> it is not valid. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | their portion | Menachot 55a:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that one who allows the remainder of a meal offering to become leavened violates a prohibition. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: The verse states: “It shall not be baked with leaven.</b> I have given it as <b>their portion</b> of My offerings made by fire” (Leviticus 6:10). This section of the verse can be read as a single sentence, to indicate: <b>Even their portion</b> of meal offerings, i.e., the remainder eaten by priests after the removal of the handful to be burned on the altar, <b>shall not be baked with leaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:10 | be baked with leaven” | Menachot 55b:1 | <b>be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Isn’t</b> this requirement <b>already stated</b> earlier: <b>“No</b> meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord <b>shall be made with leaven;</b> as you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11)? Rather, the phrase “it shall not be baked with leaven” serves to teach a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>Since</b> the prohibition concerning leaven <b>is</b> first <b>stated</b> in general terms: <b>Shall not be made with leaven,</b> without specification, one <b>might</b> have thought that one who causes a meal offering to become leaven <b>will be liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes <b>for all of</b> his actions, i.e., kneading, shaping, and baking the dough. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall not be baked</b> with leaven,” which teaches that one who causes a meal offering to become leaven is liable separately for baking it, and for each stage of its preparation. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | their portion | Menachot 55b:4 | The Gemara answers: The verse: “It shall not be baked with leaven,” is required for the principle stated earlier. <b>We say</b> that the prohibition against allowing the remainder of a meal offering to become leavened is derived <b>from</b> the subsequent phrase: “I have given it as <b>their portion</b> of My offerings made by fire” (Leviticus 6:10). The remainder is the portion of the meal offering eaten by the priests. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It shall not be baked with leaven” | Menachot 56b:2 | The Gemara discusses similar cases, including examples involving meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> of the Sages who disagree as to whether one may let the blood of a firstborn animal whose blood circulation is constricted <b>concede that one who leavens</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> another had already <b>leavened</b> it is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the additional leavening, <b>as it is written:</b> “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord <b>shall be made with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 2:11), <b>and</b> it is also stated: <b>“It shall not be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). This indicates that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a meal offering. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | meal offering, which is called “a sin offering,” | Menachot 61a:14 | The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>This statement,</b> that the expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the west and not to the east, applies only with regard to the <b>meal offering, which is called “a sin offering,”</b> as the verse states: “It is most sacred, like the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and</b> the <b>sin offering requires</b> its remaining blood to be poured out on the <b>base</b> of the altar. Therefore, the meal offering must also be brought to a part of the altar where there is a base, <b>and</b> as the <b>southeast corner</b> of the altar <b>did not have a base,</b> the meal offering must be brought to the southwest corner. In this manner one fulfills both the requirement of “in front of the altar,” i.e., to the south, and the requirement of “before the Lord.” <b>But here,</b> with regard to the <i>log</i> of oil and guilt offering of a leper, <b>we call</b> any side of the altar <b>“before the Lord.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:10 | as it is stated: “It shall not be baked leavened” | Shabbat 111a:1 | <b>Everyone agrees that one who leavens</b> a meal-offering <b>after one who</b> already <b>leavened it is liable</b> for the additional leavening, <b>as it is stated: “It shall not be baked leavened”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), and it is also stated: “No offering that you sacrifice to God <b>shall be made with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). The Sages interpreted this to mean that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a Temple offering. Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates after one who castrates is liable, as it is stated: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b>, shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). Presumably, <b>if one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether <b>all the more so</b> one is liable. <b>Rather,</b> this comes to <b>include</b> that one who <b>detaches after one who cuts is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for sterilizing one who is already castrated. <b>Rather,</b> we must say that it is permitted to use a remedy that causes sterility <b>in an old man</b> who is no longer capable of procreating. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | isn’t it written: “It shall not be baked leavened, for their portion | Shevuot 15b:1 | <b>And if you would say that one leavens the remainder</b> of the meal-offering, which the priests partake of, <b>and he consecrates</b> the Temple courtyard <b>with it,</b> that too is difficult, as <b>isn’t it written: “It shall not be baked leavened, for their portion</b> I have given it to them” (Leviticus 6:10)? <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>Even</b> the priests’ <b>portion shall not be baked leavened,</b> as it is prohibited to bake even a portion of the meal-offering leavened. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It shall not be baked with leaven. Their portion | Sotah 15a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And they are prohibited only from allowing</b> the meal-offering <b>to become leavened.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to meal-offerings: <b>“It shall not be baked with leaven. Their portion</b> I have given it of My offerings made by fire” (Leviticus 6:10). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> One should read the verse as if the phrase “their portion” is part of the same phrase as the prohibition of baking with leaven. This teaches that <b>even their portion,</b> i.e., the portion given to the priests, <b>shall not be baked with leaven.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:10 | But isn’t it written: “Their portion shall not be baked leavened” | Yevamot 40a:8 | The Gemara interjects that the logic of this last statement seems implausible: Could it be that if he wishes, the offering could be leavened? <b>But isn’t it written: “Their portion shall not be baked leavened”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and Reish Lakish said</b> that both the handful brought on the altar <b>and even the</b> priest’s <b>portion shall not be baked leavened? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes he may eat it unleavened,</b> and if <b>he wishes he may eat it</b> even if it was prepared by being <b>boiled.</b> Therefore, the verse taught that one must eat it unleavened. Understood in this way, this clause of the <i>baraita</i> is also consistent with Rav Yitzḥak’s opinion. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” | Zevachim 11a:13 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), teaching that <b>a meal offering of a sinner is like a sin offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed its handful not for its sake,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> And the verse also teaches that <b>a voluntary meal offering is like a guilt offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed its handful not for its sake,</b> it is still <b>fit.</b> This accords with the opinion of the Rabbis, that a guilt offering slaughtered not for its sake is fit. |
| Leviticus 6:10 | “It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” | Zevachim 25a:2 | <b>If</b> one suggests that it is necessary <b>to</b> indicate that the <b>removal of</b> the <b>handful itself</b> must be performed with the right hand, this cannot be, since that is <b>derived from</b> the verse cited by <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya. As Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> does not require that the handful be sanctified in a service vessel? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). |
| Leviticus 6:10 | It is most sacred, | Zevachim 53b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> is <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> when the mishna earlier (52b) did not mention that a sin offering is of the most sacred order? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because</b> in the Torah <b>it is not written</b> explicitly <b>with regard to</b> the burnt offering: <b>It is most sacred,</b> as it states concerning the sin offering and the guilt offering in a verse concerning a meal offering: “It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” (Leviticus 6:10). Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> explicitly states that a burnt offering is likewise of the most sacred order. |
| Leviticus 6:11 | “statute” is written with regard to it, | Menachot 19a:18 | The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> what of the <b>meal offering, as</b> the term <b>“statute” is written with regard to it,</b> as the verse states: “Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a statute forever” (Leviticus 6:11), <b>and</b> yet <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> sacrificial rite of <b>the law of the meal offering that the verse repeats,</b> as the details of the meal offering are discussed in Leviticus, chapter 2, and again in Leviticus, chapter 6, it is repeated <b>only to</b> teach that the failure to perform that rite <b>invalidates</b> the offering? Doesn’t this demonstrate that where the verse <b>repeated</b> the command, then <b>yes,</b> failure to perform the rite invalidates the offering; but if the verse <b>did not repeat</b> it, then failure to perform the rite does <b>not</b> invalidate the offering, whether or not the term statute appears? |
| Leviticus 6:11 | absorbed, | Menachot 83a:8 | § <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> in the name of Rabbi Akiva</b> that the verse states: <b>“This is the law</b> of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). From the term <b>“meal offering”</b> it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> whatever it touches <b>is sanctified through</b> the substance that becomes <b>absorbed,</b> as it is stated: “Whatever shall touch them shall be sacred” (Leviticus 6:11), <b>so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned in this verse, whatever they touch <b>is sanctified through</b> the <b>absorbed</b> portions. |
| Leviticus 6:11 | “Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it” | Sotah 23b:5 | The mishna states: <b>A priest may eat from offerings of the most sacred order,</b> but a daughter of a priest may not eat from offerings of the most sacred order. The Gemara explains: This is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the meal-offering, which is an offering of the most sacred order: <b>“Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 6:11). |
| Leviticus 6:11 | “Every male | Zevachim 102a:19 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Blemished</b> priests, <b>whether</b> they are temporarily <b>blemished</b> or permanently blemished, receive a share and partake of offerings, but do not sacrifice them. The Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the meal offering: <b>“Every male</b> among the sons of Aaron shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:11). The phrase “every male” serves <b>to include blemished</b> priests. |
| Leviticus 6:11 | absorbed, | Zevachim 98a:6 | § With regard to the verse at the center of the prior exchange (Leviticus 7:37), the Gemara states: <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> in the name of Rabbi Akiva:</b> From the term <b>“meal offering,”</b> it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> whatever it touches <b>is sanctified through</b> the substance that becomes <b>absorbed,</b> as it is stated: “Whatever shall touch them shall be sacred” (Leviticus 6:11); <b>so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned in this verse, whatever they touch <b>is sanctified through</b> the <b>absorbed</b> portions. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | the verse states: “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons | Horayot 9a:4 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: An anointed</b> priest <b>is exempt from</b> bringing an offering in <b>all</b> the cases where one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva?</b> It is as <b>the verse states: “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons</b> that they shall offer unto the Lord on the day that he is anointed: One-tenth part of an ephah of fine flour as a meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:13). One can infer: It is <b>this</b> tenth of an ephah that <b>comes</b> as <b>an obligation for him, and no other</b> such offering <b>comes</b> as <b>an obligation for him.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:13 | verse states: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually” | Menachot 50b:22 | <b>Abaye said</b> that there is a different explanation: The <b>verse states: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually”</b> (Leviticus 6:13); |
| Leviticus 6:13 | the Sages taught | Menachot 50b:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, commenting on the verse: “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord on the day when he is anointed: The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). <b>If</b> the verse had <b>stated: A meal offering</b> perpetually, <b>half</b> in the morning and half in the evening; <b>I would have said</b> that the High Priest <b>brings half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the morning and sacrifices</b> it, and then he brings <b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the afternoon and sacrifices</b> it. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | the verse states: “Half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” | Menachot 50b:7 | Since <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), it teaches that <b>he sacrifices half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah. <b>How so?</b> The High Priest <b>brings</b> from his house <b>a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour, <b>and divides it</b> in half, <b>and sacrifices half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:13 | fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [ tamid ], | Menachot 51a:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues its determination of how much oil is brought with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> “This is the offering of Aaron…the tenth part of an ephah of <b>fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>],</b> half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). The fact that the verse makes reference to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest as <i>tamid</i> teaches that <b>it is in</b> the same category as <b>the meal offering</b> component <b>of the daily offerings [<i>temidin</i>]. Just as the meal offering</b> component <b>of the daily offerings</b> requires <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>so too this</b> griddle-cake offering of the High Priest requires <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | verse: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [ tamid ]” | Menachot 51a:19 | Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>then said: Let it even be</b> that the purpose of the verse is <b>to establish only</b> that <b>it</b> requires <b>oil,</b> and even so one can <b>arrive</b> at the conclusion that three <i>log</i> are required due to the <b>derivation</b> based upon the verbal analogy from the meal offering brought with the libations that accompany animal offerings. <b>But</b> although Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, attempts to <b>employ</b> this <b>derivation he is unsuccessful,</b> as there is a counter-indication from another verbal analogy to the voluntary meal offering. Therefore, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>needed</b> to derive the <i>halakha</i> from the <b>verse: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), <b>as Rabbi Yishmael,</b> son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>concluded his statement</b> in the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | “And half of it” | Menachot 51b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the expression: <b>“And half of it”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), as discussed on 50b; the word “and,” which is added by the letter <i>vav</i> at the beginning of the word, is expounded to mean that the replacement High Priest must bring a complete tenth of an ephah of fine flour. The Gemara answers: He did not derive the <i>halakha</i> from there because <b>he does not expound</b> the extra letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in that word, as he holds that its addition is not significant. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day when he is anointed” | Menachot 51b:7 | <b>That</b> verse <b>is needed for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day when he is anointed”</b> (Leviticus 6:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse speaks of the offering in the singular, it means that <b>Aaron and his sons should sacrifice one offering.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “Which they shall offer to the Lord,”</b> in plural, teaching that <b>Aaron</b> sacrifices an offering <b>by himself</b> as the High Priest, <b>and his sons</b> sacrifice offerings <b>by themselves</b> as ordinary priests. When the verse refers to <b>“his sons,” these are the ordinary priests.</b> Each priest must bring a griddle-cake offering as an offering of initiation when he begins his service. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [ tamid ], | Menachot 52a:17 | <b>And Rava then said</b> to them: <b>This</b> statement, that the griddle-cake offering is sacrificed twice a day even if there is no High Priest, is <b>also</b> one of <b>our superior</b> statements, as <b>the verse states</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>],</b> half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). This teaches that the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>is like the meal offering</b> component of the <b>daily offerings [<i>temidin</i>]</b> and must be sacrificed in the morning and the afternoon, even if the High Priest died and was not yet replaced. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | half of it | Menachot 8a:8 | § The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> With regard to the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>High Priest, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified in halves, and Rabbi Elazar says: Since it is sacrificed in halves,</b> as half of the meal offering is sacrificed in the morning and half in the afternoon, it may likewise be <b>sanctified in halves. Rav Aḥa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan? The verse states: “A meal offering</b> perpetually, <b>half of it</b> in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). This means: First <b>bring</b> a whole <b>meal offering, and</b> only <b>afterward divide it</b> into halves. |
| Leviticus 6:13 | a tenth of an ephah” | Yoma 5b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, trousers</b> can be derived, as the verse <b>is written</b> in the context <b>of the matter of</b> priestly <b>garments</b> detailed adjacent to the portion of the inauguration. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>the tenth of an ephah, from where do we</b> derive that there is an obligation to offer it during the inauguration? The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>this</b> that appears in one verse and the word <b>this</b> that appears in another. It is written: <b>“This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord</b> in the day when he is anointed, <b>a tenth of an ephah”</b> (Leviticus 6:13). And in the verse cited above in the context of the inauguration it says: “And this is the matter that you shall do for them,” which teaches that there is an obligation to offer a tenth of an ephah during the inauguration. |
| Leviticus 6:14 | the High Priest prepared? | Menachot 50b:16 | § The Gemara cites that which <b>was stated</b> further about the griddle-cake offering: <b>How are the griddle-cake</b> offerings of <b>the High Priest prepared?</b> The verse seems to prescribe a variety of methods of preparation: “On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, you shall bring it in; and baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering shall you sacrifice for a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:14). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>bakes it</b> in an oven <b>and afterward he fries it</b> in a pan. <b>Rabbi Asi</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>fries it</b> in a pan <b>and afterward he bakes</b> it in an oven. |
| Leviticus 6:14 | shall be made | Menachot 50b:21 | The Gemara cites another explanation of why the preparation of these loaves overrides Shabbat. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “On a griddle it <b>shall be made</b> with oil” (Leviticus 6:14), which teaches that it shall be made under all circumstances, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> Similarly, this phrase <b>“shall be made”</b> teaches that it should be made <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:14 | “On a griddle [ maḥavat ]” | Menachot 51a:17 | <b>And</b> with regard to the possibility of deriving that only one <i>log</i> is required, as in the voluntary meal offering, <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying:</b> The term <b>“with the oil”</b> stated with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest comes <b>to add</b> more <b>oil to it</b> than the single <i>log</i> required for the voluntary meal offering. <b>As, if</b> the purpose of that term were merely <b>to establish</b> the basic fact that the offering must include <b>oil,</b> a verse is <b>not needed</b> to teach that. <b>Since it is written with</b> respect to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“On a griddle [<i>maḥavat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), it is <b>comparable to a pan [<i>maḥavat</i>] meal offering,</b> which requires oil. |
| Leviticus 6:14 | “On a griddle” | Menachot 51a:2 | <b>Rava said</b> that the basis for it overriding Shabbat is the fact that the verse states: <b>“On a griddle”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), which <b>teaches that</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>requires a vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>if he had baked it the previous day</b> rather than on Shabbat, it would be <b>disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight,</b> since the loaves had already been consecrated in a service vessel. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: “On a griddle” teaches that</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>requires a vessel.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:14 | “On a griddle [ maḥavat ]” | Menachot 51a:21 | <b>And this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying:</b> The term <b>“with the oil”</b> serves <b>to add</b> extra <b>oil to it. As, if</b> the purpose of that term were merely <b>to establish</b> that the offering must include <b>oil,</b> a verse is <b>not needed</b> to teach that. <b>Since it is written with</b> respect to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“On a griddle [<i>maḥavat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), it is <b>comparable to a pan [<i>maḥavat</i>]</b> meal offering, which requires oil. <b>And</b> even <b>if</b> the verse <b>had not stated: “With the oil,” I have</b> a manner of <b>derivation</b> for the fact that more than one <i>log</i> of oil is required, based upon a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 6:14 | poached [ revikha ], | Menachot 53a:6 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> also <b>objects to</b> Rabbi Ami’s explanation: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>“It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” but</b> one may bring a meal offering that has been <b>boiled,</b> as this is not leavened bread; although it is also not <i>matza</i>. The Gemara asks: This <b>boiled</b> dough, <b>what is it?</b> It is <b>poached [<i>revikha</i>],</b> as described in the verse: “In a pan it shall be made of oil, when it is soaked [<i>murbekhet</i>]” (Leviticus 6:14). If so, there is no need to derive the <i>halakha</i> of boiled dough from the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread.” <b>If</b> it is a meal offering that must be <b>poached, it is</b> explicitly <b>written with regard to it</b> that it must be <b>poached. And</b> if it is a meal offering that is not to be poached, <b>it is not written with regard to it</b> that it is <b>poached.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:14 | folds it | Menachot 75b:4 | <b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>the meal offering of an Israelite,</b> the priest <b>folds one into two and two into four and separates</b> the pieces. In breaking into pieces <b>the meal offering of priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> the priest <b>folds it</b> into two, as it is stated: “In broken pieces you shall sacrifice the offering” (Leviticus 6:14). The Gemara asks: With regard to the meal offering of the anointed priest, <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>He would not fold it? Rabba says:</b> He <b>does not fold it into four,</b> as it does not use the doubled phrase: “You shall break it in pieces [<i>patot otah pitim</i>],” <b>but</b> he does <b>fold it into two.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:15 | as it is written: “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons” | Horayot 11b:11 | § The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: And even a High Priest, son of a High Priest, requires anointing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons”</b> (Leviticus 6:15). <b>Let the verse say</b> only: <b>The priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons. What</b> is the reason that it says: <b>“The anointed</b> priest”? The Torah <b>teaches us that</b> even <b>from among the sons of a High Priest, if he is anointed</b> with oil <b>he is a High Priest, and if not, he is not a High Priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:15 | The Sages taught: “Anointed” | Horayot 12a:15 | § The mishna teaches: And who is the anointed priest? It is the High Priest <b>who is anointed with the anointing oil,</b> not the High Priest consecrated by donning multiple garments. <b>The Sages taught: “Anointed”</b> is written in the verse (Leviticus 6:15). One <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is to <b>a king.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Priest.” If</b> the reference is to <b>a priest,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is to a priest consecrated by donning <b>multiple garments.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anointed.” If</b> the reference is to one who is <b>anointed,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is even to a priest <b>anointed for war.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the anointed priest,”</b> indicating <b>that there is no anointed</b> priest <b>over him;</b> rather, he is the highest-ranking priest. |
| Leviticus 6:15 | as it is written: “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons” | Keritot 5b:5 | The Gemara clarifies several aspects of this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> earlier: <b>And even a High Priest, the son of a High Priest, requires anointing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons”</b> (Leviticus 6:15). <b>Let the verse say</b> merely: <b>The priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons. What</b> is taught by the addition of the term <b>“anointed”? This teaches us that even</b> when the new High Priest is <b>from among</b> the <b>sons</b> of the previous High Priest, only <b>that</b> priest <b>who is anointed</b> with oil <b>is</b> the <b>High Priest, but if</b> he is <b>not anointed</b> with oil he <b>is not</b> the <b>High Priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:15 | “It shall be wholly made to smoke” | Menachot 51b:13 | The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the griddle-cake <b>meal offering of the High Priest</b> mentioned <b>above is</b> included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and</b> that the voluntary <b>meal offering</b> of the <b>ordinary priest</b> mentioned <b>below is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). |
| Leviticus 6:15 | “Wholly” | Menachot 51b:14 | <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is mandated <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“Wholly,”</b> and the verse uses the word <b>“wholly”</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of a priest, in order <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering of the High Priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). |
| Leviticus 6:15 | “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it” | Menachot 51b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the <b>High Priest died and they did not appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, from where</b> is it derived <b>that his</b> griddle-cake <b>meal offering should be sacrificed from</b> the property <b>of the heirs</b> of the High Priest? <b>The verse states</b> in reference to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it”</b> (Leviticus 6:15). |
| Leviticus 6:15 | “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons | Menachot 51b:8 | <b>Do you say</b> that this is referring to the offering of initiation of <b>ordinary priests, or is it</b> referring <b>only</b> to the griddle-cake offering of the <b>High Priests? When</b> the verse <b>states</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons</b> shall offer it; it is a statute forever to the Lord; it shall be wholly made to smoke to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:15), the griddle-cake offering of the <b>High Priest is thereby mentioned. How do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“his sons”</b> in Leviticus 6:13? <b>These are the ordinary priests,</b> and the verse is referring to their offering of initiation. Consequently, verse 15 is referring to the basic obligation of the High Priest to bring the griddle-cake offering, rather than referring to a case of a High Priest who died. |
| Leviticus 6:15 | They require it for that which is taught | Menachot 74a:19 | The Gemara answers: <b>They require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the griddle-cake offering, the verse states: “It shall be entirely smoked for the Lord” (Leviticus 6:15). From this verse and the verse that follows it, which states: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the griddle-cake offering mentioned <b>above,</b> in the first verse, is subject <b>to: “It shall be entirely smoked,” and</b> that other meal offerings of priests mentioned <b>below,</b> in the second verse, are subject <b>to: “It shall not be eaten.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:15 | obligation | Menachot 76a:5 | That the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest</b> is also offered as twelve units is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the word “obligation,” written in the context of the verse discussing the <b>shewbread.</b> With regard to the griddle-cake offering, the verse states: “And the anointed priest…shall offer it; it is an <b>obligation</b> forever” (Leviticus 6:15), and the verse states with regard to the twelve loaves of the shewbread: “And it shall be for Aaron and his sons…a perpetual <b>obligation”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). |
| Leviticus 6:15 | “statute” is written with regard to | Menachot 8a:10 | The Gemara responds: Rabbi Elazar maintains that the verse requires that a whole meal offering be brought in the morning only <b>for a mitzva,</b> i.e., <i>ab initio</i>. Nevertheless, if half of a tenth was brought in the morning it is valid after the fact. <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil said to Rav Ashi: But</b> the term <b>“statute” is written with regard to</b> the griddle-cake offering, as the verse states: “A statute forever” (Leviticus 6:15), and there is a principle that whenever the Torah calls a mitzva a statute, the details of its performance are indispensable. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: It was necessary</b> for the Torah to define this mitzva as a statute <b>only with regard to</b> the requirement that the High Priest <b>bring a full</b> tenth <b>from his home.</b> With regard to its sanctification in a service vessel, it can be sanctified in halves. |
| Leviticus 6:15 | griddle-cake | Yoma 34a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of the one who said:</b> The <b>vessels</b> of frankincense <b>precede the additional offerings?</b> The Gemara explains: By means of a verbal analogy <b>he derives: Statute,</b> written with regard to the vessels of frankincense: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 24:9), <b>from: Statute,</b> written with regard to the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 6:15). Just as the griddle-cake offering precedes the additional offerings, so too, the vessels of frankincense precede the additional offerings. |
| Leviticus 6:16 | “And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten” | Arakhin 4a:8 | Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his</b> half-<b>shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the priests</b> who do not contribute the half-shekel, in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva they <b>interpret this verse to their own</b> advantage: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). |
| Leviticus 6:16 | a meal offering of a priest is not consumed, | Chullin 131b:21 | § With regard to the gifts of the priesthood, the Gemara relates that <b>Ulla would give gifts</b> of the priesthood <b>to a female priest,</b> i.e., the daughter of a priest, even if she was married to an Israelite. <b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the practice of <b>Ulla</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The remainder of <b>a meal offering of a female priest is consumed,</b> just like the remainder of the meal offering of an Israelite. But the remainder of <b>a meal offering of a priest is not consumed,</b> as the verse states: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16). |
| Leviticus 6:16 | “It shall be burned in its entirety” | Makkot 18b:2 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him also be flogged in accordance with the other</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“It shall be burned in its entirety”</b> (Leviticus 6:16), the verse serves <b>to impose a prohibition upon its consumption,</b> as it is written: “It shall be burned in its entirety; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16). The Gemara explains: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that according to Rabbi Shimon one is flogged for violating this prohibition as well, <b>and Rava is saying</b> that <b>from this verse</b> he is interpreting that it is derived that one is flogged with five sets of lashes according to Rabbi Shimon. |
| Leviticus 6:16 | “And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten” | Menachot 21b:15 | The verse states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat, brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal offerings, are <b>ours,</b> then if we contribute shekels we will have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the shekels. <b>How,</b> then, <b>can they be eaten?</b> They would then be regarded as priests’ meal offerings, which must be wholly burned. |
| Leviticus 6:16 | “And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten” | Menachot 46b:18 | The verse states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat, brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal offerings, <b>are ours,</b> then if we contribute half-shekels we will have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the half-shekels. <b>How,</b> then, <b>can they be eaten?</b> They would then be regarded as priests’ meal offerings, which must be wholly burned. |
| Leviticus 6:16 | “It shall not be eaten” | Menachot 51b:13 | The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the griddle-cake <b>meal offering of the High Priest</b> mentioned <b>above is</b> included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and</b> that the voluntary <b>meal offering</b> of the <b>ordinary priest</b> mentioned <b>below is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). |
| Leviticus 6:16 | “Wholly” | Menachot 51b:14 | <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is mandated <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“Wholly,”</b> and the verse uses the word <b>“wholly”</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of a priest, in order <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering of the High Priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). |
| Leviticus 6:16 | Rabbi Shimon says: | Menachot 72b:20 | <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Although its remainder is not eaten by priests, as meal offerings of priests are burned in their entirety, as it is written: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16), nevertheless, with regard to the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests, a handful is removed.

| Leviticus 6:16 | “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten” | Menachot 73b:19 | The <i>baraita</i> discusses the matter: <b>Do you say that</b> this verse teaches that <b>the rite</b> of the meal offering of a sinner <b>would be valid</b> when performed <b>by him? Or is it only</b> necessary <b>to permit</b> the eating of the remainder of the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests. And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse that states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16)? Perhaps that is referring to <b>his voluntary meal offering, but his obligatory</b> meal offering <b>may be eaten.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:16 | the father of Rabbi Avin teaches: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten” | Menachot 74a:13 | The Gemara answers that there are consecrated items that are intentionally wasted. With regard to such items, <b>the father of Rabbi Avin teaches: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Why must this verse, which follows those discussing the High Priest’s daily griddle-cake offering, state that it shall not be eaten, after it already states that it is entirely offered? The verse teaches: <b>I have likened</b> the meal offering of a sinner brought by a priest to the daily griddle-cake offering brought by the High Priest <b>with regard to eating,</b> insofar as it is not eaten, <b>but</b> I have <b>not</b> likened it <b>with regard to another matter,</b> i.e., that the meal offering of a sinner is not burned in the manner of the griddle-cake offering. |
| Leviticus 6:16 | burned, | Sotah 23a:2 | <b>And all the</b> women <b>who are married to priests, their meal-offerings are</b> always <b>burned,</b> as the verse states: “And every meal-offering of a priest shall be completely burned; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16). <b>An Israelite woman who is married to a priest, her meal-offering is burned; and</b> the <b>daughter of a priest who is married to an Israelite, her meal-offering is eaten.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:16 | as the verse states: “And every meal-offering of a priest shall be completely burned; it shall not be eaten” | Sotah 23b:2 | § The mishna states: In the case of <b>an Israelite woman who is married</b> to a priest, her meal-offering is burned; and in the case of the daughter of a priest who is married to an Israelite, her meal-offering is eaten. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? This is <b>as the verse states: “And every meal-offering of a priest shall be completely burned; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). One can infer that this applies to <b>a priest, but not</b> to <b>the daughter of a priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:18 | which is written: “This is the law of the sin offering” | Menachot 110a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), <b>and: “This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1)? These verses teach that <b>anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of the sin offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a sin offering, and anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of a guilt offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a guilt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:18 | for the sake of a sin offering of a leper should be valid and effect acceptance. As the Merciful One states: “And this is the law of the sin offering” | Menachot 3b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the phrase “And this is the law of the meal offering” teaches that a meal offering is not disqualified despite the improper intent for a different meal offering, then analogously, <b>a sin offering</b> brought to atone for eating forbidden <b>fat that one slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering</b> to atone for drinking <b>blood,</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering</b> to atone for <b>idol worship,</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering of a nazirite,</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering of a leper should be valid and effect acceptance. As the Merciful One states: “And this is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), from which it should be derived that there is <b>one law for all sin offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:18 | “And this is the law of the sin offering” | Menachot 4a:4 | Likewise, Rav Asi <b>did not resolve</b> the dilemma <b>in accordance with</b> the resolution stated by <b>Rava,</b> that the verse “And this is the law of the meal offering” teaches that a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of another meal offering is valid, whereas a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering is disqualified. This is <b>because of the difficulty</b> arising from the verse: <b>“And this is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), i.e., despite this verse, the <i>halakha</i> is that a sin offering that was slaughtered for the sake of another sin offering is not valid. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered | Menachot 55b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And do you learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here? But isn’t it already stated:</b> “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin offering: <b>In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered</b> before God; it is most holy” (Leviticus 6:18)? If so, <b>to what</b> purpose <b>was this singled out?</b> Why does the Torah state explicitly that the sin offering of the king requires slaughter in the north? The <i>baraita</i> answers: It is <b>to fix</b> a place <b>for it,</b> that this is the only place where a sin offering may be slaughtered, teaching <b>that if he did not slaughter it in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>he has disqualified it</b> even after the fact. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | sin offering is derived through interpretation, it is dear to | Zevachim 48a:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the location for slaughtering the <b>sin offering is derived through interpretation, it is dear to</b> the <i>tanna</i>, and he therefore he gives it precedence. The verse states: “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered before the Lord; it is most holy” (Leviticus 6:18). The Gemara (55a) derives from this verse that the sin offering must be slaughtered in the same place as the burnt offering, i.e., in the north of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered | Zevachim 48b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And do you learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here? But isn’t it already stated:</b> “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin offering: <b>In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered</b> before the Lord; it is most holy” (Leviticus 6:18)? If so, <b>to what</b> purpose <b>was this singled out?</b> Why did the Torah state explicitly that the sin offering of the king requires slaughter in the north? The Gemara answers: <b>To fix a place for it,</b> that this is the only place where a sin offering may be slaughtered, teaching <b>that if it was not slaughtered in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, the offering is <b>disqualified</b> even after the fact. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | a burnt offering, | Zevachim 55a:2 | <b>Rava said to him: But from where</b> is the requirement to slaughter <b>a sin offering</b> in the north of the Temple courtyard <b>derived?</b> It is derived <b>from</b> its juxtaposition with <b>a burnt offering,</b> as the verse states: “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered before the Lord; it is most holy” (Leviticus 6:18). In the realm of consecrated matters, can <b>a matter derived via a juxtaposition then teach</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>via a juxtaposition?</b> The Gemara (49b) demonstrates that it cannot. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | the law of the sin offering” | Zevachim 92a:6 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>the blood of a sin offering</b> designated for presentation <b>that was sprayed on a garment, that</b> garment <b>requires laundering,</b> as is stated with regard to a sin offering: “And when any of its blood shall be sprinkled on a garment, you shall launder that on which it shall be sprinkled in a sacred place” (Leviticus 6:20). <b>Although the verse is speaking only of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten</b> and whose blood is presented on the outer altar, <b>as it is stated: “In a sacred place shall it be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:19), the principle is not exclusive to eaten sin offerings. With regard to the blood of <b>both</b> the sin offerings <b>that are eaten and the</b> sin offerings that are wholly burned and not eaten and whose blood is presented on the <b>inner</b> altar, garments sprayed with blood from each of these offerings <b>require laundering. As it is stated</b> at the start of that passage: “This is <b>the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), it is understood: There is <b>one law for all the sin offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:18 | be slaughtered” | Zevachim 92a:9 | <b>Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Kappara: The verse states:</b> “This is the law of the sin offering…<b>shall</b> the sin offering <b>be slaughtered”</b> (Leviticus 6:18). <b>The verse is speaking</b> specifically <b>of</b> sin offerings <b>that are slaughtered</b> and not of bird offerings, which are killed by pinching the nape of the neck, rather than slaughtering with a knife. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | the verse states: “This | Zevachim 92b:17 | <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, deduced from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the blood of a bird sin offering would require laundering</b> if sprayed on a garment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> is the law of the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:18), which excludes the bird sin offering. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> a vessel <b>unfit for</b> sprinkling the blood of a bird, this interpretation is unnecessary. <b>I will deduce</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a bird’s blood does not require laundering <b>because</b> the blood <b>becomes disqualified</b> even by merely passing <b>into the airspace of a vessel.</b> Consequently, the blood is disqualified when coming into the airspace of the garment, which is considered a vessel, and, as disqualified blood, it does not subsequently require laundering. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | is written, | Zevachim 92b:6 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: Can one say that the passage about laundering applies specifically to internal sin offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Although the verse is speaking only of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten,</b> indicating that the passage certainly applies to sin offerings that are eaten? The Gemara answers: The mishna’s statement pertains <b>to the matter of scouring and rinsing</b> copper vessels in which a sin offering was cooked (see Leviticus 6:21), which is relevant only to sin offerings that are eaten. <b>But in the matter of laundering:</b> “You shall launder that on which <b>it shall be sprinkled”</b> (Leviticus 6:20) <b>is written,</b> and the term “it shall be sprinkled” indicates only internal sin offerings. By contrast, eaten sin offerings are included only through the amplification in the verse: “The law of the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:18). |
| Leviticus 6:18 | sin offering” | Zevachim 96b:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Whether</b> the meat is from <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> or whether it is from offerings of lesser sanctity, the vessels in which it is cooked must be scoured and rinsed. The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sages taught:</b> The Torah introduces the mitzva of scouring and rinsing with the qualifying statement: “This is the law of the <b>sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to scouring and rinsing applies to vessels in which <b>a sin offering</b> was cooked. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this <i>halakha</i> applies to vessels used for <b>all sacrificial</b> meat? <b>The verse states:</b> “Every male among the priests may eat of it; <b>it is most sacred”</b> (Leviticus 6:22), to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies to vessels used for all of the sacrificial meat that the priests eat. |
| Leviticus 6:18 | as the verse states: “This is the law of the sin offering” | Zevachim 9b:4 | § <b>Rav says in the name of Mavog: A sin offering that</b> one <b>slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering of Nahshon,</b> i.e., a sin offering similar to those brought by the princes during the dedication of the Tabernacle (see Numbers, chapter 7), not to atone for a sin but as a gift, is <b>fit</b> and satisfies its owner’s obligation; <b>as the verse states: “This is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), indicating that there is <b>one law for all the sin offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:19 | “The priest who effects atonement shall eat it” | Zevachim 102b:16 | The pure priest responded: The verse <b>states</b> with regard to the sin offering: <b>“The priest who effects atonement shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:19). If you wish to receive a share of a sin offering, <b>come effect atonement and partake</b> of one. Since you cannot perform the service of a sin offering, having immersed only today, you cannot receive a share in its meat either. |
| Leviticus 6:19 | “The priest who offers it” | Zevachim 10b:25 | <b>Rather, this is Rabbi Eliezer’s reason</b> for not claiming that the blood of a guilt offering is presented below the red line: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the presenting of the blood of a sin offering: <b>“The priest who offers it”</b> (Leviticus 6:19). The word “it” indicates that <b>its blood</b> is presented <b>above</b> the red line, <b>but the blood of another</b> slaughtered offering is <b>not</b> presented <b>above</b> the red line. |
| Leviticus 6:19 | “The priest that sacrifices it for sin | Zevachim 52b:2 | The Gemara continues its discussion of the remainder of the blood. <b>Rami bar Ḥama says: This</b> following <b><i>tanna</i> holds</b> that failure to pour the <b>remainder</b> of the blood of offerings whose blood is sprinkled inside the Sanctuary <b>disqualifies</b> the offering, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The priest that sacrifices it for sin</b> shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:19). The verse states the word “it” to teach that <b>it,</b> the offering <b>whose blood was sprinkled</b> correctly, <b>above</b> the red line of the altar, is valid, and the priest may eat the meat. <b>But</b> this is <b>not</b> so for an offering <b>whose blood was sprinkled below</b> the red line, which is disqualified. |
| Leviticus 6:19 | it | Zevachim 52b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to an animal sin offering that is sacrificed outside: “The priest that sacrifices <b>it</b> for sin shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:19), to emphasize that <b>it,</b> the offering <b>whose blood was placed</b> correctly, <b>above</b> the red line of the altar, is valid, and the priest may eat the meat. <b>But</b> this is <b>not</b> so for an offering <b>whose blood was placed below</b> the red line, which is disqualified. |
| Leviticus 6:19 | that are eaten, as it is written: “In a sacred place shall it be eaten” | Zevachim 92a:10 | The Gemara challenges: <b>And I</b> might <b>say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is to be learned in another manner, and <b>the verse is speaking</b> specifically <b>of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten, as it is written: “In a sacred place shall it be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:19); <b>but internal</b> sin offerings, which are not eaten, should <b>not</b> be included. The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> by stating: “This is <b>the law of</b> the sin offering,” which includes all sin offerings, even those that are not eaten. |
| Leviticus 6:19 | as it is stated: “In a sacred place shall it be eaten” | Zevachim 92a:6 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>the blood of a sin offering</b> designated for presentation <b>that was sprayed on a garment, that</b> garment <b>requires laundering,</b> as is stated with regard to a sin offering: “And when any of its blood shall be sprinkled on a garment, you shall launder that on which it shall be sprinkled in a sacred place” (Leviticus 6:20). <b>Although the verse is speaking only of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten</b> and whose blood is presented on the outer altar, <b>as it is stated: “In a sacred place shall it be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:19), the principle is not exclusive to eaten sin offerings. With regard to the blood of <b>both</b> the sin offerings <b>that are eaten and the</b> sin offerings that are wholly burned and not eaten and whose blood is presented on the <b>inner</b> altar, garments sprayed with blood from each of these offerings <b>require laundering.

| Leviticus 6:19 | shall eat it” | Zevachim 92b:3 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> There is another way to prove that the blood of a bird sin offering is not required to be laundered out if it is sprayed on a garment. With regard to laundering, <b>the verse states:</b> “The priest that offers it for sin <b>shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:19); the obligation described applies <b>to it,</b> i.e., the eaten animal sin offering, <b>and not to another</b> similar sin offering. Consequently, <b>the verse is excluding</b> a case <b>within</b> the broad category of <b>eaten</b> sin offerings, and one is not required to launder out the blood of a bird sin offering. |
| Leviticus 6:19 | “The priest who effects atonement shall eat it; | Zevachim 99a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a priest who is unfit for the Temple service does not receive a share of the sacrificial meat. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> about a sin offering: <b>“The priest who effects atonement shall eat it;</b> in a sacred place shall it be eaten, in the court of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 6:19). This teaches that only <b>a priest who effects atonement</b> by performing the rites of the offering <b>shall partake</b> of its meat, but a priest <b>who does not effect atonement does not partake</b> of its meat. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | with regard to the sin offering: “Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy” | Chullin 99a:1 | The Gemara objects: <b>Let</b> us <b>learn from</b> the case of the nazirite’s ram that the flavor of sacrificial food can be nullified. The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to the sin offering: “Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). This teaches that the halakhic status of any food that touches and absorbs flavor from a sin offering <b>becomes like it, so</b> that <b>if</b> the sin offering <b>is disqualified,</b> this food <b>shall</b> also <b>be disqualified, and if</b> the sin offering is <b>valid,</b> this food may be <b>eaten in accordance with the stringencies</b> that apply to a sin offering. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | if any of its blood is sprinkled | Meilah 5a:15 | The Gemara explains why the above conclusion is untenable: <b>Read here</b> the verse that states, with regard to laundering a garment on which the blood of a sin offering was sprayed: “And <b>if any of its blood is sprinkled</b> on a garment, you shall wash that upon which it was sprinkled in a holy place” (Leviticus 6:20). The Sages infer from the verse that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to the blood of a sin offering that has not yet been sprinkled, <b>and not to</b> blood of a sin offering whose blood <b>had already been sprinkled. Rather,</b> one can conclude that the language of the mishna with regard to the topic of the blood of a sin offering is <b>not exact,</b> as the same <i>halakha</i> applies even if the blood was collected and sprinkled by those who are fit. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | “Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated” | Nazir 37b:8 | It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing a sin-offering <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). One <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is consecrated <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its flesh,”</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | “Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated” | Pesachim 45a:2 | The Gemara elaborates: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance in the case of <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>that which we stated</b> above. With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is</b> the derivation that permitted material combines with prohibited material? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). I <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is rendered prohibited <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: In its flesh shall become consecrated,</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | when there will be sprinkled [ yizze ] | Zevachim 38b:13 | The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> one can claim in the same manner that it is only blood that sprayed <b>from the base</b> of the altar that <b>does not require laundering; but</b> blood <b>that is fit for the base</b> of the altar, i.e., what remains of the blood after it has been placed on the corners, <b>requires laundering.</b> This is difficult, as <b>it is written:</b> “And <b>when there will be sprinkled [<i>yizze</i>]</b> of its blood upon any garment” (Leviticus 6:20). The future form of the word <i>yizze</i> serves to <b>exclude</b> this blood sprayed onto the garment from the corner of the altar, <b>as it has already been sprinkled.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | requires laundering, | Zevachim 92a:6 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>the blood of a sin offering</b> designated for presentation <b>that was sprayed on a garment, that</b> garment <b>requires laundering,</b> as is stated with regard to a sin offering: “And when any of its blood shall be sprinkled on a garment, you shall launder that on which it shall be sprinkled in a sacred place” (Leviticus 6:20). <b>Although the verse is speaking only of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten</b> and whose blood is presented on the outer altar, <b>as it is stated: “In a sacred place shall it be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:19), the principle is not exclusive to eaten sin offerings. With regard to the blood of <b>both</b> the sin offerings <b>that are eaten and the</b> sin offerings that are wholly burned and not eaten and whose blood is presented on the <b>inner</b> altar, garments sprayed with blood from each of these offerings <b>require laundering. As it is stated</b> at the start of that passage: “This is <b>the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), it is understood: There is <b>one law for all the sin offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | the verse states: “It shall be sprinkled” | Zevachim 92b:5 | <b>Rabba said</b> that there is a different explanation. Internal sin offerings cannot be excluded from the requirement of laundering sprayed garments, as the verse speaks specifically of internal sin offerings, as <b>the verse states: “It shall be sprinkled”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> sin offerings that require <b>sprinklings,</b> and sprinkling is mentioned specifically with regard to internal sin offerings (see Leviticus 4:6), unlike eaten animal sin offerings, with regard to which the Torah uses a term of placing to describe the presenting of its blood (see Leviticus 4:25). |
| Leviticus 6:20 | it shall be sprinkled” | Zevachim 92b:6 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: Can one say that the passage about laundering applies specifically to internal sin offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Although the verse is speaking only of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten,</b> indicating that the passage certainly applies to sin offerings that are eaten? The Gemara answers: The mishna’s statement pertains <b>to the matter of scouring and rinsing</b> copper vessels in which a sin offering was cooked (see Leviticus 6:21), which is relevant only to sin offerings that are eaten. <b>But in the matter of laundering:</b> “You shall launder that on which <b>it shall be sprinkled”</b> (Leviticus 6:20) <b>is written,</b> and the term “it shall be sprinkled” indicates only internal sin offerings. By contrast, eaten sin offerings are included only through the amplification in the verse: “The law of the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:18). |
| Leviticus 6:20 | of its blood | Zevachim 93a:12 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a disqualified sin offering,</b> a garment on which its blood is sprayed does not require laundering, whether the offering had a moment of qualification when its blood was fit for sprinkling or whether it did not have a moment of qualification. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a garment on which the blood of a sin offering sprayed, the verse states: “And when any <b>of its blood</b> shall be sprinkled on a garment” (Leviticus 6:20), teaching that laundering is required when some <b>of the blood of a fit</b> sin offering is sprayed on the garment, <b>but</b> this is <b>not</b> so in the case <b>of the blood of a disqualified</b> sin offering. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> If the sin offering <b>had a period of fitness and</b> then <b>was disqualified,</b> a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed still <b>requires laundering.</b> If it <b>did not have a period of fitness</b> at all <b>and was</b> then <b>disqualified,</b> a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed <b>does not require laundering.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | “Of its blood” | Zevachim 93a:13 | <b>And Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to <b>both this</b> sin offering that had a period of fitness <b>and that</b> sin offering that did not, a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed <b>does not require laundering. What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> in the Torah with regard to laundering the blood of a sin offering: “Every male among the priests may eat <b>it”</b> (Leviticus 6:22), and only it. <b>And it is written</b> earlier in that same section: <b>“Of its blood”</b> (Leviticus 6:20), but not all its blood. Therefore, there are two exclusionary terms; <b>one</b> excludes laundering <b>for</b> the situation <b>where</b> the unfit offering <b>had a period of fitness,</b> and the other excludes a situation in which the offering did not have a period of fitness. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | which it shall be sprinkled” | Zevachim 93a:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites sources for the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in the mishna. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that if blood <b>sprayed from the neck</b> of the animal <b>onto a garment,</b> the garment <b>should require laundering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “On <b>which it shall be sprinkled”</b> (Leviticus 6:20), which teaches: <b>I told you</b> that a garment requires laundering <b>only with regard to</b> blood which is <b>fit for sprinkling,</b> which must be collected in a vessel directly from the neck of the animal. <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that if blood <b>sprayed from the corner or from the base</b> of the altar, the garment <b>should require laundering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “On <b>which it shall be sprinkled,” excluding that</b> blood <b>that was already sprinkled.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | a garment” | Zevachim 93b:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to blood sprayed on a flayed hide, <b>from where are these matters,</b> i.e., the divergent opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, derived? The Gemara explains: They are derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated with regard to laundering: “And when any of its blood shall be sprinkled on <b>a garment”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a garment; from where</b> do I <b>include</b> an animal’s <b>hide after it was flayed? The</b> same <b>verse states: “You shall launder that on which it shall be sprinkled,”</b> to include any item on which the blood sprayed. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | “a garment” | Zevachim 94b:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If the garment became ritually impure outside the curtains, one tears the garment in order to render it ritually pure, enters the courtyard with it, and launders it in a sacred place. <b>Ravina objects to this:</b> How can the mishna say that <b>one tears it? The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that one must launder <b>“a garment”</b> (Leviticus 6:20), <b>and</b> once this article is torn, <b>this is no</b> longer <b>a garment,</b> but only a scrap of cloth. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | in a sacred place” | Zevachim 94b:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The laundering</b> must be performed <b>in a sacred place,</b> and the breaking of an earthenware vessel must be performed in a sacred place, and the scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel must be performed in a sacred place. <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning a garment on which blood was sprayed, the verse states: <b>“You shall launder</b> that on which it shall be sprinkled <b>in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). <b>From where</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the breaking of an earthenware vessel</b> in which a sin offering was cooked derived? <b>The</b> subsequent <b>verse states: “And the earthenware vessel in which it is cooked shall be broken”</b> (Leviticus 6:21). <b>From where</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel</b> in which a sin offering was cooked derived? <b>The verse states</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“And if it be cooked in a copper vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | “Whatever shall touch | Zevachim 97a:21 | § The mishna teaches: In the case of a fit <b>wafer that reached</b> an unfit <b>wafer</b> or a piece of sacrificial meat that touched an unfit piece of sacrificial meat, neither all the wafers nor all the pieces are forbidden. No part is forbidden other than that which is in the place where the item absorbed taste from the unfit wafers or pieces. In relation to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a sin offering, the verse states: <b>“Whatever shall touch</b> its flesh shall be sacred” (Leviticus 6:20). One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies to all contact, <b>even</b> if the other piece <b>did not absorb</b> any flavor from the meat of the sin offering. To counter this, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “With its flesh [<i>bivsarah</i>]”</b> which can also be translated: In its flesh. |
| Leviticus 6:20 | shall touch | Zevachim 97b:2 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if</b> the sin offering <b>touched part of a piece</b> of something that absorbed flavor from the sin offering, <b>the entire</b> piece <b>should become disqualified.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “Whatever <b>shall touch</b> its flesh shall be sacred” (Leviticus 6:20), to teach that only the section <b>that touches</b> the sin offering is <b>disqualified. How so?</b> What can be done with an item when a section of it is disqualified? <b>One slices off the section</b> of the piece <b>that absorbed</b> the disqualified matter. Additionally, the verse states: “Whatever shall touch <b>its flesh,” but</b> an item is <b>not</b> disqualified if it touches the sin offering’s <b>sinews, nor</b> its <b>bones, nor</b> its <b>horns, nor</b> its <b>hooves.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:20 | shall be sacred” | Zevachim 97b:6 | <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> If sacrificial meat touches a disqualified sin offering, this is not simply a case of a positive mitzva in conflict with a prohibition. Because the verse states: “Whatever shall touch its flesh <b>shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 6:20), treating the item as consecrated <b>is</b> itself <b>a positive mitzva.</b> Consequently, both a positive mitzva and a prohibition stand in opposition to eating that sacrificial meat, <b>and a positive mitzva does not override</b> both <b>a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:21 | also | Avodah Zarah76a:6 | <b>Rava</b> disagreed, <b>saying: Ultimately,</b> even in the case of sacrificial meat, <b>when it emits</b> flavor, <b>it emits a forbidden</b> flavor, so what difference does it make that it was permitted when it was absorbed? <b>Rather, Rava said: What</b> is meant by the <b>purging</b> stated with regard to sacrificial meat? It means that besides heating it until white-hot, <b>rinsing and scouring</b> it are <b>also</b> required, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to any utensil used with sacrificial meat, as the verse states: “It shall be scoured and rinsed in water” (Leviticus 6:21). |
| Leviticus 6:21 | verse states: “And the earthenware vessel in which it is cooked shall be broken” | Zevachim 94b:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The laundering</b> must be performed <b>in a sacred place,</b> and the breaking of an earthenware vessel must be performed in a sacred place, and the scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel must be performed in a sacred place. <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning a garment on which blood was sprayed, the verse states: <b>“You shall launder</b> that on which it shall be sprinkled <b>in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). <b>From where</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the breaking of an earthenware vessel</b> in which a sin offering was cooked derived? <b>The</b> subsequent <b>verse states: “And the earthenware vessel in which it is cooked shall be broken”</b> (Leviticus 6:21). <b>From where</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel</b> in which a sin offering was cooked derived? <b>The verse states</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“And if it be cooked in a copper vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:21 | vessel… | Zevachim 95a:2 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>an earthenware vessel</b> in which a sin offering was cooked <b>that went outside</b> the curtains and became ritually impure outside the curtains, one punctures the vessel to render it ritually pure, brings the vessel back into the courtyard, and breaks it there. The Gemara asks: Why is there a need to break the earthenware vessel after puncturing it? <b>The Merciful One states:</b> “The earthenware <b>vessel…</b>shall be broken” (Leviticus 6:21), <b>and,</b> once it is punctured, <b>it is not a vessel.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>When it is punctured</b> with a hole only the size <b>of a small root,</b> the earthenware vessel is purified from the ritual impurity it contracted, but it remains a vessel for other purposes, such as holding fruit. |
| Leviticus 6:21 | “In which it is cooked” | Zevachim 95b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Concerning the statement in the mishna that these <i>halakhot</i> also apply to a vessel into which a boiling cooked dish was poured, the Gemara notes that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a sin offering, the verse states: <b>“In which it is cooked”</b> (Leviticus 6:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> this applies to a vessel <b>in which</b> one <b>cooked</b> the sin offering. <b>From where</b> do I derive that it applies also to a vessel <b>into which</b> one <b>poured a boiling</b> cooked dish? <b>The verse states</b> more fully: <b>“But</b> the earthenware vessel <b>in which it is cooked shall be broken.”</b> Since the verse employs the phrase: “In which it is…shall be broken,” that teaches that if the hot meat is in the vessel, whether cooked or poured into the vessel, these <i>halakhot</i> apply to it, and if it is an earthenware vessel it must be broken. |
| Leviticus 6:21 | in water” | Zevachim 96b:15 | <b>Rava said:</b> When the verse excludes <i>teruma</i> from the <i>halakha</i> of scouring and rinsing, that <b>is necessary only for</b> that <b>which the Master said:</b> The verse specifies: “It shall be scoured and rinsed <b>in water”</b> (Leviticus 6:21), <b>but</b> the vessel is <b>not</b> to be scoured and rinsed <b>in wine.</b> It must be scoured and rinsed <b>“in water,” but not in diluted</b> wine. By contrast, in <b>this</b> case, i.e., the vessel in which <i>teruma</i> was cooked, it may be scoured and rinsed <b>even in wine, and even in diluted</b> wine. |
| Leviticus 6:21 | the verse states: “And if it be cooked in a copper vessel, | Zevachim 96b:9 | Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him: If</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it. The Gemara then clarifies: <b>And what is the reason</b> that an entire vessel requires scouring and rinsing even if one cooked the meat of an offering in only part of the vessel? The reason is that <b>the verse states: “And if it be cooked in a copper vessel,</b> it shall be scoured and rinsed in water” (Leviticus 6:21). From the phrase “in a copper vessel” it is derived that <b>even</b> if the meat is cooked <b>in</b> only <b>part of a vessel,</b> the entire vessel must be scoured and rinsed. |
| Leviticus 6:21 | “It shall be scoured and rinsed | Zevachim 97a:7 | <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Abba Yosei bar Abba: It is written</b> about a copper vessel in which a sin offering was cooked: <b>“It shall be scoured and rinsed</b> in water” (Leviticus 6:21); <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Every male among the priests may eat</b> it.” <b>How so,</b> i.e., what are the verses teaching through this juxtaposition? One <b>waits with it until</b> the end of <b>the period of partaking and then performs scouring and rinsing on it.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:22 | is explicitly written | Menachot 83a:1 | this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written</b> of them. With regard to the sin offering, it is stated: “Every male among the priests may eat it” (Leviticus 6:22), and with regard to the guilt offering, it is stated: “Every male among the priests may eat of it” (Leviticus 7:6). |
| Leviticus 6:22 | “Every male | Zevachim 102a:21 | It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering: <b>“Every male</b> among the priests may eat thereof” (Leviticus 6:22). The phrase “every male” serves <b>to include blemished</b> priests. The Gemara explains: <b>For what</b> matter is this derivation necessary? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>consumption, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated</b> in Leviticus, chapter 21? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>receiving a share, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated</b> in verse 6:11? Rather, the verse is necessary <b>because</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a priest who was at first <b>unblemished and</b> later <b>became blemished. From where</b> is it derived that one <b>blemished from birth</b> also receives a share? <b>The verse states</b> here: <b>“Every male.”</b> |
| Leviticus 6:22 | it” | Zevachim 93a:13 | <b>And Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to <b>both this</b> sin offering that had a period of fitness <b>and that</b> sin offering that did not, a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed <b>does not require laundering. What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> in the Torah with regard to laundering the blood of a sin offering: “Every male among the priests may eat <b>it”</b> (Leviticus 6:22), and only it. <b>And it is written</b> earlier in that same section: <b>“Of its blood”</b> (Leviticus 6:20), but not all its blood. Therefore, there are two exclusionary terms; <b>one</b> excludes laundering <b>for</b> the situation <b>where</b> the unfit offering <b>had a period of fitness,</b> and the other excludes a situation in which the offering did not have a period of fitness. |
| Leviticus 6:22 | it is most sacred” | Zevachim 96b:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Whether</b> the meat is from <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> or whether it is from offerings of lesser sanctity, the vessels in which it is cooked must be scoured and rinsed. The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sages taught:</b> The Torah introduces the mitzva of scouring and rinsing with the qualifying statement: “This is the law of the <b>sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to scouring and rinsing applies to vessels in which <b>a sin offering</b> was cooked. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this <i>halakha</i> applies to vessels used for <b>all sacrificial</b> meat? <b>The verse states:</b> “Every male among the priests may eat of it; <b>it is most sacred”</b> (Leviticus 6:22), to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies to vessels used for all of the sacrificial meat that the priests eat. |
| Leviticus 6:22 | of it; | Zevachim 96b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include</b> vessels used for cooking <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, as well, as it is also sacred and may be eaten only by a priest (see Leviticus 22:14). To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “Every male among the priests may eat <b>of it;</b> it is most sacred” (Leviticus 6:22). The emphatic qualifier “of it” <b>excludes <i>teruma</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: Offerings of the most sacred order require scouring and rinsing,</b> but <b>offerings of lesser sanctity do not require scouring and rinsing, as it is written: “Most sacred.”</b> Accordingly, with regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order, yes,</b> scouring and rinsing is required; but for <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, no,</b> it is not required. |
| Leviticus 6:22 | is explicitly written of them. | Zevachim 97b:10 | The Gemara continues to expound the aforementioned verse (Leviticus 7:37). When the verse mentions <b>a meal offering,</b> it teaches that <b>just as a meal offering is eaten only by males of</b> the <b>priesthood</b> (see Leviticus 6:9–11), <b>so too are all</b> of the offerings mentioned in this verse <b>eaten only by males of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what</b> offering <b>is it</b> that this <i>halakha</i> must be derived? <b>If</b> one suggests it is with regard to the <b>sin offering and</b> the <b>guilt offering,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written of them.</b> With regard to the sin offering, it is stated: “Every male among the priests may eat it” (Leviticus 6:22); and with regard to the guilt offering, it is stated: <b>“Every male among the priests may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:6). |
| Leviticus 6:22 | “Every male among the priests | Zevachim 99a:4 | The Gemara objects: But there is <b>a blemished priest, who is unfit for effecting atonement, and</b> yet he <b>receives a share</b> of its meat. The Gemara replies: <b>The Merciful One included a blemished</b> priest as an exception, as the verse that states: <b>“Every male among the priests</b> shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:22), serves <b>to include a blemished</b> priest. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | As it is written: “And no sin-offering, of which any of the blood is brought | Pesachim 23b:12 | The Gemara responds: This Sage <b>holds</b> that the prohibition to derive benefit from <b>non-sacrificial animals that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard is by Torah law,</b> and that it is the word “it” in the verse that indicates they are prohibited. And <b>from where</b> is it derived that this prohibition against deriving benefit applies to leavened bread and to an ox that is stoned as well? <b>As it is written: “And no sin-offering, of which any of the blood is brought</b> into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the sacred place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire” (Leviticus 6:23). |
| Leviticus 6:23 | the verse said: “In the sacred place…shall be burnt with fire” | Pesachim 24a:2 | The Gemara continues: <b>Lest</b> one say that the verse indicates that <b>just as here,</b> the sin-offering is disposed of <b>with burning, so too, all the prohibited</b> items <b>in the Torah</b> must be disposed of <b>with burning,</b> therefore <b>the verse said: “In the sacred place…shall be burnt with fire”</b> (Leviticus 6:23). This indicates that only that which is disqualified <b>in the sacred place</b> is disposed of <b>with burning, but all</b> other <b>prohibited</b> items <b>in the Torah</b> need <b>not</b> be disposed of <b>with burning.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:23 | from the first verse | Pesachim 24a:7 | <b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> <b>from the first verse</b> cited by Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: “And any sin-offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the sacred place, shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire” (Leviticus 6:23). <b>And reverse</b> the construct of his exposition. <b>Let</b> the verse <b>write: “It shall be burnt with fire,” and it</b> will <b>not need</b> to write: <b>“Shall not be eaten.”</b> For <b>what</b> purpose then does <b>the verse state: “It shall not be eaten”? If it does not apply to</b> the subject <b>matter itself, as that was</b> already <b>derived from</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> that whatever has been rendered disqualified in the sacred place may not be eaten, <b>apply it to all</b> other <b>prohibitions in the Torah,</b> including leavened bread on Passover and a stoned ox. <b>And if it does not</b> apply to the prohibition against <b>eating,</b> which is written explicitly, then <b>apply it to the prohibition of</b> deriving <b>benefit.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:23 | it shall be burned in fire” | Pesachim 82b:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>We derive it from</b> the exposition of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse that states: “Any sin-offering from which some blood has been brought to the Tent of Meeting, to make atonement <b>in the sacred place,</b> shall not be eaten; <b>it shall be burned in fire”</b> (Leviticus 6:23), <b>has taught that the burning of a sin-offering is in the sacred</b> area, the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The entire matter | Pesachim 83a:1 | <b>Rabba adds</b> that these tanna’im were not the only ones who maintain this opinion; <b>even Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> agreed with them, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The entire matter</b> that is stated in the verse: “Any sin-offering from which some blood has been brought to the Tent of Meeting, to make atonement in the sacred place, shall not be eaten; it shall be burned in fire” (Leviticus 6:23) is not stated with regard to a regular sin-offering improperly brought inside the Sanctuary; rather, it <b>speaks only about bulls that are burned and goats that are burned.</b> These are unique sin-offerings, and the Torah states that their blood should be brought inside the Sanctuary. The verse is stated with regard to these sin-offerings both in order to command the Jewish people <b>to burn the disqualified ones in the place of the <i>bira</i></b> on the Temple Mount <b>and</b> in order <b>to establish a prohibition with regard to their consumption.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:23 | whose blood | Zevachim 11a:8 | <b>Rather, this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis: As the verse states:</b> “And any sin offering, any of <b>whose blood</b> is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). The term “whose blood” teaches that <b>the blood of this</b> offering, i.e., a sin offering, <b>and not the blood of another</b> offering, is disqualified in this manner. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | sin offering alone, | Zevachim 81b:15 | If the priest, on his own initiative, placed the mixture of blood <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and again placed</b> the mixture of blood <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> the blood placed outside <b>disqualified, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>fit. As Rabbi Akiva says: Any blood</b> that is to be presented outside <b>that entered to atone in the Sanctuary is disqualified; but the Rabbis say:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of an external <b>sin offering alone,</b> as it is written: “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The status of <b>a guilt offering</b> is like that of a sin offering <b>as well, as it is stated: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), i.e., there is one <i>halakha</i> for them. That is not the case with regard to the blood of other offerings. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | whereof any of the blood is brought | Zevachim 82a:18 | The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: <b>But</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And any sin offering, <b>whereof any of the blood is brought</b> into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). This indicates that <b>even</b> if <b>part of its blood</b> is brought inside the Sanctuary, the sin offering is disqualified. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | that Rabbi Akiva would say: | Zevachim 82a:2 | § The mishna teaches <b>that Rabbi Akiva would say:</b> Any blood that is to be presented outside that entered to atone in the Sanctuary is disqualified. The Gemara discusses the source for Rabbi Akiva’s ruling. The verse states: “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). How does Rabbi Akiva apply this <i>halakha</i> to all offerings whose blood is presented on the external altar? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> Hear <b>a parable: To what is this matter comparable? To a student who mixed</b> wine <b>with hot water for his teacher. And</b> the teacher <b>said to him: Mix</b> another drink <b>for me.</b> The student <b>said to him: With what</b> should I mix the wine, hot or cold water? The teacher <b>said to him: Aren’t we dealing with hot</b> water? <b>Now</b> that I requested that you mix me another cup, I mean that you should mix it <b>either in hot</b> water <b>or in cold.</b> Otherwise, the teacher would not have needed to say anything. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | is brought | Zevachim 82a:20 | The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili in response: <b>But</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood <b>is brought</b> into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). This teaches that only blood <b>that enters</b> the Sanctuary <b>disqualifies</b> the blood in the courtyard, <b>but</b> the blood <b>that leaves</b> the courtyard <b>does not disqualify</b> the blood in the courtyard. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | sin offering, | Zevachim 82a:6 | Rav Huna continues: <b>Rather, the reasoning of Rabbi Akiva</b> is <b>from</b> the fact that the verse does not state simply: <b>“Sin offering,” but</b> states: <b>“Any sin offering”;</b> this serves to include all other offerings. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And any <b>sin offering,</b> whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). <b>I have</b> derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering; from where</b> is it derived that it also applies to <b>offerings of the most sacred order? The verse states: “Any sin offering.” And from where</b> is it derived that it also applies to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity? The verse states: “And any sin offering.”</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:23 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: As we have found the entire matter | Zevachim 82a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili hold</b> that <b>this verse comes for this</b> purpose, to teach the <i>halakha</i> of sin offerings whose blood was brought inside the Sanctuary? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: As we have found the entire matter</b> that is stated in the verse: “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 6:23), is not stated with regard to a standard sin offering improperly brought inside the Sanctuary; rather, it <b>speaks only about bulls that are burned and goats that are burned.</b> |
| Leviticus 6:23 | of the blood | Zevachim 82b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> explains that one does not derive this inference, as the verse <b>states:</b> “And any sin offering, whereof any <b>of the blood</b> is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23), which indicates that the <b>blood of</b> an offering that is brought inside is disqualified, <b>but not meat</b> that enters the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | to atone in the Sanctuary, | Zevachim 83a:3 | § The mishna teaches that the Sages disagree as to the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the priest carrying the blood of a sin offering whose blood placement is on the external altar <b>entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to atone</b> through sprinkling, but in practice the priest did not actually sprinkle the blood. According to Rabbi Eliezer the blood is disqualified, whereas Rabbi Shimon maintains that the blood is disqualified only if the priest sprinkles it in the Sanctuary. Concerning this, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here:</b> “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting <b>to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the service of the High Priest on Yom Kippur: <b>“And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when he goes in to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> until he comes out” (Leviticus 16:17). |
| Leviticus 6:23 | Rabbi Shimon says: It is stated here: “To atone” | Zevachim 83a:5 | Conversely, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is stated here: “To atone”</b> (Leviticus 6:23), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the conclusion of the service on Yom Kippur: <b>“And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to atone</b> in the Sanctuary, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn in the fire” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>Just as there,</b> the phrase “to atone” is referring <b>to</b> the stage <b>when</b> he has already <b>atoned,</b> as the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned after their blood has been sprinkled, <b>so too here,</b> the phrase “to atone” is referring <b>to</b> a situation <b>where</b> he has already <b>atoned,</b> whereas merely bringing the blood into the Sanctuary does not disqualify it. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | “In the sacred place…it shall be burned with fire” | Zevachim 92a:3 | § <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to wine <b>libations that became ritually impure, one prepares for them an arrangement</b> of wood <b>by themselves and burns them</b> there, without removing them from the Temple courtyard. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to a disqualified sin offering: <b>“In the sacred place…it shall be burned with fire”</b> (Leviticus 6:23). This requirement of burning in the sacred place applies to all offerings that are meant to be sacrificed on an altar and became disqualified. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the blood, the oil, the meal offerings, and the libations that became ritually impure, one prepares for them an arrangement</b> of wood <b>by themselves and burns them</b> there. |
| Leviticus 6:23 | “Of whose blood | Zevachim 92b:12 | <b>Or perhaps</b> is its neck <b>comparable to the neck of</b> a large <b>animal</b> offering, about which <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“Of whose blood</b> is brought into the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 6:23), which teaches that its blood is disqualified when brought inside in a service vessel, <b>but</b> the blood is <b>not</b> disqualified when the animal’s <b>flesh</b> is brought inside. What is the status of the bird’s neck? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If, after its nape is pinched, a bird sin offering <b>convulsed and</b> consequently <b>entered inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and</b> then it <b>returned</b> to the courtyard, it remains <b>valid;</b> its blood may be sprinkled and its meat eaten. It can be inferred that the bird offering remains valid if it has entered on its own, <b>but</b> if a priest has <b>brought it in,</b> it is <b>disqualified</b> because of the blood in its neck. |
| Leviticus 7:1 | “This is the law of the guilt offering” | Keritot 22b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the provisional <b>guilt offering</b> must be worth at least two <b>silver shekels from</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1). This teaches that there is <b>one law for all of the guilt offerings,</b> and therefore each <b>guilt offering</b> must be <b>worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b> Since it is not necessary for him to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the juxtaposition of the passages concerning misuse of consecrated property and the provisional guilt offering, and the verbal analogy cannot entirely negate the comparison indicated by this juxtaposition, Rabbi Akiva derives from the juxtaposition that one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 7:1 | and: “This is the law of the guilt offering” | Menachot 110a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), <b>and: “This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1)? These verses teach that <b>anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of the sin offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a sin offering, and anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of a guilt offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a guilt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:1 | “And this is the law of the guilt offering” | Zevachim 48a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive <b>this conclusion?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse that states: <b>“And this is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1), which teaches that there is <b>one law for all of the guilt offerings</b> and they must all be worth at least two shekels, provisional guilt offerings included. |
| Leviticus 7:2 | “And its blood | Zevachim 49a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the one who <b>collects</b> the blood must <b>himself</b> stand in the north? The Gemara answers: It is derived from the fact that the verse does not only state: <b>“Its blood</b> shall be sprinkled,” but states: <b>“And its blood</b> shall be sprinkled” (Leviticus 7:2). The conjunction “and [<i>ve’et</i>]” serves to include the one who collects the blood. |
| Leviticus 7:2 | As it is written: “In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they shall slaughter the guilt offering, | Zevachim 49a:8 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that a guilt offering,</b> which is an offering of the most sacred order, <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they shall slaughter the guilt offering,</b> and its blood shall be sprinkled around the altar” (Leviticus 7:2). Since the burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north, the guilt offering must also be slaughtered in the north. |
| Leviticus 7:2 | a guilt offering, there are three | Zevachim 57a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common aspect with regard to other cases. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one do <b>teach</b> their common aspect with regard to other cases, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: Together with the verse stated with regard to <b>a guilt offering, there are three</b> verses, as it is written: “And its blood shall be sprinkled around the altar” (Leviticus 7:2), <b>and three</b> verses which come as one <b>certainly do not teach</b> their common aspect with regard to other cases. |
| Leviticus 7:5 | “It,” | Menachot 4a:17 | The Gemara challenges: But if so, concerning <b>a guilt offering as well, it is written about</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> as the verse states: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5). Accordingly, a guilt offering should likewise be disqualified if it is slaughtered not for its own sake. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> term <b>“it” is written with regard to</b> the stage <b>after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions [<i>eimurin</i>]</b> of a guilt offering, which are intended for burning upon the altar. |
| Leviticus 7:5 | “it” is stated with regard to a guilt offering as well, | Zevachim 10b:3 | And the word <b>“it” is stated with regard to a guilt offering as well,</b> in the verse: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5). Here too, say that the word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:5 | “it” written with regard to a guilt offering as well, | Zevachim 12b:11 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t the word <b>“it” written with regard to a guilt offering as well,</b> in the verse: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5)? Nevertheless, a guilt offering sacrificed not for its sake is not disqualified. |
| Leviticus 7:5 | it | Zevachim 5b:11 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>also written with regard to a guilt offering:</b> “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord; <b>it</b> is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5)? Why is a guilt offering not disqualified when it is slaughtered not for its sake? |
| Leviticus 7:6 | “Every male | Zevachim 102a:22 | It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the guilt offering: <b>“Every male</b> among the priests may eat thereof” (Leviticus 7:6). The phrase “every male” serves <b>to include a blemished</b> priest. The Gemara explains: <b>For what</b> matter is this derivation necessary? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>eating, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated? And if</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>receiving a share, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated? And if</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> a priest <b>blemished from birth, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated?</b> Rather, the verse is necessary <b>because</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a permanently blemished</b> priest. <b>From where</b> is it derived that a <b>temporarily blemished</b> priest also receives a share? <b>The verse states</b> here: <b>“Every male.”</b> |
| Leviticus 7:6 | “Every male among the priests may eat of it” | Zevachim 97b:10 | The Gemara continues to expound the aforementioned verse (Leviticus 7:37). When the verse mentions <b>a meal offering,</b> it teaches that <b>just as a meal offering is eaten only by males of</b> the <b>priesthood</b> (see Leviticus 6:9–11), <b>so too are all</b> of the offerings mentioned in this verse <b>eaten only by males of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what</b> offering <b>is it</b> that this <i>halakha</i> must be derived? <b>If</b> one suggests it is with regard to the <b>sin offering and</b> the <b>guilt offering,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written of them.</b> With regard to the sin offering, it is stated: “Every male among the priests may eat it” (Leviticus 6:22); and with regard to the guilt offering, it is stated: <b>“Every male among the priests may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:6). |
| Leviticus 7:7 | guilt offering to a sin offering, | Menachot 28a:3 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, and that</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> He explains: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is the <i>tanna</i> <b>who juxtaposes</b> the <b>guilt offering to a sin offering,</b> teaching that just as a sin offering is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake, so too, the guilt offering, such as the leper’s guilt offering, is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake, as it is written: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; there is one law for them” (Leviticus 7:7). He <b>also juxtaposes</b> the <b><i>log</i></b> of oil of the leper <b>to</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> of the leper in the same verse, teaching that if the sprinkling from the <i>log</i> of oil was performed not for its own sake, it is not valid. In contrast, <b>the Rabbis do not juxtapose</b> the guilt offering to the sin offering, and therefore they have no reason to invalidate the sprinkling from the leper’s <i>log</i> of oil that is performed not for its own sake. |
| Leviticus 7:7 | he shall have to himself” | Zevachim 103b:11 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“Shall have to himself,”</b> as does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that the phrase teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> It <b>is stated: “Shall have to himself”</b> (Leviticus 7:8), <b>with regard to a burnt offering, and</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “The priest that makes atonement, <b>he shall have to himself”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), <b>with regard to a guilt offering.</b> The following verbal analogy is derived from here: <b>Just as there,</b> after the blood of a guilt offering is presented, <b>its bones</b> become <b>permitted</b> to the priest for any use, since only the portions intended for consumption on the altar are sacrificed whereas the rest of the animal is given to the priests, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a burnt offering, <b>its bones</b> that are not attached to the flesh and are therefore not intended for the altar <b>are permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:7 | as it is stated: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering” | Zevachim 10b:32 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (81b): <b>As Rabbi Akiva would say: Any blood that</b> should have been sprinkled on the external altar but instead <b>entered to atone in the Sanctuary</b> is <b>unfit. And the Rabbis say:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to the blood of <b>a sin offering. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The halakhic status of <b>a guilt offering</b> is <b>also</b> like that of a sin offering, <b>as it is stated: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:7). |
| Leviticus 7:7 | states: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering” | Zevachim 10b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him:</b> A sin offering and a guilt offering are juxtaposed in the verse that <b>states: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:7). The verse teaches that <b>just as a sin offering</b> sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit, so too, a guilt offering</b> sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:7 | Rabbi Eliezer, who says: We juxtapose a guilt offering with a sin offering | Zevachim 115a:6 | <b>And</b> although there is ostensibly no need for an additional verse from which to derive the <i>halakha</i> in this case, as a guilt offering that was slaughtered not for its sake inside the courtyard is fit for sacrifice, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says: We juxtapose a guilt offering with a sin offering</b> in the verse: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; there is one law for them” (Leviticus 7:7), from which it may be derived that they have equivalent halakhic status. Therefore, a guilt offering that was slaughtered not for its sake is disqualified, and consequently one might say that one who slaughters a guilt offering not for its sake outside the Temple courtyard is exempt, as it is not fit for sacrifice. Therefore, the derivation from the verse is necessary. |
| Leviticus 7:7 | as well, as it is stated: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering” | Zevachim 81b:15 | If the priest, on his own initiative, placed the mixture of blood <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and again placed</b> the mixture of blood <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> the blood placed outside <b>disqualified, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>fit. As Rabbi Akiva says: Any blood</b> that is to be presented outside <b>that entered to atone in the Sanctuary is disqualified; but the Rabbis say:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of an external <b>sin offering alone,</b> as it is written: “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The status of <b>a guilt offering</b> is like that of a sin offering <b>as well, as it is stated: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), i.e., there is one <i>halakha</i> for them. That is not the case with regard to the blood of other offerings. |
| Leviticus 7:7 | he shall have it” | Zevachim 86a:7 | The Gemara elaborates: Rabba <b>holds in accordance with that which Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> It <b>is stated: “He shall have</b> the hide of the burnt offering that he has offered” (Leviticus 7:8), <b>with regard to a burnt offering, and</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “The priest that makes atonement, <b>he shall have it”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), <b>with regard to a guilt offering.</b> The following verbal analogy is derived from here: <b>Just as</b> after the blood of <b>a guilt offering</b> is presented <b>its bones</b> become <b>permitted</b> to the priest for any use, since only the portions intended for consumption on the altar are sacrificed whereas the rest of the animal is given to the priests, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering, bones</b> that are not attached to the flesh and therefore are not intended for the altar are <b>permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:8 | a man’s burnt offering, | Zevachim 103a:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>any</b> burnt offering <b>for which the altar did not acquire its flesh,</b> e.g., if it was disqualified prior to the sprinkling of its blood, the <b>priests did not acquire its hide, as it is stated</b> with regard to the burnt offering: “And the priest that sacrifices <b>a man’s burnt offering,</b> the priest shall have to himself the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed” (Leviticus 7:8), indicating that the priest acquires only the hide of <b>a burnt offering that satisfied</b> the obligation <b>of a man.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:8 | a man’s burnt offering, | Zevachim 103a:18 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the priest that offers <b>a man’s burnt offering,</b> the priest shall have to himself the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed” (Leviticus 7:8). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a man’s burnt offering,</b> i.e., that of a born-Jewish male. <b>From where</b> is the same derived with regard to <b>the burnt offering of converts, women, or</b> Canaanite <b>slaves? The verse states: “The hide of the burnt offering,”</b> and it thereby <b>included</b> these as well. |
| Leviticus 7:8 | is stated: “Shall have to himself” | Zevachim 103b:11 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“Shall have to himself,”</b> as does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that the phrase teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> It <b>is stated: “Shall have to himself”</b> (Leviticus 7:8), <b>with regard to a burnt offering, and</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “The priest that makes atonement, <b>he shall have to himself”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), <b>with regard to a guilt offering.</b> The following verbal analogy is derived from here: <b>Just as there,</b> after the blood of a guilt offering is presented, <b>its bones</b> become <b>permitted</b> to the priest for any use, since only the portions intended for consumption on the altar are sacrificed whereas the rest of the animal is given to the priests, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a burnt offering, <b>its bones</b> that are not attached to the flesh and are therefore not intended for the altar <b>are permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:8 | the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed” | Zevachim 103b:7 | <b>But with regard to a burnt offering it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces”</b> (Leviticus 1:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that, because all the flesh of the burnt offering is burned on the altar, <b>the priests have no right to its hide.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “The priest shall have to himself <b>the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed”</b> (Leviticus 7:8). |
| Leviticus 7:8 | is stated: “He shall have | Zevachim 86a:7 | The Gemara elaborates: Rabba <b>holds in accordance with that which Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> It <b>is stated: “He shall have</b> the hide of the burnt offering that he has offered” (Leviticus 7:8), <b>with regard to a burnt offering, and</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “The priest that makes atonement, <b>he shall have it”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), <b>with regard to a guilt offering.</b> The following verbal analogy is derived from here: <b>Just as</b> after the blood of <b>a guilt offering</b> is presented <b>its bones</b> become <b>permitted</b> to the priest for any use, since only the portions intended for consumption on the altar are sacrificed whereas the rest of the animal is given to the priests, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering, bones</b> that are not attached to the flesh and therefore are not intended for the altar are <b>permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:9 | “oven” | Menachot 63a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In this verse it states <b>“oven,”</b> and it also states <b>“oven”</b> in another verse: “And every meal offering that is baked in the oven” (Leviticus 7:9). Since it is written <b>two times,</b> and these terms are restrictions, one follows the hermeneutical principle that a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression serves only to amplify the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. Consequently, this derivation serves <b>to render fit</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>,</b> and it too is deemed an oven. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The terms <b>“oven”</b> and <b>“oven,”</b> which are written a total of <b>two times,</b> serve to teach two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One</b> instance teaches <b>that their baking should be in an oven, and</b> the other <b>one</b> teaches <b>that their consecration is in an oven,</b> i.e., meal offerings are not consecrated in service vessels but rather in the oven. |
| Leviticus 7:9 | “And all that is made in the marḥeshet ” | Menachot 63a:4 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says</b> that a <i>marḥeshet</i> is deep, whereas a <i>maḥavat</i> is flat. The Gemara explains the reason for this opinion: <b>A <i>marḥeshet</i></b> is <b>deep, as it is written</b> with regard to this meal offering: <b>“And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). The use of the term “in” indicates that this meal offering is prepared inside a vessel, i.e., a deep container. Conversely, <b>a <i>maḥavat</i></b> is flat, with the sides of the pan <b>level</b> with the pan, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to this meal offering: <b>“And on the <i>maḥavat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). The use of the term “on” indicates that it is prepared on the vessel, not inside it. Therefore, a flat vessel is required. |
| Leviticus 7:9 | “And all that is made in the marḥeshet and on the maḥavat ” | Menachot 63a:8 | <b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> two different prepositions with regard to these vessels: <b>“And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i> and on the <i>maḥavat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). It does not state simply: And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i> and the <i>maḥavat</i>. Since it seems from the verse that when using the <i>marḥeshet</i> the meal offering is prepared inside the vessel and when using the <i>maḥavat</i> it is prepared on the vessel, <b>evidently they are called</b> these names <b>due to</b> the <b>vessel</b> in which the meal offering is prepared, <b>not due to</b> the manner of <b>their preparation.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:9 | “And every” | Menachot 63b:4 | The verses juxtapose the meal offering baked in an oven to the meal offering prepared on the pan and the meal offering prepared in the deep pan, and similarly to the meal offering brought as a gift, alluded to by the phrase: “Mixed with oil,” and to the meal offering of a sinner, which is called: “Dry.” This teaches that <b>just as</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>stated below</b> with regard to those meal offerings, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, <b>so too,</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), <b>stated above,</b> with regard to the two forms of meal offering baked in an oven, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, and therefore one may not bring part as loaves and part as wafers. |
| Leviticus 7:9 | shall be the priest’s that offers it” | Sukkah 56a:1 | <b>The verse states: “They shall have like portions to eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:8); just <b>as</b> all the watches receive an equal <b>portion of the service, so too</b> all the watches receive an equal <b>portion</b> in the <b>eating.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>eating</b> mentioned in this verse? <b>If you say</b> it is the eating of <b>offerings,</b> the verse is superfluous, as it is <b>derived from there:</b> “And every meal-offering…<b>shall be the priest’s that offers it”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), which, although it was written with regard to meal-offerings, applies to all offerings. Moreover, it teaches that a priest who participates in the sacrifice of the offering shares in eating the offering. <b>Rather,</b> the verse is referring to <b>the shewbread</b> that was not part of the service this Shabbat, as it was baked the previous Shabbat. |
| Leviticus 7:9 | shall be the priest’s that offers it” | Zevachim 102b:12 | The pure priest responded: The verse <b>states:</b> “And every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing pan, and on the griddle, <b>shall be the priest’s that offers it”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). If you wish to receive a share of a meal offering, <b>come sacrifice and partake</b> of one. Since you cannot sacrifice a meal offering, having immersed only today, neither can you receive a share. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | verse states: “And every meal-offering mingled with oil…shall all the sons of Aaron | Kiddushin 53a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>bird</b>-offerings <b>in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings because the actions,</b> i.e., killing, of <b>these</b> birds is <b>by hand,</b> by pinching the neck, <b>and the actions,</b> i.e., killing, of <b>those</b> animals is <b>with a utensil,</b> by slaughtering with a knife. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of <b>meal-offerings in exchange for</b> portions of other <b>meal-offerings, since the actions with</b> both <b>these and those</b> are <b>by hand.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse states: “And every meal-offering mingled with oil…shall all the sons of Aaron</b> have” (Leviticus 7:10). |
| Leviticus 7:10 | verse states: “Or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have” | Kiddushin 53a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of a meal-offering prepared on <b>a griddle in exchange for</b> portions of a meal<b>-</b>offering prepared in <b>a deep pan, or</b> portions of a meal-offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal<b>-</b>offering prepared on <b>a griddle, since the actions</b> with <b>this</b> deep pan result in <b>a soft</b> product, <b>and the actions</b> with <b>that</b> griddle result in <b>a hard</b> product. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of a meal-offering prepared on <b>a griddle in exchange for</b> the portions of a meal-offering prepared on <b>a griddle, or</b> a share of a meal-offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal-offering prepared in <b>a deep pan, since the actions</b> with both <b>these and those</b> result in <b>a hard</b> product, in the case of a griddle, or <b>alternatively,</b> with regard to a deep pan, <b>the actions</b> result in <b>a soft</b> product. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10). |
| Leviticus 7:10 | one as well as another” | Kiddushin 53a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that they <b>may not receive a share of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., meal-offerings, in exchange for a portion of another similar offering, <b>but they may receive a share of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> in exchange for a portion of another similar offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to meal-offerings: “Shall all the sons of Aaron have, <b>one as well as another”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>and near it</b> appears the verse: <b>“If</b> he offers it <b>for a thanks-offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), from which is derived: <b>Just as one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of the most sacred order, so too, one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a thanks-offering. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, | Menachot 103b:15 | The Sages <b>said to him: You</b> should <b>state</b> a reason why a meal offering of more than sixty tenths of an ephah must be brought in more than one vessel. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: It says</b> in the Torah: <b>“And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry,</b> shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:10). <b>The Torah has already stated</b> here: <b>Bring a meal offering that is capable of being mixed.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:10 | is written: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil” | Menachot 3b:16 | The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the <b>offering itself is called <i>shelamim</i>, as it is written: “Who sacrifices the blood of the peace offering [<i>shelamim</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and it is also written: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14). <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>is a meal offering itself called mixed?</b> It <b>is written: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), indicating that there is a meal offering that <b>is called: Mixed with oil,</b> but <b>it is not simply called: Mixed.</b> One’s intent to sacrifice a dry meal offering for the sake of mixing is therefore not a reference to the offering itself. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | “dry” | Menachot 54a:6 | The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> as <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they</b> currently <b>are. And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree: As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, <b>holds: What</b> is the meaning of <b>“dry”</b> written in the verse discussing a meal offering: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry” (Leviticus 7:10)? It means <b>dry of oil,</b> but one may add water. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ila, <b>holds</b> that the meal offering of a sinner must be <b>dry of all substances,</b> i.e., it may not contain even water. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | “And every” | Menachot 63b:4 | The verses juxtapose the meal offering baked in an oven to the meal offering prepared on the pan and the meal offering prepared in the deep pan, and similarly to the meal offering brought as a gift, alluded to by the phrase: “Mixed with oil,” and to the meal offering of a sinner, which is called: “Dry.” This teaches that <b>just as</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>stated below</b> with regard to those meal offerings, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, <b>so too,</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), <b>stated above,</b> with regard to the two forms of meal offering baked in an oven, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, and therefore one may not bring part as loaves and part as wafers. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | as the verse states: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have” | Menachot 72b:27 | The Gemara answers. <b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> The source is from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10). The verse is analyzed: <b>If</b> it <b>is not</b> necessary for <b>the matter of a mixed</b> meal offering <b>of wheat,</b> which is derived from the verse cited earlier, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a mixed</b> meal offering <b>of barley,</b> i.e., the meal offering of the <i>omer</i>. <b>And if</b> the verse <b>is not</b> necessary for <b>the matter of a dry</b> meal offering <b>of wheat,</b> which is derived from the verse cited earlier, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a dry</b> meal offering <b>of barley,</b> i.e., the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | verse states: “And every meal offering mixed with oil…shall all the sons of Aaron have” | Menachot 73a:4 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>bird offering</b>s <b>in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings because</b> with regard to <b>these,</b> i.e., the birds, <b>their processing,</b> i.e., killing, is executed <b>by hand,</b> by pinching the nape of the neck, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>those,</b> i.e., the animals, <b>their processing,</b> i.e., killing, is executed <b>with a utensil,</b> by slaughtering with a knife. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of <b>meal offerings in exchange for</b> portions of other <b>meal offerings, since the processing of</b> both <b>these and those</b> are carried out <b>by hand.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse states: “And every meal offering mixed with oil…shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10). |
| Leviticus 7:10 | verse states: “Or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have” | Menachot 73a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of a meal offering prepared on <b>a pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal <b>offering</b> prepared in <b>a deep pan, or</b> portions of a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal <b>offering</b> prepared on <b>a pan, since the actions</b> with <b>this pan</b> result in <b>a hard</b> product, <b>and the actions</b> with <b>that</b> deep pan result in <b>a soft</b> product. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of a meal offering prepared on <b>a pan in exchange for</b> the portions of a different meal offering prepared on <b>a pan, or</b> a share of a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a different meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10). |
| Leviticus 7:10 | one as well as another” | Menachot 73a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that they <b>may not receive a share of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., meal offerings, in exchange for a portion of another similar offering, <b>but they may receive a share of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> in exchange for a portion of another similar offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to meal offerings: “Shall all the sons of Aaron have, <b>one as well as another”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>and</b> near it appears the verse: <b>“If</b> he offers it <b>for a thanks offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), from which is derived: <b>Just as one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of the most sacred order, so too, one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a thanks offering. |
| Leviticus 7:10 | unblemished. | Menachot 73a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> further expounds this verse: It states: <b>“One</b> as well as another <b>[<i>ish</i></b> <i>ke’aḥiv</i>],” which teaches that with regard to priests, <b>a man [<i>ish</i>]</b> who is an adult <b>receives a share even</b> if he is <b>blemished, but</b> a priest who is <b>a minor may not receive a share even</b> if he is <b>unblemished.</b> This <i>baraita</i> evidently interprets the verse: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:10), as referring to the prohibition against priests exchanging shares of offerings. If so, how does Ḥizkiyya state that this verse is referring to the priests’ eating of the remainder of the <i>omer</i> offering and the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>? |
| Leviticus 7:11 | thanks offering, about which it is written only “law,” | Menachot 19a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of the <b>thanks offering, about which it is written only “law,”</b> as the verse states: “This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:11), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>thanks offering is different, since it is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to</b> the offering of <b>a nazirite; as it is written</b> in a verse describing the thanks offering: <b>“With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), instead of simply stating: The sacrifice of his thanks offering. <b>And the Master says:</b> The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of <b>the peace offering of</b> the <b>nazirite,</b> to teach that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to both. |
| Leviticus 7:11 | the verse states: “And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings” | Zevachim 120b:2 | The Gemara questions the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about bird</b> offerings? They are notable <b>in that a non-priest is not fit to</b> sacrifice <b>them. Shall you say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> offerings sacrificed on <b>a small</b> private <b>altar, where a non-priest is fit?</b> No, and consequently they <b>should not be disqualified by time.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:11), which equates all peace offerings, <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>time</b> with regard to <b>a small</b> private <b>altar identical to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>time</b> with regard to <b>a great</b> public <b>altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | for a thanks-offering” | Kiddushin 53a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that they <b>may not receive a share of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., meal-offerings, in exchange for a portion of another similar offering, <b>but they may receive a share of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> in exchange for a portion of another similar offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to meal-offerings: “Shall all the sons of Aaron have, <b>one as well as another”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>and near it</b> appears the verse: <b>“If</b> he offers it <b>for a thanks-offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), from which is derived: <b>Just as one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of the most sacred order, so too, one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a thanks-offering. |
| Leviticus 7:12 | “Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering loaves” | Menachot 15a:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that a thanks offering renders its accompanying loaves <i>piggul</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>due to that</b> which <b>Rav Kahana</b> says, this is problematic. <b>As Rav Kahana says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the loaves of a thanks offering are</b> themselves <b>called a thanks offering?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering loaves”</b> (Leviticus 7:12). The juxtaposition of the words “thanks offering” and “loaves” indicates that the loaves are themselves called a thanks offering. |
| Leviticus 7:12 | for a thanks offering” | Menachot 73a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that they <b>may not receive a share of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., meal offerings, in exchange for a portion of another similar offering, <b>but they may receive a share of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> in exchange for a portion of another similar offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to meal offerings: “Shall all the sons of Aaron have, <b>one as well as another”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>and</b> near it appears the verse: <b>“If</b> he offers it <b>for a thanks offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), from which is derived: <b>Just as one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of the most sacred order, so too, one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a thanks offering. |
| Leviticus 7:12 | loaves | Menachot 75a:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, the verse states: “It shall be of <b>fine flour</b> unleavened, <b>mixed</b> with oil.” This <b>teaches that it is mixed</b> while still <b>flour. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that he <b>mixes them, as it is stated:</b> “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). The Rabbis <b>said to him: But is it not with regard to loaves of a thanks offering</b> that <b>it is stated:</b> “Unleavened <b>loaves</b> mixed with oil…and loaves mixed with oil, of fine flour soaked” (Leviticus 7:12), <b>and it is not possible to mix them when they are loaves,</b> but <b>only</b> when they are <b>fine flour?</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | concerning the loaves of the thanks offering, where it is written “ matzot ” | Menachot 76b:3 | <b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> derivation: <b>The reason</b> Rav Huna gives is <b>that it is written</b> in the singular form of <b><i>matzat</i>. But</b> if it were <b>written: <i>Matzot</i>,</b> would this <b>not</b> be the <i>halakha</i>? <b>But</b> what about the verse <b>concerning the loaves of the thanks offering, where it is written “<i>matzot</i>”</b> with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form, in the verse: “Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened loaves mixed with oil” (Leviticus 7:12), <b>and</b> yet <b>Rav Tovi bar Kisna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> In the case of <b>loaves of the thanks offering that were baked as four loaves,</b> such that each of the four varieties of loaves is baked as only one loaf, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> statement of Shmuel <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion of Rav Huna, according to whom four loaves are not fit for the thanks offering. |
| Leviticus 7:12 | courtyard, | Menachot 78b:3 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it means <b>outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> because the verse states with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: “Then he shall sacrifice with [<i>al</i>] the thanks offering unleavened cakes mingled with oil” (Leviticus 7:12). And <b>we require</b> that the thanks offering be slaughtered strictly <b>“with [<i>al</i>]”</b> the accompanying loaves, i.e., with the loaves <b>nearby.</b> If the loaves are outside the wall of the Temple courtyard, they are not considered nearby. |
| Leviticus 7:12 | then he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering | Menachot 79b:12 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the offspring</b> of an animal designated as <b>a thanks offering, or</b> an animal that is <b>its substitute;</b> or in a case where <b>one separated</b> an animal as <b>a thanks offering and it was lost and he separated another in its stead,</b> and the first animal was then found, in all three cases, the second animal, i.e., the offspring, the substitute, or the replacement, is sacrificed, but it <b>does not require</b> the bringing of accompanying <b>loaves.</b> This is <b>as it is stated:</b> “If he sacrifices it for a thanks offering, <b>then he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering</b> unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour poached” (Leviticus 7:12). The verse indicates that <b>the</b> initial <b>thanks offering requires loaves, but neither its offspring, nor its replacement, nor its substitute requires loaves.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | “Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering loaves” | Menachot 80b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Kahana,</b> that is difficult. <b>As Rav Kahana said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the loaves of a thanks offering are</b> themselves <b>called a thanks offering?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering loaves”</b> (Leviticus 7:12). The juxtaposition of the words “thanks offering” and “loaves” indicates that the loaves are themselves called a thanks offering. Therefore, one who separated money for a thanks offering may use that money for the loaves as well. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>If that is so, the opposite</b> should <b>also</b> be the <i>halakha</i>, i.e., the thanks offering is called loaves, and it should therefore be permitted to use the money remaining from the loaves for the thanks offering. The Gemara rejects this: <b>The loaves are called a thanks offering,</b> but <b>the thanks offering is not called loaves.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | is outside the wall, the bread has not become sanctified, | Pesachim 63b:2 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who slaughters a thanks-offering inside</b> the Temple courtyard while <b>its bread,</b> namely the forty loaves that are brought together with the offering, <b>is outside the wall, the bread has not become sanctified,</b> as the verse states: “And he shall offer with the thanks-offering unleavened cakes.” (Leviticus 7:12). |
| Leviticus 7:12 | “If [ im ] he offer it for a thanksgiving” | Temurah 18a:14 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Ami: If that is so,</b> then with regard to the verse: <b>“If [<i>im</i>] he offer it for a thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), <b>so too</b> one should interpret it to mean <b>that</b> one may sacrifice <b>the mother [<i>em</i>] but not the offspring</b> as a thanks offering. <b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Eliezer <b>indeed</b> holds that the offspring of a thanks offering is not sacrificed as a thanks offering, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> the following <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the offspring</b> of a thanks offering <b>and its substitute and its replacement,</b> if the original animal was lost and then found again, rendering both animals suitable for an offering: <b>From where</b> is it derived that all these are sacrificed as thanks offerings? <b>The verse states: “If for a thanksgiving,”</b> which indicates that they may be offered as a thanks offering <b>in any case.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | As the Sages taught | Temurah 18b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived, that the offspring and substitute of a thanks offering do not require the accompanying loaves? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: “If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 7:12). <b>What</b> does the term <b>“offer it [<i>yakrivenu</i>]”</b> serve to <b>say?</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | fine flour cooked | Zevachim 50a:12 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether <b>a matter derived via a verbal analogy</b> can <b>teach</b> its <i>halakha</i> to another matter <b>via</b> another <b>verbal analogy? Rami bar Ḥama says: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the types of bread that accompany a thanks offering: “If he sacrifices it for a thanks offering, then he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering unleavened loaves mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and loaves mingled with oil, of <b>fine flour cooked</b> with oil” (Leviticus 7:12). <b>We have derived</b> from here <b>that</b> the <b>poached</b> breads accompanying the thanks offering <b>come from fine flour.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:12 | The verse states: “Loaves | Zevachim 50a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <b>loaves</b> accompanying a thanks offering are also prepared with fine flour? <b>The verse states: “Loaves</b> mingled with oil, of fine flour cooked with oil” (Leviticus 7:12), and it also states in the same verse: “Unleavened <b>loaves</b> mingled with oil.” <b>From where</b> is it derived that the unleavened <b>wafers</b> accompanying a thanks offering are also prepared with fine flour? <b>The verse states: “Unleavened</b> cakes mingled with oil” (Leviticus 7:12), and the verse also states: <b>“Unleavened</b> wafers spread with oil.” The <i>baraita</i> derives via a verbal analogy that the unleavened loaves mingled with oil are prepared with fine flour, and then teaches the <i>halakha</i> concerning unleavened wafers using a verbal analogy from the <i>halakha</i> of unleavened loaves. |
| Leviticus 7:13 | “With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” | Menachot 19a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of the <b>thanks offering, about which it is written only “law,”</b> as the verse states: “This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:11), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>thanks offering is different, since it is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to</b> the offering of <b>a nazirite; as it is written</b> in a verse describing the thanks offering: <b>“With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), instead of simply stating: The sacrifice of his thanks offering. <b>And the Master says:</b> The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of <b>the peace offering of</b> the <b>nazirite,</b> to teach that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to both. |
| Leviticus 7:13 | “With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” | Menachot 27a:19 | With regard to the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>since</b> the thanks offering <b>is juxtaposed to</b> the offerings of <b>a nazirite, as it is written</b> with regard to the thanks offering: <b>“With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:13). <b>And the Master said:</b> The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of <b>the peace offering of a nazirite,</b> and it has already been demonstrated that with regard to the loaves that accompany the offerings of a nazirite, each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others. |
| Leviticus 7:13 | thanks offering is different, as the Merciful One called it a peace offering, | Menachot 46a:16 | The Gemara answers: The <b>thanks offering is different, as the Merciful One called it a peace offering,</b> as the verse states: “The sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” (Leviticus 7:13). Consequently, <b>just as a peace offering is sacrificed without loaves, so too a thanks offering</b> can be <b>sacrificed without loaves.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:13 | as the Master says: | Menachot 76a:19 | That ten loaves accompany the guilt offering of <b>naziriteship</b> is derived from a verse, <b>as the Master says:</b> The verse describing the thanks offering states: “With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” (Leviticus 7:13). The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of the <b>peace offering of the nazirite.</b> Just as each of the four varieties of loaves accompanying the thanks offering are brought in units of ten loaves, so too, the peace offering of the nazirite comprises ten loaves. |
| Leviticus 7:13 | “Bread” | Menachot 77b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We have learned with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>that its</b> measure is <b>one</b> out <b>of</b> every <b>ten. But I do not know</b> from this verbal analogy <b>from how much</b> flour each leavened <b>loaf</b> is to be prepared. <b>I</b> therefore <b>derive</b> this from a verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> in the passage concerning the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“Bread”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there, with regard to the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat: <b>“Bread”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the two loaves, one prepares the loaves with <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf, so too here,</b> with regard to the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, one prepares the loaves with <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:13 | “With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice | Menachot 78b:11 | The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to the loaves accompanying the thanks offering: <b>“With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice</b> of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:13). This <b>teaches that the loaves are not consecrated unless the surface</b> of the loaves <b>formed a crust in the oven,</b> as only then can they be considered “cakes of leavened bread.” The phrase <b>“he shall present his offering with the sacrifice” teaches that the loaves are consecrated only upon the slaughtering of the offering.</b> The phrase <b>“the sacrifice</b> of his peace offerings <b>for thanks” teaches that if one slaughtered</b> the offering <b>not for its sake, the loaves were not consecrated.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:13 | written | Pesachim 37a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is half-baked <i>matza</i>? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> This refers to <b>any</b> <i>matza</i> <b>that</b> is sufficiently baked so that <b>when</b> it is <b>broken no strands</b> of dough <b>emerge from its sides. Rava said: And likewise the loaves of the thanks-offering</b> may be used if they have been baked to this extent. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, as <b>here,</b> with regard to <i>matza</i>, <b>“bread” is written, and there,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks-offering, <b>“bread” is</b> also <b>written</b> (Leviticus 7:13). Since both loaves are called bread, it is obvious that the same criteria should apply to both cases. |
| Leviticus 7:13 | so is the guilt-offering” | Yevamot 7b:1 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “As the sin-offering</b>…<b>so is the guilt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), to teach that <b>just as the sin-offering requires placement of the blood and sacrificial parts on the altar, so too, the</b> leper’s <b>guilt-offering requires placement of the blood and sacrificial parts on the altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:13 | the verse states: “With cakes of leavened bread” | Zevachim 57b:5 | The Gemara continues: The ten loaves accompanying a thanks offering must each be a tenth of an ephah, and this has been derived from two sources: A juxtaposition with the offering of <i>Shavuot</i> and another principle, which is that which the verse states concerning the thanks offering, that there must be ten leavened loaves. <b>And we have learned</b> that <b>ten</b>-tenths of an ephah is required <b>for</b> the ten loaves of <b>leavened bread. From where</b> is it derived that <b>ten</b>-tenths of an ephah are required <b>for</b> the <b><i>matza</i></b> which also accompanies a thanks offering? After stating that thirty <i>matzot</i> accompany a thanks offering, <b>the verse states: “With cakes of leavened bread”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), to juxtapose the <i>matza</i> with the leavened bread. This teaches that one must <b>bring <i>matza</i></b> of an amount <b>corresponding to</b> the <b>leavened bread.</b> In any event, this derivation can be employed according to the one who says that a matter derived via a juxtaposition and another principle is not a juxtaposition. |
| Leviticus 7:14 | “Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering” | Menachot 3b:16 | The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the <b>offering itself is called <i>shelamim</i>, as it is written: “Who sacrifices the blood of the peace offering [<i>shelamim</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and it is also written: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14). <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>is a meal offering itself called mixed?</b> It <b>is written: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), indicating that there is a meal offering that <b>is called: Mixed with oil,</b> but <b>it is not simply called: Mixed.</b> One’s intent to sacrifice a dry meal offering for the sake of mixing is therefore not a reference to the offering itself. |
| Leviticus 7:14 | the loaves of the thanks offering, it is written explicitly of them | Menachot 76a:18 | § The mishna teaches that Rabbi Meir says: They all come as twelve loaves <b>except for</b> the <b>loaves</b> of the <b>thanks offering and</b> the loaves that accompany the guilt offering of <b>naziriteship, which come</b> as <b>ten each.</b> The Gemara explains the exceptions: With regard to <b>the loaves of the thanks offering, it is written explicitly of them</b> that these loaves are brought in units of ten, based on a verbal analogy: With regard to the thanks offering, the verse states: “And of it he shall present one out of each offering for a gift [<i>teruma</i>] to the Lord” (Leviticus 7:14), and with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe it is stated: “You shall set apart of it a gift [<i>teruma</i>] for the Lord, a tithe of the tithe” (Numbers 18:26). Just as the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe consists of one portion of ten, so too, the loaves of the thanks offering are brought in units of ten (see 77b). |
| Leviticus 7:14 | as it is stated: “And he shall present from it one of each offering as a teruma unto the Lord; | Menachot 77b:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From all</b> of the four types of loaves accompanying the thanks offering, <b>one takes one</b> loaf <b>from</b> each set of <b>ten as <i>teruma</i>,</b> to be given to a priest, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall present from it one of each offering as a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord;</b> to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings against the altar it shall be given” (Leviticus 7:14). The verse is analyzed: <b>“One”</b> indicates <b>that one should not take a sliced</b> loaf; <b>“of each offering”</b> indicates <b>that all the offerings should be equal,</b> i.e., <b>that one should not take</b> a loaf <b>from</b> one type of <b>offering for another</b> type; <b>“to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings against the altar it shall be given,” and the rest</b> of the loaves are <b>eaten by the owner.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:14 | of which it is stated: “From it a teruma unto the Lord” | Menachot 77b:21 | The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>from <i>teruma</i> of <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of dough given to the priest, as the verse refers to it as a <i>teruma</i> (see Numbers 15:19–20). That measure is one in twenty-four. The Gemara responds: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b>one derives a matter,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>of which it is stated: “From it a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 7:14), <b>from a matter,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>of which it is stated:</b> “From it <b>a <i>teruma</i> for the Lord”</b> (Numbers 18:26). This serves <b>to exclude <i>teruma</i> of <i>ḥalla</i>, of which it is not stated: From it a <i>teruma</i> for the Lord.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:14 | one | Menachot 78b:14 | The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift unto the Lord” (Leviticus 7:14), this indicates <b>that one may not take sliced</b> bread for the thanks offering, <b>and this</b> half-done bread <b>is considered like one that is sliced,</b> as it will break apart upon being lifted, and it should consequently be disqualified for the bread of the thanks offering, therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that once it is baked to that point, it is considered as one loaf and it is valid for the thanks offering. |
| Leviticus 7:14 | one out of each offering | Nedarim 12b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But he is required to take <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., designate one loaf of each type to be given to the priests. <b>And if you would say that he takes one</b> loaf of <b>bread</b> of the four as <i>teruma</i> <b>for all</b> the others, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 77b) with regard to the verse “And of it he shall present <b>one out of each offering</b> for a gift to the Lord; it shall be the priest’s” (Leviticus 7:14), that it indicates <b>that he should not take from one offering,</b> i.e., one type of loaf, <b>for another? And if you would say that he takes a slice from each one</b> of the four loaves and gives them to the priest, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in that mishna that the word <b>one</b> in the verse indicates <b>that he may not take a slice</b> but rather a complete loaf? |
| Leviticus 7:14 | one | Niddah 6b:8 | The Gemara continues its answer by further elucidating the statement of Rav Tovi bar Rav Ketina. And we asked with regard to this opinion: <b>But he is required to separate <i>teruma</i> from it,</b> i.e., to designate one loaf from each type that is given to the priests. <b>And if you would say that he separates a slice from each one</b> of the four loaves and gives them to the priest, this cannot be the case, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift to the Lord; it shall be the priest’s” (Leviticus 7:14). The word “one” indicates <b>that he may not take a slice,</b> but rather he takes a complete loaf. The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>we</b> must <b>say</b> that he <b>separated</b> dough for the <i>teruma</i> loaves <b>during its kneading. Here too, in</b> the incident involving Rabban Gamliel’s maidservant, she <b>separated</b> the dough <b>during its kneading.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:14 | one out of each offering | Pesachim 37b:1 | <b>one out of each offering</b> for a gift to the Lord; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace-offerings” (Leviticus 7:14), and the word <b>“one”</b> indicates that it must be a whole loaf, i.e., <b>that</b> one should <b>not take a broken</b> piece, <b>and here</b> the bread has not been properly baked, it might therefore have been thought that <b>it is considered as though it were broken.</b> Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is nevertheless classified as bread. |
| Leviticus 7:14 | “It shall be the priest’s that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings | Zevachim 102b:20 | The pure priest responded: The verse <b>states</b> with regard to the peace offering: <b>“It shall be the priest’s that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings</b> against the altar” (Leviticus 7:14). If you wish to partake of a peace offering, <b>come sprinkle</b> its blood <b>and partake</b> of it. Since you cannot perform this service, having immersed only today, you cannot receive a share of its meat either. |
| Leviticus 7:14 | Rather, the verse states: “Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering” | Zevachim 4a:11 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14), indicating <b>that</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:14 | “Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering” | Zevachim 4a:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> in other verses: <b>“Who offers the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14), <b>and</b> the term: <b>A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>], is not written,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> in this verse, the term: <b>“A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>]</b> of peace offerings,” <b>is written, learn from it that</b> the <b>slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>] must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:15 | until dawn. | Berakhot 2a:5 | Rabban Gamliel cites several cases in support of his claim, such as <b>the burning of fats and limbs</b> on the altar. Due to the quantity of offerings each day, the priests were often unable to complete the burning of all of the fats and limbs, so they continued to be burned into the night, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain upon the pyre on the altar all night until morning, while the fire on the altar burns it” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings <b>that are eaten for one day</b> and night; although the Sages state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten <b>until dawn.</b> This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If so, why did the Sages say</b> that they may be eaten only <b>until midnight?</b> This is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression,</b> as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed. |
| Leviticus 7:15 | a peace offering. | Menachot 81b:18 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira, and he was sitting and saying:</b> The mishna <b>taught only</b> that the loaves may not be brought <b>from second-tithe wheat</b> itself, <b>but he may bring</b> the loaves <b>from wheat purchased from second-tithe money.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: My teacher,</b> do <b>you say so? I say</b> that <b>he may not bring</b> the loaves <b>even from wheat purchased from second-tithe money. And I will say my reasoning and I will say your reasoning. I will say your reasoning</b> first: <b>From where do you derive</b> that the loaves of <b>a thanks offering</b> may be brought from wheat purchased with second-tithe money? You derive it from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a peace offering.</b> A thanks offering is a type of peace offering, as the verse states: “And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:15), and a peace offering may be brought from second-tithe money. |
| Leviticus 7:15 | and one verse states: “He shall not leave any of it until the morning” | Zevachim 36a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who deems the offering unfit if there was intent to leave it over until the next day or to take it out of its designated area? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> There are <b>two verses</b> that <b>are written with regard to <i>notar</i>. One verse states: “You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning,</b> and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10), <b>and one verse states: “He shall not leave any of it until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If</b> the additional verse <b>is not</b> necessary for <b>the matter of</b> the prohibition <b>against leaving</b> it overnight, which is already mentioned by the first verse, <b>apply it to the matter of intent of leaving</b> it overnight, which would therefore be prohibited as well. |
| Leviticus 7:15 | that which is taught | Zevachim 36a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, does this verse come to</b> teach <b>this</b> idea? <b>This</b> verse is <b>necessary for him to</b> derive <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). From the words: <b>“And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving,” we learned with regard to a thanks offering that it is eaten for a day and a night.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:15 | “And the meat of the sacrifice [ zevaḥ ] of his thanksgiving peace offering | Zevachim 4a:18 | <b>Rav Pinḥas, son of Rav Ami, says: The verse states</b> with regard to a thanks offering: <b>“And the meat of the sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of his thanksgiving peace offering</b> shall be eaten on the day of his offering” (Leviticus 7:15), apparently indicating <b>that</b> its <b>slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>] must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a thanks offering.</b> And <b>if</b> this language <b>is not</b> needed <b>for the matter of deviation</b> with regard to the type of <b>offering,</b> and in fact it is not, <b>as we</b> already <b>derived</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from there,</b> i.e., the verse cited concerning peace offerings, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b> It is thereby derived that an offering must be slaughtered for the sake of its owner. |
| Leviticus 7:16 | is a vow or a free-will offering, | Pesachim 71b:2 | There is still room to say: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> eaten <b>only</b> until <b>the first morning, and how do I establish</b> what the Torah says, that <b>a Festival peace-offering may be eaten for two days and one night?</b> This applies to Festival peace-offerings <b>other than this</b> one. The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>When it says</b> with regard to a peace-offering: “But <b>if</b> the sacrifice of his offering <b>is a vow or a free-will offering,</b> it shall be eaten on the same day that he sacrifices his offering; and on the morrow also, the remainder of it shall be eaten” (Leviticus 7:16), <b>it teaches that</b> any peace-offering, whether a vow or a free-will offering, or an obligation, including <b>the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth, is eaten for two days and one night.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:16 | a vow or a gift-offering” | Rosh Hashanah5b:3 | The Gemara now analyzes the words of Deuteronomy 23:22 cited above and looks at each component. <b>It is stated here: “Vow,” and it is stated elsewhere: “But if</b> the sacrifice of his offering be <b>a vow or a gift-offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:16). <b>Just as there a gift-offering is</b> together <b>with</b> the vow and is governed by the same <i>halakha</i>, <b>so too, here, a gift-offering is</b> together with the vow and is governed by the same <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:16 | it shall be eaten on the day that he sacrifices his offering [ zivḥo ], | Zevachim 56a:13 | § <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the blood</b> of offerings <b>becomes disqualified at sunset</b> and can no longer be presented on the altar? This is <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a gift offering, <b>it shall be eaten on the day that he sacrifices his offering [<i>zivḥo</i>],</b> and on the morrow” (Leviticus 7:16). This means that <b>on the day that you slaughter [<i>zove’aḥ</i>]</b> the offering <b>you sacrifice</b> it on the altar and present its blood. But <b>on the day that you do not slaughter</b> the offering <b>you may not sacrifice</b> it and present its blood. |
| Leviticus 7:17 | the verse states: “And if any remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day, it shall be burnt with fire” | Pesachim 3a:6 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And if any remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day, it shall be burnt with fire”</b> (Leviticus 7:17), meaning: <b>You</b> must <b>burn it during the day, and you do not burn it at night.</b> With regard to the meaning of <i>or</i>, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states:</b> One might have thought that <b>it may be eaten</b> on <b><i>or</i> of the third</b> day, <b>apparently <i>or</i> is evening.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that <i>or</i> is evening. |
| Leviticus 7:17 | vav and heh | Yevamot 72b:6 | <b>And even</b> the Sage <b>who does not expound</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i>,</b> meaning “and,” as superfluous, <b>expounds</b> the letters <b><i>vav</i> and <i>heh</i></b> when they come together and understands them as alluding to cases not explicitly mentioned in the biblical text. Regarding <i>notar</i> the verse states: “And that which remains [<i>vehanotar</i>] of the flesh of the offering on the third day shall be burnt with fire” (Leviticus 7:17), where the letters <i>vav</i> and <i>heh</i> teach that the obligation to burn <i>notar</i> during the day extends beyond the third day itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>was silent,</b> as he had no response. |
| Leviticus 7:17 | on the third day, it shall be burned with fire” | Zevachim 56b:9 | To counter this logic, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if any remains of the flesh of the sacrifice <b>on the third day, it shall be burned with fire”</b> (Leviticus 7:17), meaning: <b>You</b> must <b>burn it during the day, but you may not burn it during the night.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be at all eaten [ he’akhol ye’akhel ] | Chullin 81b:2 | <b>And Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>Consumption by the altar is considered consumption. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]: <b>“And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be at all eaten [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>]</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “And the soul that eats it shall bear his iniquity” | Keritot 5a:11 | The Gemara explains that this is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Zavda bar Levi teaches: It is stated there,</b> with regard to meat of an offering left over after the appointed time for its consumption [<i>notar</i>]: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is stated here,</b> with regard to intent to consume an offering after its appointed time: <b>“And the soul that eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). <b>Just as there</b> the punishment for eating <i>notar</i> is <b><i>karet</i>, so too here,</b> the punishment for eating <i>piggul</i> is <b><i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” | Menachot 13b:17 | Rav Huna elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Disqualifying <b>intent is no stronger than an incident of ritual impurity,</b> and <b>if one limb</b> of an offering <b>became impure, did the entire</b> offering then <b>become impure?</b> Accordingly, one limb can be rendered <i>piggul</i> without the other. <b>And if you wish, cite a verse</b> that addresses <i>piggul</i>: <b>“And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). The verse indicates that one who eats specifically <b>“of it,”</b> i.e., from one part, shall bear his iniquity, <b>and not</b> one who eats <b>from the other</b> part of the offering. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | be accepted” | Menachot 16b:3 | The Gemara provides the source for this claim. <b>As the Master said</b> that the verse states with regard to <i>piggul</i>: <b>“It shall</b> not <b>be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), which indicates that <b>the acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering is <b>like the acceptance of a valid</b> offering, of which the verse states: “It shall be accepted” (Leviticus 22:27), and <b>just as</b> there is no <b>acceptance of a valid</b> offering <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed, so too</b> there is no lack of <b>acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering, i.e., it is not rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed.</b> That is to say, in the absence of one of its permitting factors it does not become <i>piggul</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at all consumed [ he’akhol ye’akhel ]” | Menachot 17a:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the intention to consume, beyond its designated time, an item that is not usually consumed renders the meal offering unfit? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to consuming an offering after its designated time: <b>“And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at all consumed [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), repeating for emphasis the term for consumption. He derives from the repeated term that <b>the verse is speaking of two</b> types of <b>consumption: One</b> is <b>the consumption</b> of the offering <b>by a person,</b> e.g., by the priests or the owner of the offering, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is the consumption</b> of the sacrificial portions <b>by</b> their being burned on the <b>altar.</b> This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> one’s improper <b>intention with regard to the consumption of a person</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>so too,</b> one’s improper <b>intention with regard to the consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | is already stated: “It shall not be credited | Menachot 25a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items,</b> which the children of Israel shall hallow, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). The Sages expounded: <b>But which sin does he bear? If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated: “It shall not be credited</b> to him” (Leviticus 7:18). <b>If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | it will not be imputed to him” | Nedarim 36a:5 | The Sages <b>say</b> in response: It <b>is different with regard to <i>piggul</i>, as</b> in its regard <b>the verse states</b> and emphasizes: “He who offered it, <b>it will not be imputed to him”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). This implies that it is <i>piggul</i> <b>in any case,</b> e.g., even if one’s actions cause the offering to be <i>piggul</i> without the consent of the owner. Therefore, there is no proof with regard to the nature of the agency of the priest. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | neither shall it be credited | Pesachim 16b:8 | <b>And</b> the Sages expounded: <b>Which sin does it bear? If</b> you say it atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat the offering after the permitted time, <b>it is already stated:</b> “And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <i>piggul</i>; <b>it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:7). <b>If</b> you say it atones for <b><i>notar</i>,</b> i.e., meat of an offering left after the time that one was permitted to eat it, <b>it is already stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “iniquity” | Pesachim 73b:13 | The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>From where</b> is this known to be correct? <b>Perhaps</b> it requires uprooting and the disqualification is inherent. And the fact that he requires decay of form <b>is because he agrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabba bar Avuh, who said</b> that <b>even <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by improper intent, which is considered an inherent disqualification, <b>also requires decay of form, for he derived</b> this requirement by way of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18) stated in relation to an offering disqualified by improper intent and the word <b>“iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 19:7) stated <b>with regard to leftover</b> sacrificial meat. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “iniquity.” | Pesachim 82b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy from the parallel words <b>“iniquity”</b> and <b>“iniquity.”</b> With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It remains rejected [<i>piggul</i>]; and the soul that eats it shall bear its iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to <b>leftover</b> sacrificial meat, the verse states: “And whatever is leftover…shall be burned in fire…and each of those who eat it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 19:6–8). Just as leftover sacrificial meat is burned after it has been left over to the next day, so too, <i>piggul</i> is burned only after it has been left over to the next day and its form has decayed. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | it, | Rosh Hashanah6a:1 | as this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> that <b>which ben Azzai</b> said, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai says:</b> The verse states: “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers <b>it,</b> it shall be <i>piggul</i>” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 7:18 | notar , as it is written with regard to piggul : “And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” | Temurah 3a:7 | <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the gentiles’ exemption from <b><i>piggul</i></b> by verbal analogy <b>between</b> the word <b>“iniquity”</b> used in the context of <i>piggul</i> and the word <b>“iniquity”</b> used in the context of <b><i>notar</i>, as it is written with regard to <i>piggul</i>: “And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), <b>and it is written with regard to <i>notar</i>: “But everyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8). <b>And</b> based on these two verbal analogies, one concludes that with regard to <b>all of them,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and ritually impure offerings, the prohibition against consumption applies only to offerings of <b>the children of Israel, but not</b> to those of <b>gentiles.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | neither shall it be credited | Yoma 7a:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection.</b> It is stated: <b>“And Aaron will gain forgiveness for the sin committed in the sacred things</b> that the children of Israel shall hallow in all their sacred gifts, and it shall be always upon his forehead that they may be accepted favorably before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). <b>And for which sin does</b> the frontplate <b>gain forgiveness? If</b> it is for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat it after the permitted time, <b>it has already been stated:</b> “And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <i>piggul</i>; <b>it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:7). There is no acceptance of an offering that became <i>piggul</i>. <b>And if it is</b> for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> meat of an offering left after the permitted time for eating it passed, <b>it has already been stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 7:18 | The verse states: “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, | Zevachim 13a:19 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>intent</b> to consume an offering after its designated time <b>is effective</b> to render the offering <i>piggul</i> <b>only</b> when one has that intent <b>during sprinkling. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include slaughter and collection</b> of the blood in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted,</b> neither shall it be imputed to the one who offers it; it shall be an abhorred thing [<i>piggul</i> ]” (Leviticus 7:18). As derived on 29a, the verse is referring to performance of the sacrificial rites with intent to consume the offering after its designated time. The phrase “is at all eaten” teaches that <b>the verse speaks of matters that lead to consumption,</b> i.e., those sacrificial rites that enable consumption of the offering, including slaughter of the animal and collecting the blood. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | the verse states: “On the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to the one who offers it” | Zevachim 13a:21 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “On the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to the one who offers it”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). The phrase “the one who offers it” indicates the sprinkling of the blood. <b>Sprinkling was included</b> in the general category of rites that enable consumption. <b>And for what</b> purpose <b>was it singled out? To compare</b> other <i>halakhot</i> <b>to it,</b> i.e., <b>to say to you: Just as sprinkling is unique, as it is a rite and</b> if not performed <b>it prevents atonement, so too, any rite</b> that <b>prevents atonement</b> if not performed is included in the <i>halakha</i> of <i>piggul</i>. <b>Pouring</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the blood <b>and burning</b> the <b>sacrificial portions are</b> therefore <b>excluded, as they do not prevent atonement</b> if not performed. Evidently, intent of <i>piggul</i> applies to the collection of the blood, contrary to Rava’s resolution of the contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | is at all eaten [ he’akhol ye’akhel ] | Zevachim 13b:3 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>only</b> prohibited <b>intent with regard to consumption of the meat is effective</b> to render the offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> the <b>pouring of</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the blood <b>and</b> the <b>burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions? The verse states: “And if</b> any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings <b>is at all eaten [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i> ]</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18). It is derived from the repeated verb that <b>the verse speaks of two</b> types of <b>consumption: One is consumption</b> of the meat <b>by man,</b> i.e., by the priests or the owner of the offering, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is consumption</b> of the blood and the sacrificial portions <b>on the altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | from anything but a peace offering? | Zevachim 13b:6 | <b>Ilfa heard</b> this statement and <b>said it before Rav Padda.</b> Rav Padda <b>said</b> in response: <b>Did we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>piggul</i></b> with regard to all offerings <b>from anything but a peace offering?</b> The source for the <i>halakha</i> of <i>piggul</i> is the verse stated with regard to peace offerings (Leviticus 7:18). Therefore, <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a peace offering,</b> prohibited intent while <b>dipping</b> one’s <b>finger</b> in the blood to sprinkle it on the altar <b>does not render it <i>piggul</i>,</b> as there is no requirement to sprinkle the blood of a peace offering with one’s finger rather than the containing vessel, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> prohibited intent while <b>dipping</b> one’s <b>finger</b> in the blood <b>does not render it <i>piggul</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | neither shall it be credited | Zevachim 23b:1 | <b>If</b> the verse means that he bears <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>, it is already stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offers it” (Leviticus 7:18). <b>If</b> he bears <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>, it is already stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | it shall be piggul ” | Zevachim 27a:5 | <b>Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: From where do you</b> derive <b>this?</b> Mar Zutra replied: I derive it from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to he who offers it, <b>it shall be <i>piggul</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). The verse indicates that only an offering <b>whose</b> intent of <b><i>piggul</i></b> alone <b>caused it</b> to be disqualified is considered <i>piggul</i>. <b>Excluded is this</b> case, <b>whose</b> intent of <b><i>piggul</i></b> alone <b>did not cause it</b> to be disqualified; <b>rather, the prohibition of something else,</b> i.e., the intent to sprinkle the blood in an improper location, <b>caused it</b> to be disqualified. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | Rabba said: | Zevachim 28a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these verses? <b>Rabba said:</b> Shmuel is referring to two phrases from the verse: “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to he who offers it; it shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18). The Sages taught that this verse is referring not to offerings actually eaten on the third day, but to one who performs one of the sacrificial rites with intent to eat the offering beyond its designated time. Now, when the verse states: “And if any of the flesh…be at all eaten on the <b>third</b> day,” <b>this is</b> referring to intent to consume the meat <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | since it is already stated: “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day | Zevachim 28a:19 | <b>Rather, Abaye said: When Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi came,</b> he said that <b>Rav says:</b> Shmuel was actually referring to two separate verses. And he <b>relied on that which the <i>tanna</i> taught:</b> The verse is seemingly redundant <b>when it states:</b> “And if it be eaten at all on the <b>third</b> day, it is <i>piggul</i>; it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 19:7), <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 19:2), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated: “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day</b>…it shall be <i>piggul</i>” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 7:18 | are derived from the long verse. As it is written: | Zevachim 28b:10 | <b>Rather, Rava says:</b> One must accept the original interpretation of Shmuel’s statement, that <b>all of</b> these <i>halakhot</i> with regard to intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time or outside its designated area <b>are derived from the long verse. As it is written:</b> “If any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to he who offers it; it shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18). When the verse states: <b>“Be at all eaten [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>],”</b> using a doubled verb, <b>the verse speaks of</b> intent with regard to <b>two consumptions, one consumption by a person, and one consumption by</b> the <b>altar,</b> i.e., burning the offering. Improper intent with regard to either of these acts renders the offering <i>piggul</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | that the long verse | Zevachim 28b:7 | The Gemara returns to the initial assumption that the statement of Shmuel is referring to two verses: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to conclude <b>that the long verse</b> (Leviticus 7:18) is referring <b>to</b> intent to consume the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and</b> that the verse that mentions the <b>third</b> day (Leviticus 19:7) <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy,”</b> is referring to intent to consume it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area? I</b> might just as well <b>reverse</b> the two. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | in: “It shall not be accepted” | Zevachim 29a:11 | <b>Ben Azzai says: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “It”?</b> It is necessary <b>because</b> elsewhere <b>it is stated:</b> “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, <b>you shall not delay paying it;</b> for the Lord your God will require it from you, and it will be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> one who <b>is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow</b> is included <b>in: “It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It,”</b> to indicate that <b>it,</b> an offering rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted,” but</b> the animal of <b>one who is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b> |
| Leviticus 7:18 | Aḥerim say: | Zevachim 29a:12 | <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> One can conclude that the verse (Leviticus 7:18) is referring to improper intention rather than improper consumption from the phrase <b>“neither shall it be credited [<i>yeḥashev</i>],”</b> which indicates that the offering <b>is disqualified by</b> improper <b>intention [<i>maḥashava</i>], and it is not disqualified</b> by consumption <b>on the third</b> day. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | and: “It shall not be accepted” | Zevachim 29a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And ben Azzai,</b> who interprets the term “it” as excluding vows that were fulfilled late, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>that the verse is speaking of</b> the <b>offering and not of</b> the <b>priest?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>he derives it from</b> the statement <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i></b> that the verse rules out disqualification on the third day itself. This would be necessary only if the verse is referring to the offering and not the priest. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “They shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), <b>and: “It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), it is evident that the verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>an offering,</b> which may be accepted or may not be accepted. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | be at all eaten | Zevachim 29a:6 | The Gemara asks: Why not <b>let me derive</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>from the first verse:</b> “And <b>if</b> any of the flesh of his peace offerings <b>be at all eaten</b> on the third day” (Leviticus 7:18), <b>since the Merciful One expresses</b> that verse as well <b>with the term “third”?</b> Since Rava derives the disqualification of intent to consume an offering outside its designated area from this verse, why not let him derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verse as well? |
| Leviticus 7:18 | from there | Zevachim 29a:7 | <b>Rav Ashi said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Mattana,</b> and <b>he said to me: If</b> one were to derive this <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there</b> (Leviticus 7:18), <b>I would say:</b> The term <b>“third”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> and the term <b>“<i>piggul</i>”</b> is <b>a generalization, and</b> whenever a detail is followed by a generalization, <b>the generalization becomes an addition to the detail, and</b> consequently, all <b>other areas are included</b> as well. The additional verse <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> includes only those areas that are outside in three ways. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten | Zevachim 29a:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18): <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Bend your ear to hear</b> the true meaning of the verse: <b>The verse is speaking of one who intends to partake of his offering on the third day. Or</b> perhaps it is referring <b>only to</b> one <b>who</b> actually <b>partakes of his offering on the third day,</b> per the straightforward meaning of the verse? But that cannot be; would <b>you say</b> that <b>after</b> the offering <b>is fit</b> for the first two days, <b>it should then be disqualified</b> retroactively by being eaten on the third day? |
| Leviticus 7:18 | “And if any be at all eaten | Zevachim 44a:15 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <i>piggul</i> status applies to a firstborn offering is derived through the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail and a generalization, <b>from</b> the following verse: <b>“And if any be at all eaten</b> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18). The terms: “And if any” and “be at all eaten” are generalizations, while the words: “The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering” constitute a detail. According to the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail and a generalization, in such a case one includes any item that is similar to the detail, and therefore one includes the firstborn offering. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | piggul . | Zevachim 44a:4 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that has permitting factors, either for</b> consumption by <b>a person or for</b> burning on <b>the altar, one is liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> The Gemara cites a verse and a related <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: “And if any be at all eaten of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who sacrifices it; it shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18). The <i>baraita</i> first demonstrates that the <i>halakha</i> of <i>piggul</i> applies not only to a peace offering, with regard to which it is stated in the Torah, but to all offerings. |
| Leviticus 7:18 | notar . | Zevachim 44a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> clarifies this derivation: The <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i></b> applies to all these offerings is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy of <b>profanation</b> in the context of <i>notar</i>: “And if anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned in fire…and anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred item of the Lord” (Leviticus 19:6–8), and <b>profanation</b> stated in the verse discussing <b>ritual impurity:</b> “And that they do not profane My holy name.” <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b><i>piggul</i></b> applies to all these offerings is subsequently <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy of <b>“iniquity”</b> in the context of <i>piggul</i> and <b>“iniquity”</b> stated in the verse discussing <b><i>notar</i>.</b> With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to <i>notar</i>, it is stated in the aforementioned verse: “And anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity.” |
| Leviticus 7:18 | notar . | Zevachim 45a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> further taught: <b>And one is not liable for</b> eating the offerings of gentiles <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> eating the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains that the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>piggul</i> is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“iniquity”</b> stated with regard to <i>piggul</i> and the word <b>“iniquity”</b> stated with regard to <b><i>notar</i>.</b> With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to leftover sacrificial meat the verse states: “Therefore anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 19:8). |
| Leviticus 7:18 | piggul . | Zevachim 45b:14 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>notar</i> <b>be derived</b> through a verbal analogy between <b>“iniquity”</b> stated in the context of <i>notar</i> and <b>“iniquity”</b> stated in the context of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to leftover sacrificial meat the verse states: “Therefore anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 19:8). If so, the <i>halakha</i> of <i>notar</i> should be similar to that of <i>piggul</i>, for which one is liable only for an item that has a permitting factor. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | As it is written: “And the meat that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten” | Chagigah 24a:6 | The above <i>baraita</i> taught that there is a <b>third</b> degree of impurity <b>for sacrificial</b> food <b>from the Torah.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this derived? <b>As it is written: “And the meat that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). <b>Is it not</b> so that <b>we are not dealing</b> in that verse with meat that touches any “impure thing” at all, even <b>if it touched</b> something that is of the <b>second</b> degree of ritual impurity, which is also called an “impure thing”? <b>And</b> yet <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to that meat, which having touched a second-degree impurity is now impure to the third degree: <b>“It shall not be eaten,”</b> meaning that it has been rendered unfit due to impurity. And as for the <i>baraita’s</i> statement that the <b>fourth</b> level of impurity is derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference –</b> it is <b>as we said</b> just above, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference put forth by Rabbi Yosei. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | And the flesh, | Chullin 36b:13 | <b>Rather</b> the proof is <b>from the latter</b> portion of that verse: “And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. <b>And the flesh,</b> every pure person may eat flesh” (Leviticus 7:19). The Gemara explains: The second mention of the term “and the flesh” in the verse is superfluous and serves <b>to include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that with regard to sacred <b>wood and frankincense,</b> impurity disqualifies them from being burned on the altar. Are <b>wood and frankincense edible</b> and therefore included in the verse: “Of all food that may be eaten, on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34)? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish derived from this that <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>and renders their</b> status like that of <b>food. Here too,</b> in the case of a dry portion of flour that was not mixed with the oil of meal offerings, <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> it <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | which is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure | Chullin 36b:9 | The Gemara notes that it may be learned <b>by inference</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds <b>that regard for sanctity</b> renders sacred items subject to ritual impurity <b>by Torah law,</b> as his dilemma was limited to whether one counts the descending levels of impurity from those susceptible items, i.e., first-degree impurity, second-degree impurity, not the impurity of the sacred item itself. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> that <b>which is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure</b> item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 7:19), then it must be ascertained: <b>This flesh that was rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, <b>by what means</b> was it rendered susceptible? |
| Leviticus 7:19 | the verse states: “Every one that is ritually pure may eat of it” | Menachot 25b:7 | To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Every one that is ritually pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), and immediately afterward the verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches that if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which has become permitted to those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “And the flesh that touches anything impure shall not be eaten; | Pesachim 16a:9 | <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to his son: When you enter before Rav Pappa, raise</b> the following <b>contradiction before him: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that the liquids are <b>ritually pure</b> in the sense that they do not <b>transmit impurity to other</b> items <b>but they themselves are</b> susceptible to <b>impurity?</b> Is there anything that by Torah law can itself become impure but does not transmit impurity to other items? <b>Read here</b> a verse that clearly states that any item that is itself impure, including liquids, transmits impurity to other items: <b>“And the flesh that touches anything impure shall not be eaten;</b> it shall be burnt in fire” (Leviticus 7:19). |
| Leviticus 7:19 | any impure thing shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 19a:1 | <b>any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with a case <b>where</b> meat <b>touched</b> an object that was ritually impure with <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity? And nevertheless, the verse states explicitly that it is impure and assumes third-degree ritual impurity status. No other source is needed to teach that consecrated objects can assume third-degree ritual impurity status. Therefore, <b>fourth-</b>degree impurity status can be derived <b>by</b> means of the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>as we stated</b> above. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | from here: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. | Pesachim 24a:10 | <b>Rather,</b> this suggestion should be rejected, and <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that one derives this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire.</b> And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat of it” (Leviticus 7:19). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “It shall not be eaten,” what</b> does it mean when <b>the verse states: “It shall not be eaten”?</b> |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 24b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the beginning</b> of the verse: <b>“And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19)? The Gemara explains: This comes <b>to include wood and incense;</b> although they are not eaten, they are susceptible to ritual impurity of foods. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the end</b> of this verse: <b>“And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19)? The Gemara answers: This comes <b>to include</b> the <b>sacrificial parts</b> of the animal offered on the altar, such as the fats; they, too, have the legal status of meat and are susceptible to ritual impurity of foods. If these portions become ritually impure and one eats them, even if he is pure, he is liable to be flogged. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | Rav Ashi said: We, too, learned | Pesachim 35a:3 | <b>Rav Ashi said: We, too, learned</b> another case where the Sages established a higher standard. The verse says: “And the flesh that touches any ritually impure thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, anyone who is ritually pure may eat from it” (Leviticus 7:19). <b>And the flesh</b> comes <b>to include the wood</b> in the Temple <b>and the frankincense.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Do wood and frankincense</b> have the <b>capacity to become ritually impure,</b> given that they are neither food nor drink? <b>Rather,</b> the Sages established <b>a higher standard</b> for these objects due to their sanctity; <b>here too,</b> the Sages established <b>a higher standard</b> for the ritual purity of consecrated liquids. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | As it is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire; and the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh” | Pesachim 79a:19 | <b>And Rava said</b> that whenever there is any form of ritual impurity involved in the service, <b>even those who are ritually impure may also perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As it is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire; and the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “The flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire” | Pesachim 82a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the fact that <b>ritually impure</b> sacrificial meat must be burned <b>is written</b> in the Torah, as it says: <b>“The flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). <b>But</b> sacrificial meat that <b>is taken out</b> of its permissible area, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it must be burned? |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “The flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire” | Pesachim 82b:9 | The Gemara asks further: If the source of the <i>halakha</i> is an oral tradition, with regard to the verse that states: <b>“The flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), <b>why do I</b> need it? This <i>halakha</i> is included in the oral tradition and should not require its own verse. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | is derived from this verse: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten” | Sotah 29a:8 | The Gemara continues discussing the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an entity that has awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked and</b> an entity that <b>lacks awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked</b> in cases of uncertain ritual impurity <b>is derived from this verse: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). This would seem to indicate that specifically food that is <b>impure</b> for <b>certain is</b> that <b>which shall not be eaten, but</b> food for which it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>impure and uncertain</b> whether it is <b>pure can be eaten.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh” | Sotah 29a:9 | However, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the verse: <b>“And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), which would seem to indicate that specifically one who is <b>pure</b> for <b>certain is</b> one <b>who shall eat meat, but</b> one for whom it is <b>uncertain</b> whether he is <b>impure and uncertain</b> whether he is <b>pure shall not eat.</b> The two clauses in the verse seem to contradict one another with regard to the status of uncertain purity. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | As it is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten” | Sotah 29b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where in the Torah do we</b> derive that third-degree impurity applies <b>to sacrificial</b> food? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). <b>Are we not dealing</b> in the verse with meat <b>that touches</b> even an item of <b>second-</b>degree impurity? <b>And the Merciful One states</b> that it <b>“shall not be eaten,”</b> indicating that it assumes third-degree impurity. Therefore, <b>fourth-</b>degree impurity can be derived <b>by</b> means of the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference of Rabbi Yosei, <b>as we stated</b> above. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “And the flesh that touches anything impure shall not be eaten” | Yevamot 74b:16 | <b>Rava said:</b> Even <b>without</b> the rationale that <b>those</b> stringencies that apply to sacrificial food <b>are</b> more <b>numerous, you still could not say</b> that the verse that renders a woman pure at sunset refers to sacrificial food, as <b>the verse states: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure,”</b> which indicates <b>by inference that she</b> remains <b>ritually impure</b> to some degree until she has sacrificed her offerings. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that she may eat <b>sacrificial food</b> immediately after sunset, you should <b>apply here</b> what is stated in a different verse: <b>“And the flesh that touches anything impure shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), which indicates that one who is impure with any type of ritual impurity is prohibited from eating sacrificial food. <b>Rather, learn from this</b> that the verse is referring to <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:19 | as the verse states: | Zevachim 34a:6 | This is <b>as the verse states:</b> “And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire; and the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh” (Leviticus 7:19). The Sages derived that the extra term <b>“and the flesh”</b> serves <b>to include wood and frankincense, which are not fit for consumption, and even so the verse included them</b> as being susceptible to impurity, and one who eats them while he is impure is flogged. Therefore, sacrificial meat before the sprinkling of the blood, which is fit for consumption, is certainly included in the prohibition. |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten” | Zevachim 34a:7 | <b>And Rava says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>impurity of the body, but with regard to impurity of the meat all agree</b> that <b>he is not flogged. What is the reason? Since</b> one <b>does not apply to</b> meat before the sprinkling of the blood the verse: “But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings of the Lord, <b>having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20), which is referring to meat after the sprinkling of the blood, so too, one <b>does not apply to it</b> the prohibition: <b>“And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). |
| Leviticus 7:19 | with regard to the impurity of meat, | Zevachim 46b:5 | <b>One says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon is <b>with regard to the impurity of meat,</b> i.e., the item that is eaten is impure. The Rabbis maintain that one who eats impure wood or frankincense is flogged, as derived from the two mentions of flesh in the verse: “And the meat that touches any impure item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. And as for the meat, everyone who is pure may eat of it” (Leviticus 7:19). <b>But</b> if one ate wood or frankincense <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity of the body, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he is not flogged.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:19 | “And the flesh that touches any impure item” | Zevachim 46b:6 | <b>And one says: As</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to this</b> case, when the item eaten is impure, <b>so</b> is there <b>a dispute with regard to that</b> case, when the one eating the wood or frankincense is impure. <b>What is the reason</b> for this opinion? <b>Since one reads with regard to</b> these inedible items: <b>“And the flesh that touches any impure item”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), as this phrase serves to include even items such as wood and frankincense in the prohibition against eating them when they are impure, <b>one</b> likewise <b>reads with regard to</b> them the next verse: “But the person that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings…<b>having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20), which discusses one in a state of impurity who eats consecrated items. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | As it is taught | Keritot 23b:1 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against eating sacrificial meat in a state of ritual impurity: “But the soul that eats from the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The phrase <b>“which belong to the Lord”</b> serves <b>to include</b> in the prohibition of an impure person consuming sacrificial food <b>the sacrificial portions,</b> which are meant to be sacrificed upon the altar and not eaten by other people. One who eats this meat while he is impure is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | “But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings | Keritot 2b:22 | The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>How so?</b> The verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings</b> that belong to the Lord, with his ritual impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). <b>But weren’t peace offerings included in the</b> general category of all <b>sacrificial</b> offerings; <b>why,</b> then, were <b>they</b> explicitly <b>singled out</b> in this verse? |
| Leviticus 7:20 | shall be excised” | Makkot 14b:6 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And a ritually impure person who ate sacrificial</b> food, and one who entered the Temple while ritually impure, are flogged. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, one who entered the Temple</b> while ritually <b>impure</b> is flogged, as <b>a punishment is written and a prohibition is written.</b> The Gemara elaborates: There is <b>a punishment, as it is written: “He has rendered impure the Tabernacle of the Lord, and</b> that soul <b>shall be excised”</b> (Numbers 19:13). And there is <b>a prohibition,</b> as it is written: <b>“And they shall not render their camp impure”</b> (Numbers 5:3). <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a ritually impure person who ate sacrificial</b> food, <b>granted, a punishment is written: “And the soul that eats from the flesh of a peace-offering that pertains to the Lord and his impurity is upon him, and</b> that soul <b>shall be excised”</b> (Leviticus 7:20). <b>But from where is a prohibition</b> derived? |
| Leviticus 7:20 | shall be cut off | Menachot 25b:7 | To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Every one that is ritually pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), and immediately afterward the verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches that if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which has become permitted to those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:20 | “But the soul that eats from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which belong to the Lord, | Pesachim 24b:3 | The Gemara challenges: The <i>halakha</i> that these <b>sacrificial parts</b> can become impure and are then prohibited to be eaten <b>is derived from there,</b> i.e., from another source, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“But the soul that eats from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which belong to the Lord,</b> having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The added words “which belong to the Lord” come <b>to include</b> these <b>sacrificial parts,</b> which are meant to be offered to God and not eaten by other people, within this prohibition against eating sacrificial meat when it is impure. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | that pertain to the Lord, | Pesachim 96a:2 | <b>Rava said: After all, from where</b> was the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to eating the sacrificial <b>portions</b> in a state of <b>ritual impurity included?</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to eating the <b>meat</b> in a state of <b>ritual impurity, as it is written:</b> “But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings <b>that pertain to the Lord,</b> having his ritual impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20); the apparently superfluous phrase “that pertain to the Lord” is there <b>to include the</b> sacrificial <b>portions</b> and establish that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating these portions in a state of ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | with his ritual impurity upon him, | Yevamot 7a:10 | The <i>baraita</i> provides an example of this principle by citing a verse: <b>“But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings</b> that belong to the Lord, <b>with his ritual impurity upon him,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). <b>But aren’t peace-</b>offerings <b>included in</b> the general category <b>of</b> all <b>consecrated offerings? And why were they</b> explicitly <b>singled out</b> from of the rest in the above verse? <b>To draw an analogy between them and to say to you: Just as peace-</b>offerings <b>are unique</b> in that they are <b>consecrated for the altar, so too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one who eats of them is liable to receive <i>karet</i> applies to <b>all</b> food that is <b>consecrated for the altar,</b> which <b>excludes</b> objects that are <b>consecrated for the Temple maintenance.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:20 | “his impu-rity [ tumato ]” | Zevachim 33b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Sage <b>Bardela teaches</b> that this prohibition is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the term <b>“his impu-rity [<i>tumato</i>]”</b> written with regard to one who eats sacrificial meat while impure (Leviticus 7:20), and the term <b>“his impurity [<i>tumato</i>]”</b> written with regard to one who <b>enters</b> the <b>Temple</b> while impure (Numbers 19:13). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to entering the Temple while impure, the Torah <b>prescribed</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>and</b> also explicitly <b>prohibited</b> doing so, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to eating sacrificial meat while impure, the Torah <b>prescribed</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>and</b> also explicitly <b>prohibited</b> doing so. Clearly, Reish Lakish understood this verse as referring to eating sacrificial meat, not merely touching it. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | shall be cut off | Zevachim 34a:7 | <b>And Rava says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>impurity of the body, but with regard to impurity of the meat all agree</b> that <b>he is not flogged. What is the reason? Since</b> one <b>does not apply to</b> meat before the sprinkling of the blood the verse: “But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings of the Lord, <b>having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20), which is referring to meat after the sprinkling of the blood, so too, one <b>does not apply to it</b> the prohibition: <b>“And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). |
| Leviticus 7:20 | as it is taught | Zevachim 36b:11 | <b>Rava said: Know</b> that this is so, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that pertain to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The added words <b>“that pertain to the Lord”</b> serve <b>to include the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity with regard to impurity,</b> teaching that one who partakes of them while impure is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | having his impurity upon him, | Zevachim 43b:4 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Others say:</b> The verse states: “But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the Lord, <b>having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). Although this can also be read as: Having its impurity upon it, referring to the meat of the peace offerings, the verse in fact is referring to <b>one whose impurity can depart from him,</b> i.e., a person who is currently impure, but can attain a state of ritual purity by immersing in a ritual bath. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the impure <b>flesh</b> of offerings, <b>as its impurity cannot depart from it,</b> since ritually impure flesh cannot be purified. <b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is correct, the <b>impurity</b> of flesh <b>can</b> in fact <b>depart from it by means of the fire</b> of the altar. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | itself. | Zevachim 43b:7 | § The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the</b> matter <b>itself.</b> In the <i>baraita</i> the Rabbis attempt to prove that the verse: “But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20), is referring to a ritually impure person, and not to impure flesh. The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>“Having his impurity upon him”; the verse speaks of impurity of the body</b> of the person, not the impurity of the flesh of the offering. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | Since | Zevachim 43b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> there is a different proof: <b>Since</b> in this verse (Leviticus 7:20) the <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>are mentioned in the plural</b> form, i.e., “peace offerings,” <b>but</b> the <b>impurity is mentioned in the singular:</b> “Upon him,” evidently <b>the verse is speaking of impurity of the body,</b> and not impurity of the peace offerings. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> there is yet another proof: Since the next verse states: “And when anyone shall touch any impure item…<b>and eat</b> of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:21), this indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of impurity of the body,</b> as will be explained. <b>Others say</b> that the phrase <b>“having his impurity upon him”</b> proves that the reference here is to <b>one whose impurity can depart from him,</b> i.e., a person. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the impure <b>flesh</b> of offerings, <b>as</b> its <b>impurity cannot depart from it.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:20 | peace offerings | Zevachim 46a:16 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why do I</b> need <b>three</b> mentions of <b><i>karet</i> with regard to</b> one who eats <b>peace offerings</b> in a state of ritual impurity? The three verses are: “But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off [<i>venikhreta</i>] from his people” (Leviticus 7:20); “And when anyone shall touch any impure item, whether it is the impurity of man, or an impure animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain to the Lord, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:21); and: “Whoever he is of all your seed among your generations that approaches the sacred items, which the children of Israel consecrate to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 22:3). |
| Leviticus 7:20 | having his impurity upon him, | Zevachim 46b:6 | <b>And one says: As</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to this</b> case, when the item eaten is impure, <b>so</b> is there <b>a dispute with regard to that</b> case, when the one eating the wood or frankincense is impure. <b>What is the reason</b> for this opinion? <b>Since one reads with regard to</b> these inedible items: <b>“And the flesh that touches any impure item”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), as this phrase serves to include even items such as wood and frankincense in the prohibition against eating them when they are impure, <b>one</b> likewise <b>reads with regard to</b> them the next verse: “But the person that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings…<b>having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20), which discusses one in a state of impurity who eats consecrated items. |
| Leviticus 7:21 | “Non-kosher behema ,” | Chullin 71a:8 | <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to one who is unaware that he touched an impure item: <b>“Non-kosher <i>behema</i>,” and it is</b> likewise <b>stated below,</b> with regard to one who was aware that he touched an impure item: <b>“Non-kosher <i>behema</i>,”</b> in the following verse: “And when any one shall touch any impure thing, whether it is the impurity of man, or a non-kosher <i>behema</i>, and then eats of the flesh of a peace offering to the Lord, that soul shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:21). <b>Just as below,</b> the verse is referring to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, and therefore one must bring a sliding-scale offering as an atonement. |
| Leviticus 7:21 | “An impure domesticated animal” | Shevuot 7a:5 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “Or if a person will have touched any impure object, whether the carcass of an impure animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] or the carcass of an impure domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>]” (Leviticus 5:2). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Since a domesticated animal is also referred to as a <i>ḥayya</i>, it would be sufficient if <b>I would read</b> only the verse’s clause about <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>. Why</b> then is an explicit clause about <b>a <i>behema</i> stated?</b> It is in order to derive a verbal analogy. It is <b>stated</b> in the verse <b>here: “An impure domesticated animal,” and it is stated</b> in the verse <b>below</b> with regard to one who intentionally defiles an offering by partaking of it while he is impure: <b>“An impure domesticated animal”</b> (Leviticus 7:21). <b>Just as below</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods. |
| Leviticus 7:21 | Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says: | Zevachim 43b:11 | Rava cites the relevant explanation of the verse referred to by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>This</b> is what <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says:</b> The next verse states: “And when anyone shall touch any impure item, whether it is the impurity of man, or an impure animal, or any impure detestable thing, and eat of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the Lord, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:21). The beginning of that verse: “And when anyone shall touch,” and the end of that verse: “That soul shall be cut off,” are in the feminine form, whereas the middle of the verse: “And eat of the meat,” is in the masculine form, and yet it is clear that the verse is speaking of impurity of the body. The same may be said about the previous verse: <b>Since the verse begins in the feminine</b> form <b>and ends in the feminine</b> form, <b>and the masculine</b> form is used <b>in the middle, the verse</b> must be <b>speaking of impurity of the body,</b> despite the change from the feminine to the masculine. |
| Leviticus 7:21 | and eat | Zevachim 43b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> there is a different proof: <b>Since</b> in this verse (Leviticus 7:20) the <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>are mentioned in the plural</b> form, i.e., “peace offerings,” <b>but</b> the <b>impurity is mentioned in the singular:</b> “Upon him,” evidently <b>the verse is speaking of impurity of the body,</b> and not impurity of the peace offerings. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> there is yet another proof: Since the next verse states: “And when anyone shall touch any impure item…<b>and eat</b> of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:21), this indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of impurity of the body,</b> as will be explained. <b>Others say</b> that the phrase <b>“having his impurity upon him”</b> proves that the reference here is to <b>one whose impurity can depart from him,</b> i.e., a person. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the impure <b>flesh</b> of offerings, <b>as</b> its <b>impurity cannot depart from it.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:23 | fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat” | Chullin 117a:8 | <b>Rav Mari said to Rav Zevid: If</b> a sheep <b>tail is called “fat,” it should be prohibited for consumption,</b> like forbidden fat. Rav Zevid <b>said to</b> Rav Mari: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall eat no <b>fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This teaches that the Torah designates as forbidden fat only <b>an item that is</b> found <b>equally in an ox, and a sheep, and a goat.</b> Since the ox and goat do not have a tail that consists of a large amount of fat, the sheep’s fatty tail is not prohibited. |
| Leviticus 7:23 | is stated | Chullin 120a:17 | The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> one who <b>caused blood to coagulate and ate it</b> is liable. Although blood is not normally eaten in such a manner, <b>since he caused</b> the blood <b>to coagulate, he ascribed</b> the <b>significance</b> of food <b>to it,</b> and the Torah prohibits the eating of blood, as it is written: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). <b>But</b> why is one who <b>melted</b> forbidden <b>fat and swallowed it</b> liable? <b>Eating,</b> and not drinking, <b>is stated</b> in the Torah with regard to the prohibition against the consumption of forbidden fat, as it is written: “You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat” (Leviticus 7:23), <b>and this</b> swallowing of a liquid <b>is not eating.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:23 | any [ kol ] fat” | Keritot 21a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the prohibition against consuming the <b>blood of</b> a <i>koy</i>. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>its fat</b> is also forbidden? The Gemara answers that this is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall not eat <b>any [<i>kol</i>] fat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). The additional word “<i>kol</i>” serves to include the fat of a <i>koy</i> as being forbidden. The Gemara inquires further: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>its carcass</b> is prohibited? The Gemara answers that this is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall not eat <b>any [<i>kol</i>] animal carcass”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). Here too, the additional word “<i>kol</i>” serves to include the carcass of a <i>koy</i> as being prohibited. |
| Leviticus 7:23 | no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat” | Keritot 4a:25 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is the reason of the Rabbis: As Rav Mari said to Rav Zevid</b> when asked about a different issue: <b>If that is so,</b> that a sheep tail is categorized as fat by the verses and is included in the portions of an offering for which one is liable for the misuse of consecrated property, then the <b>tail of a non-sacred</b> animal <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption as forbidden fat. Rav Zevid <b>said to</b> Rav Mari: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> concerning forbidden fat: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This teaches that for the prohibition against eating forbidden fat to take effect <b>we require an item that is</b> found <b>equally in all three</b> types of animals, an ox, and a sheep, and a goat, <b>and that is not</b> the case here. Since an ox and goat do not have tails, the tail is not prohibited even in the case of a sheep. |
| Leviticus 7:23 | “You shall eat no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat” | Keritot 4a:3 | § The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i> <b>one who eats</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> which deals with the verse: <b>“You shall eat no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This verse serves <b>to render one liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every one,</b> i.e., one who eats the fat of an ox, and a sheep, and a goat is liable to receive three sets of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. And the Rabbis say he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. |
| Leviticus 7:23 | “You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat” | Keritot 4b:4 | <b>Rav Sheizevi said to Rava: Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, this is</b> the meaning of the three <b>verses that are written: “It shall be a perpetual statute</b> throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17); <b>“You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23); <b>“And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food”</b> (Leviticus 22:10), as <b>these</b> are <b>three prohibitions,</b> two for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals, as the two verses that mention fat are discussing sacrificial animals, and one for the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of consecrated food. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is their reasoning?</b> Why is one liable to receive only two sets of lashes? |
| Leviticus 7:23 | the verse states: “All fat” | Yoma 74a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition of forbidden fat: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>anything that is included in the punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>is included in the prohibition.</b> However, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>there is no prohibition</b> to eat fat of <b>a <i>koy</i>, or a half-measure</b> of forbidden fat, <b>since there is no punishment</b> for those. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “All fat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23), indicating that there is a prohibition to eat any kind of fat, including fat of uncertain status and a half-measure of fat. Therefore, a half-measure of fat is prohibited by Torah law. Reish Lakish rejects this argument: This prohibition is <b>rabbinic, and the verse</b> brought as a proof is <b>a mere support.</b> It cannot be claimed that there is such a prohibition by Torah law. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | fat. As the Master said | Chullin 103a:16 | One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ami, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>come and take effect, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with</b> forbidden <b>fat. As the Master said</b> that in the verse: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i> may be used for any other service; but you shall in no way eat of it” (Leviticus 7:24), <b>the Torah said: Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a carcass come and take effect upon the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> despite the fact that the prohibition of forbidden fat came into effect first. <b>And</b> similarly, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” teaches: <b>Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect upon the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat.</b> Consequently, one who eats forbidden fat from a <i>tereifa</i> is liable to receive two sets of lashes. Rabbi Ami holds that just as the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating forbidden fat, it also takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | from here: “And the fat of a carcass and the fat of a tereifa may be used for any purpose; but you shall not eat it” | Chullin 37a:11 | <b>Rather,</b> the fact that the meat of an animal in danger of imminent death is permitted is derived <b>from here: “And the fat of a carcass and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i> may be used for any purpose; but you shall not eat it”</b> (Leviticus 7:24). <b>And the Master says:</b> In order <b>to</b> derive <b>what <i>halakha</i></b> is this verse written? Would one imagine that because it is an unslaughtered carcass or a <i>tereifa</i> its fat would be permitted for consumption? <b>The Torah states: Let the prohibition against</b> eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass come and take effect upon the prohibition against</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> which already exists. One who eats the forbidden fat of an unslaughtered carcass is liable for violation of both prohibitions. Likewise, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse teaches: <b>Let the prohibition against</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect upon the prohibition against</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> which already exists, so that one who eats the forbidden fat of a <i>tereifa</i> is liable for transgressing both prohibitions. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | may be used for any other service; | Pesachim 23a:15 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> this dispute between Ḥizkiya and Rabbi Abbahu with regard to the implication of the phrase: It shall not be eaten, <b>is parallel to a</b> dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The verse states: “And the fat of the animal carcass, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, <b>may be used for any other service;</b> but you shall surely not eat of it” (Leviticus 7:24). <b>What</b> does it mean when <b>the verse states: “For any other service”?</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> with regard <b>to the Temple service it should be permitted</b> to use this fat for the following reason: Because fats may generally be offered on the altar, it is as though it is permitted to consume them; therefore, they may be used for other sacred purposes as well. <b>However,</b> I might have thought that with regard <b>to common use it should be prohibited</b> to use them, as the verse states: “You shall surely not eat of it.” Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For any other service,”</b> meaning that its use is permitted in all contexts. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:24 | as it is written: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a tereifa , | Zevachim 69b:11 | <b>Rav Sheizevi said to</b> the Sage who suggested this source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>If that is so,</b> one should interpret another verse likewise, <b>as it is written: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24), meaning that although the meat of a carcass imparts ritual impurity, those fats that would be forbidden even if the animal had been slaughtered do not impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | tereifa | Zevachim 69b:14 | <b>Rather,</b> the word <b><i>tereifa</i></b> in the verse concerning forbidden fat (Leviticus 7:24) <b>is necessary to exclude non-kosher</b> animals from the <i>halakha</i> in the verse and to teach that their forbidden fat is impure. The word indicates that only the forbidden fat of <b>those</b> carcasses <b>to whose species</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> applies,</b> i.e., those of kosher animals, impart impurity. Forbidden fat of a carcass of a non-kosher animal <b>is excluded, as</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> does not apply to its species.</b> The status of <i>tereifa</i> is immaterial for a non-kosher animal as its consumption is prohibited in any event. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | “And the fat of a carcass, | Zevachim 70a:1 | The Gemara challenges: According to <b>this</b> logic, one can <b>also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the forbidden fat of the carcass of a non-kosher animal is impure <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And the fat of a carcass,</b> and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>, may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24), which teaches that such forbidden fat is ritually pure. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a tereifa , | Zevachim 70a:18 | § The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> concerning the impurity of the forbidden fat of a carcass. <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse: <b>“And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24) teaches that such fat is pure, <b>the verse speaks of the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a kosher animal.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:24 | “But you shall in no way eat of it” | Zevachim 70a:4 | <b>He said to him:</b> If it is derived from the verse that the forbidden fat of a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal is pure, <b>what is different</b> about <b>a non-kosher</b> animal that would cause its forbidden fat to be impure? If the difference is <b>that its fat is not distinct from its meat,</b> as both are forbidden for consumption, <b>the fat of</b> a kosher <b>undomesticated animal is also not distinct from its meat,</b> as both are permitted. <b>And furthermore, isn’t it written</b> later in the verse: <b>“But you shall in no way eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:24)? This phrase is interpreted (70b) as excluding the fat of undomesticated animals, teaching that it is impure. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | Rather, Rava said: | Zevachim 70a:8 | <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The word <i>tereifa</i> in the verse concerning forbidden fat (Leviticus 7:24) teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. By stating: “But you shall in no way eat of it,” referring to the forbidden fat of a carcass, <b>the Torah states: Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a carcass come and take effect</b> where <b>the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat</b> already exists. One who eats the forbidden fat of a carcass is liable both for eating forbidden fat and for eating from a carcass. Likewise, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse teaches: <b>Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect</b> where <b>the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat</b> already exists, so that one who eats the forbidden fat of a <i>tereifa</i> is liable for transgressing two prohibitions. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | a tereifa | Zevachim 70b:1 | <b>When one approaches</b> the matter <b>this</b> first <b>way,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that forbidden fat is pure <b>applies</b> specifically <b>to kosher</b> animals, but <b>when one approaches</b> the matter <b>that</b> second <b>way,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>applies</b> specifically <b>to non-kosher</b> animals. To decide the matter, <b>the verse states:</b> “The fat of <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24), indicating that only the forbidden fat of <b>those</b> animals <b>to whose species</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> applies,</b> i.e., kosher animals, is ritually pure. The status of <i>tereifa</i> is immaterial to a non-kosher animal as its consumption is prohibited in any event. |
| Leviticus 7:24 | but you shall in no way eat of it” | Zevachim 70b:8 | <b>Rav Natan, father of Rav Huna bar Natan, raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i> concerning the purity of the forbidden fat of a kosher animal, mentioned in the verse: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>, may be used for any other service; <b>but you shall in no way eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:24). <b>I have</b> derived from the verse <b>only</b> that forbidden <b>fat that</b> is <b>forbidden for consumption but from which</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> is <b>permitted</b> is pure. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to the forbidden <b>fat of an ox that is stoned</b> by the court <b>or</b> the forbidden fat of <b>a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> from both of which one is prohibited from deriving benefit? |
| Leviticus 7:25 | writes “ karet ,” it is written with regard to one who eats the fat of a domesticated animal, as it is stated: “For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal… | Bekhorot 15a:16 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>The juxtaposition is effective in</b> that it <b>excludes</b> one who eats the fat of consecrated animals <b>from</b> the punishment of <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> The reason is <b>that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes “<i>karet</i>,” it is written with regard to one who eats the fat of a domesticated animal, as it is stated: “For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal…</b>even the soul that eats it shall be excised from his people” (Leviticus 7:25). The juxtaposition to a gazelle and a hart would teach that the punishment of <i>karet</i> does not apply in the case of disqualified consecrated animals. |
| Leviticus 7:25 | The verse states: | Chullin 120a:18 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One is liable even for drinking the melted forbidden fat of an animal. <b>The verse states:</b> “For all who eat the fat of the animal that one could offer from it a fire offering to the Lord, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25). The term <b>“soul”</b> is interpreted homiletically <b>to include</b> in the prohibition <b>one who drinks</b> the fat. |
| Leviticus 7:25 | in the context of sacrificial | Keritot 4a:20 | The Gemara explains: <b>When the verse</b> concerning forbidden fat <b>is written</b> it is <b>in the context of sacrificial</b> animals, since the subsequent verse concerning the prohibition against eating forbidden fat states: “For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25). The verse categorizes an animal whose fat one may not eat as an “animal of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord,” i.e., offerings. <b>And</b> one of the thirteen hermeneutical principles is: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context,</b> i.e., one interprets a verse according to the context in which it is written. Since offerings may be brought only from domesticated, not undomesticated, animals, the prohibition against eating forbidden fat applies only to such animals. |
| Leviticus 7:25 | “For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which people present | Keritot 4a:23 | All this teaches only that a separate prohibition applies to each type of animal. <b>And</b> with regard to the liability to receive lashes for eating each one <b>we derive the prohibition of:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat,” and the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute,” from the</b> example of <b><i>karet</i></b> stated in the verse: <b>“For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which people present</b> an offering of fire to the Lord, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:25). <b>Just as that</b> verse serves <b>to separate</b> and teach that if one unwittingly ate the fat of an ox, a goat, and a sheep he is liable to bring a sin offering for each one, <b>so too, this</b> verse serves <b>to separate</b> and teach that one is liable to receive lashes for eating the fat of each one. |
| Leviticus 7:25 | written with regard to the matter of sacrificial | Keritot 4b:8 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>when it is written:</b> “You shall eat no <b>fat of ox,” it is</b> also <b>written with regard to the matter of sacrificial</b> animals, as it is stated after the prohibition against eating forbidden fat: “For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25), and this is derived by employing the hermeneutical principle: A matter is derived from its context. |
| Leviticus 7:25 | “For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which men present | Pesachim 43b:5 | <b>Rav Natan, father of Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, strongly objects to this: And anywhere that</b> a verse <b>is dealing with those who eat, does</b> it necessarily <b>not</b> come to <b>include</b> additional <b>types of food</b> in the prohibition? <b>Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which men present</b> an offering of fire to God, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:25)? The Sages interpreted this verse: <b>I have</b> derived from this verse that the prohibition applies <b>only</b> to the <b>fats</b> of <b>unblemished</b> animals <b>that are fit to be sacrificed. From where</b> is it derived that it is also prohibited to eat the <b>fats of blemished animals,</b> which may not be offered as sacrifices? <b>The verse states: “Of the domesticated animal.” From where</b> is it derived that it is prohibited to eat the <b>fats of non-sacred</b> animals? <b>The verse states: “For anyone</b> who eats the fat.” Rav Natan explains his objection: <b>Here, isn’t</b> the verse <b>dealing with those who eat</b> fats, and nevertheless, its superfluous phrases come to <b>include</b> types of foods that may not <b>be eaten.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:26 | “And you shall consume no manner of blood” | Keritot 20b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall consume no manner of blood”</b> (Leviticus 7:26). <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> from here that <b>even</b> with regard to the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> i.e., human beings, and the <b>blood of eggs,</b> the <b>blood of grasshoppers,</b> and the <b>blood of fish, all</b> these are <b>included</b> in the prohibition against consuming blood. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whether it is of bird or of animal”</b> (Leviticus 7:26). |
| Leviticus 7:26 | whether it is of bird or of animal, | Keritot 21a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states: “And you shall consume no manner of blood, <b>whether it is of bird or of animal,</b> in any of your dwellings” (Leviticus 7:26). The verse mentions both “bird” and “animal,” because <b>if</b> the verse had stated only “bird,” one might have said that <b>just as a bird</b> is a creature <b>concerning which</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> does <b>not</b> apply, as will be explained, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against consuming blood applies only to <b>an animal concerning which</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> does <b>not</b> apply, whereas the blood of other animals is not forbidden. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Or of animal.”</b> |
| Leviticus 7:26 | “And you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it is of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwellings” | Keritot 4b:12 | The Gemara asks: Why is the juxtaposition necessary according to Rabbi Yehuda? <b>And what is different</b> about forbidden <b>fat that</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that one who eats it <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes even <b>without</b> needing to derive the double punishment from <b>a juxtaposition?</b> The reason must be <b>that two verses are written with regard to it: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> and: <b>“You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep.”</b> With regard to <b>blood as well,</b> even <b>without</b> deriving the <i>halakha</i> from <b>a juxtaposition,</b> one who consumes it <b>should be flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>as two prohibitions are written with regard to it: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> and the verse: <b>“And you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it is of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 7:26). |
| Leviticus 7:26 | “all” | Yoma 74b:1 | that <b>a <i>koy</i> is its own species,</b> and the uncertainty pertains not only to whether it is a wild or domestic animal, but also to whether it even can fit into one of those two categories. <b>For if you do not say so</b> and maintain that it might be its own species, how can we understand that which <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said,</b> that <b>also</b> the word <b>“all”</b> stated in the verse: “All blood you may not eat, whether of birds or of beasts” (Leviticus 7:26), comes <b>to include</b> the <b><i>koy</i>.</b> Now, if you say that the <b><i>koy</i> is a case of uncertainty, is a verse necessary to include an uncertainty? Rather,</b> the <i>koy</i> is obviously its own <b>species,</b> and therefore <b>it is different</b> and needs a special verse to include it. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of the forbidden fat, we could say that the <i>koy</i> is its own <b>species,</b> and therefore it <b>is different.</b> Consequently, Reish Lakish’s opinion cannot be proven by this <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 7:27 | “Whoever consumes any blood, | Keritot 21a:5 | The Gemara explains that when the next verse states: <b>“Whoever consumes any blood,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:27), <b>it then generalized</b> again. Therefore, this is a case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> in which case the relevant hermeneutical principle dictates that <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Accordingly, the verse includes everything that has the following three components, as stated above: The capacity for both a light form of ritual impurity and a severe form of ritual impurity; the possibility of being forbidden or permitted; and categorization as a type of meat. |
| Leviticus 7:29 | “He who offers [ hammakriv ] | Menachot 61b:11 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the phrase: <b>“The children of Israel,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the requirement of waving applies to <b>the children of Israel,</b> i.e., those who were born Jewish. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>converts and</b> to <b>emancipated</b> Canaanite <b>slaves? The verse states,</b> immediately after that phrase: <b>“He who offers [<i>hammakriv</i>]</b> his sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:29), which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of waving applies to anyone who brings his offering to the Temple, including converts and emancipated slaves. |
| Leviticus 7:30 | before the Lord” | Chullin 130a:17 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> this derivation indicates that the <b>reason</b> the giving of the breast and thigh does not apply to non-sacred animals is that <b>the Merciful One writes “this,”</b> from which it may be inferred if <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> that one is <b>obligated to</b> give the <b>breast and thigh</b> from <b>non-sacred</b> animals. <b>But</b> the procedure for giving the breast and thigh <b>requires waving,</b> and <b>where would one wave</b> the breast and thigh of a non-sacred animal? <b>If</b> it is suggested that one wave them <b>outside</b> the Temple, that cannot be done, as <b>it is written:</b> “That the breast may be waved for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 7:30), indicating that they must be waved inside the Temple. |
| Leviticus 7:30 | and it is written there: “His own hands shall bring | Kiddushin 36b:5 | Rabbi Yoshiya responded: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> through the verbal analogy of the term <b>“hand”</b> stated with regard to a <i>sota</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“hand”</b> stated with regard to <b>a peace-offering. It is written here,</b> with regard to the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the meal-offering of jealousy <b>from the woman’s hand</b> and he shall wave the meal-offering” (Numbers 5:25), <b>and it is written there: “His own hands shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30). |
| Leviticus 7:30 | when it states: “His own hands shall bring | Menachot 61b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>Or</b> perhaps this term does <b>not</b> serve to include converts and emancipated Canaanite slaves, but <b>rather this</b> is referring to the priest <b>who sacrifices [<i>hammakriv</i>]</b> the sacrificial portions on the altar? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This term cannot be referring to the priest, as <b>when it states: “His own hands shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord made by fire. The fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30), the requirement of waving by the <b>owner is stated.</b> Since the obligation of the owner to wave is stated in this verse, and the obligation of the priest is derived from the verbal analogy from the term “hand” written with regard to a peace offering, evidently both the owner and the priest must wave the offering. The Gemara asks: <b>How so?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>priest places his hands beneath the hands of the owner and waves</b> the offering together with the owner. |
| Leviticus 7:30 | “The fat upon the breast he shall bring, | Menachot 62a:3 | The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., from where is it learned, that the sacrificial portions should be placed on the bottom, and the breast and thigh on top of them? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving they shall bring upon the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave offering</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15), which indicates that the breast and thigh are placed on top of the fats, that is insufficient: <b>But isn’t it written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The fat upon the breast he shall bring,</b> that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30)? That verse leads to the opposite conclusion, as it indicates that the fats are to be placed on top of the breast. |
| Leviticus 7:30 | it | Menachot 62b:9 | The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> the guilt offering of a leper, as the verse states <b>with regard to peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual:</b> “His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring; the breast, to wave <b>it</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30). The word <b>“it”</b> serves <b>to exclude the guilt offering of a leper</b> from the requirement of waving after the animal has been slaughtered. |
| Leviticus 7:30 | before the Lord” | Menachot 81a:5 | The Gemara responds: This too is not a valid remedy, <b>because there are four</b> loaves of the forty that one must <b>wave. How would he perform</b> the mitzva of waving them? <b>Shall he wave them outside</b> the Temple courtyard? He may not, since “waved for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 7:30) <b>is written</b> in the verse, and waving performed outside the Temple courtyard is not considered “before the Lord.” Shall he wave them <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard? <b>He</b> will have <b>brought non-sacred food into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Therefore,</b> it is <b>not possible.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:30 | “His own hands [ yadav ] shall bring | Menachot 93b:16 | Reish Lakish <b>raised objections against him</b> from <b>twenty-four</b> occasions where the Torah writes: <b>His hands,</b> for example: <b>“His own hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30); <b>“his hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall contend for him,</b> and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7); <b>“Guiding his hands [<i>yadav</i>] wittingly,</b> for Manasseh was the firstborn” (Genesis 48:14). Rabbi Elazar <b>was silent,</b> as he had no response. |
| Leviticus 7:30 | “His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire; | Sukkah 47b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> How does he derive the waving of the first fruits from this verse? The Gemara answers: This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“hand”</b> written with regard to first fruits and the term <b>“hand”</b> written with regard to <b>a peace-offering. It is written here,</b> with regard to first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to a peace-offering: <b>“His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire;</b> the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30). |
| Leviticus 7:31 | Therefore, the verse states: “And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar, | Pesachim 59b:3 | <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana, and some say it Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan,</b> said <b>to Rav Pappa: But, isn’t</b> it the case that <b>as long as the sacrificial parts</b> of the sin-offering <b>have not been burned</b> on the altar, <b>the priests may not eat the meat? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to peace-offerings: I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that the priests would be permitted</b> to eat <b>the breast and thigh,</b> which are designated for them from the peace-offering, <b>prior to burning the sacrificial parts</b> of the offering on the altar. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar,</b> and the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons” (Leviticus 7:31). From here it is derived that the priest is first obligated to burn the fat, <b>and</b> only <b>then: “The breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:31 | the verse states: “And the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons” | Pesachim 59b:5 | <b>He said to him: Since it is impossible</b> to complete the offering any other way, due to the positive <i>mitzva</i> of completion, <b>they rendered</b> these sacrificial parts <b>as ones that became ritually impure or were lost.</b> In those cases, it is permitted for priests to eat their portions. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if the sacrificial parts became ritually impure or were lost, the priests would not be entitled to the breast and thigh,</b> the eating of which ordinarily depends upon burning the sacrificial parts on the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Leviticus 7:31), which indicates that <b>in any event</b> it is an absolute gift, even if some of the accompanying rites were not performed in the proper manner. |
| Leviticus 7:32 | the right thigh | Chullin 134b:20 | The Gemara above cited a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the right foreleg is given to the priest. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the following <i>baraita</i> <b>cites</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the gift to the priest from a peace offering: “And <b>the right thigh</b> you shall give to the priest as a gift from your sacrifices of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:32). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the right thigh</b> of a peace offering is given to the priest. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the right <b>foreleg</b> of the <b>sacrificial</b> ram of the nazirite is given to the priest? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall give to the priest as <b>a gift.”</b> And <b>from where</b> is it derived that the right <b>foreleg</b> of <b>a non-sacred</b> animal is also given as a gift to the priest? <b>The verse states: “You shall give.”</b> |
| Leviticus 7:33 | that sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings, | Bekhorot 30b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a Levite who comes to accept the matters of a Levite, or a priest who comes to accept the matters of priesthood, except for one matter, he is not accepted. As it is stated:</b> “He among the sons of Aaron, <b>that sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings,</b> and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion” (Leviticus 7:33). This means that with regard to <b>the</b> Temple <b>service, which is handed</b> over <b>to the sons of Aaron, any priest who does not admit to it</b> in its entirety <b>has no share in the priesthood.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:33 | priesthood, as it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, who offers [ hamakriv ] the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion” | Chullin 132b:15 | <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: One may not give a gift to any priest who is not an expert in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to all <b>twenty-four gifts of the priesthood.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> this <b>is not correct, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any priest who does not believe in</b> the validity of the Temple <b>service has no portion in</b> any of the gifts given to the <b>priesthood, as it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, who offers [<i>hamakriv</i>] the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). The word “<i>hamakriv</i>,” which literally means: Who brings it close, indicates that only one who believes in the validity of conveying the blood to the altar is entitled to receive the right thigh of the offering, as only one who believes in the rite would perform it. |
| Leviticus 7:33 | the priesthood. As it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, that offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion” | Menachot 18b:6 | § Based on the Gemara’s earlier inference that when the mishna states that the meal offering is valid even if the priest did not pour the oil it is referring to a case where a non-priest did perform this action, the Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any priest who does not admit to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites has no portion in</b> the gifts of <b>the priesthood. As it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, that offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). This teaches that one who <b>admits to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> and accepts responsibility for them <b>has a portion in the priestly</b> gifts, but one <b>who does not admit to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites does not have a portion in the priestly</b> gifts. |
| Leviticus 7:33 | offering itself is called shelamim , as it is written: “Who sacrifices the blood of the peace offering [ shelamim ]” | Menachot 3b:16 | The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the <b>offering itself is called <i>shelamim</i>, as it is written: “Who sacrifices the blood of the peace offering [<i>shelamim</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and it is also written: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14). <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>is a meal offering itself called mixed?</b> It <b>is written: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), indicating that there is a meal offering that <b>is called: Mixed with oil,</b> but <b>it is not simply called: Mixed.</b> One’s intent to sacrifice a dry meal offering for the sake of mixing is therefore not a reference to the offering itself. |
| Leviticus 7:33 | who sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings and the fat | Zevachim 102b:7 | The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> A priest <b>never partakes,</b> i.e., receives a share, of sacrificial meat, <b>unless he is pure from the time of sprinkling until the time of the burning of the fats, as the verse states:</b> “He among the sons of Aaron <b>who sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings and the fat</b> shall have the right thigh for a portion” (Leviticus 7:33). The verse <b>requires</b> that the priest be pure <b>even</b> at the time of <b>the burning of the fats.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:33 | “Who offers the blood of the peace offering” | Zevachim 4a:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> in other verses: <b>“Who offers the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14), <b>and</b> the term: <b>A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>], is not written,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> in this verse, the term: <b>“A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>]</b> of peace offerings,” <b>is written, learn from it that</b> the <b>slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>] must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:33 | Rather, the verse states: “Who sacrifices [ hamakriv ] the blood of the peace offering” | Zevachim 4a:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “Who sacrifices [<i>hamakriv</i>] the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), referring to the one who collects the blood of the offering, as the Gemara will explain. This phrase indicates <b>that</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a peace offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:33 | does not receive a share of the meat, as it is stated: “He that sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, from among the sons of Aaron, shall have the right thigh for a portion” | Zevachim 98b:10 | <b>Even</b> if the priest was <b>ritually impure</b> only <b>at the time of the sprinkling of the blood</b> of the offering <b>and</b> he was <b>pure at the time of the burning of</b> the <b>fats</b> of that offering, he still <b>does not receive a share of the meat, as it is stated: “He that sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, from among the sons of Aaron, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). One who cannot sprinkle the blood does not receive a share in the meat. |
| Leviticus 7:34 | and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a due forever | Chullin 130a:3 | Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “For the breast of waving and the thigh of giving I have taken of the children of Israel from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, <b>and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a due forever</b> from the children of Israel” (Leviticus 7:34), from which it is derived that the priest <b>has only that which is stated with regard to</b> that <b>matter,</b> i.e., the breast and the thigh, and not the foreleg, the jaw and the maw. |
| Leviticus 7:34 | GEMARA: | Chullin 130a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the verse: “And have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons” (Leviticus 7:34), indicates that only the breast and thigh, which are the subject of that verse, are given from sacrificial animals to the priest, but gifts of the priesthood are not given from sacrificial animals. The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> sacrificial animals are not included in the mitzva of gifts of the priesthood is due to the fact <b>that the Merciful One writes: “Them,”</b> in reference to the breast and the thigh of sacrificial animals. <b>But</b> were it <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> by <i>a fortiori</i> inference that <b>sacrificial</b> animals are <b>obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from them. |
| Leviticus 7:34 | of the Rabbis | Menachot 62b:2 | <b>Ravina said</b> an explanation which is the opposite of Rav Pappa’s: <b>Everyone,</b> even the Rabbis, agrees that the guiding principle is: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place. And this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one waves only the breast and thigh of communal peace offerings: The verse states with regard to individual peace offerings: “For the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving I have taken from the children of Israel out of their sacrifices of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as an eternal portion from among the children of Israel” (Leviticus 7:34). The term: <b>“Their</b> sacrifices of <b>peace offerings,”</b> is in the plural, despite the fact that the verse is referring to individual peace offerings. This <b>is an amplification,</b> which teaches that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to communal peace offerings, i.e., that only the breast and the thigh are to be waved. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | which is written: “This is the law [ torah ] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, | Menachot 110a:11 | § The Gemara cites similar interpretations of verses: <b>Reish Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law [<i>torah</i>] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering,</b> and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37)? This teaches that <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study is considered <b>as though he sacrificed a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:37 | does not invalidate | Menachot 19a:16 | The Gemara questions this understanding of Rav’s statement: <b>But</b> what of <b>the rest of the offerings, as</b> the term <b>“law” is written with regard to them, and</b> yet failure to perform all of their different rites <b>does not invalidate</b> those offerings? The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). The Gemara answers: When the term <b>law</b> appears, it is still <b>necessary</b> for the term <b>statute</b> to appear, in order to teach that failure to perform the rites invalidates the offering. <b>But</b> when the term <b>statute</b> appears, it is <b>not necessary</b> for the term <b>law</b> to appear as well. The term statute is sufficient. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” | Menachot 82b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who rejects the proofs of Rabbi Eliezer, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>that the Paschal offering comes only from non-sacred</b> money? The Gemara responds: Rabbi Akiva <b>derives it from that which Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> It is stated: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:37). This verse connects all of the specified offerings, such that individual aspects of each offering are applicable to all of the offerings. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | “This is the law | Menachot 83a:8 | § <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> in the name of Rabbi Akiva</b> that the verse states: <b>“This is the law</b> of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). From the term <b>“meal offering”</b> it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> whatever it touches <b>is sanctified through</b> the substance that becomes <b>absorbed,</b> as it is stated: “Whatever shall touch them shall be sacred” (Leviticus 6:11), <b>so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned in this verse, whatever they touch <b>is sanctified through</b> the <b>absorbed</b> portions. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | Rather, the verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” | Zevachim 4b:25 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:37). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> all types of offerings <b>with peace offerings,</b> indicating that <b>just as we require</b> the sacrifice of <b>a peace offering</b> to be performed <b>for its sake, both</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner, so too, we require</b> the sacrifice of <b>every</b> type of offering to be performed <b>for its sake, both</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:37 | Rather, Rava says: The verse: “This is the law | Zevachim 5b:4 | <b>Rather, Rava says: The verse: “This is the law</b> of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37), <b>juxtaposes</b> a guilt offering <b>with a peace offering,</b> indicating that <b>just as peace offerings are offerings and</b> if one <b>slaughtered them not for their sake, they are fit but do not propitiate, so too, I shall include a guilt offering, as it is an offering,</b> and therefore if it is slaughtered not for its sake, although it is fit, it does not satisfy the obligation of its owner. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering, and of the meal offering, | Zevachim 7b:19 | <b>Rav Ashi says: We do not say</b> that <b>since</b> the Torah <b>revealed</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is indispensable to slaughter, it thereby <b>revealed</b> that it is indispensable to the other rites as well. <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that it is indispensable to the other sacrificial <b>rites?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering, and of the meal offering,</b> and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37), indicating that all offerings must, like a peace offering, be sacrificed for their own sake. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | the verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, and of the meal offering, | Zevachim 8a:20 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from that which <b>the verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, and of the meal offering,</b> and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> a sin offering <b>with a peace offering,</b> indicating that <b>just as</b> for <b>a peace offering we require</b> intent <b>for its sake, as a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>both</b> concerning the <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner, so too,</b> for <b>a sin offering we require</b> intent <b>for its sake as a mitzva, both</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b> |
| Leviticus 7:37 | “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” | Zevachim 97b:7 | § With regard to a sin offering, the verse states: “Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be sacred.” The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source teaching <b>that</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> whatever it touches <b>becomes sanctified through that which is absorbed</b> from the sin offering. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is also the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the rest of the sacred</b> offerings? <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> It is stated: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:37). This verse connects all of the specified offerings, such that individual aspects of each offering are applicable to all of the offerings. |
| Leviticus 7:37 | a finger, | Zevachim 98a:11 | The Gemara suggest: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> Where the verse mentions <b>a finger,</b> it <b>is not necessary</b> for the verse to mention <b>priesthood;</b> but where it mentions <b>priesthood,</b> it <b>is necessary</b> for the verse to mention <b>a finger,</b> in order to teach that the rite must be performed with the right hand, which is not self-evident. With regard to the assorted offerings itemized in the verse (Leviticus 7:37), the Torah does not mention a finger; therefore, they must be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a sin offering. |
| Leviticus 7:38 | “In the day that he commanded | Chullin 22a:9 | The Gemara objects: The <i>halakha</i> that the bird burnt offering is sacrificed only <b>during the day is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“In the day that he commanded</b> the children of Israel to present their offerings” (Leviticus 7:38), not from the <i>halakha</i> of the animal sin offering. The Gemara explains: The requirement of sacrificing the bird burnt offering during the day is not derived from the <i>halakha</i> of the animal sin offering, and it was <b>cited</b> in that list incidentally, <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 7:38 | “On the day of His commanding” | Menachot 83a:12 | The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to derive from the <i>halakha</i> of a sin offering that an offering is sacrificed <b>in the daytime?</b> Isn’t this principle <b>derived from</b> the expression: <b>“On the day of His commanding”</b> (Leviticus 7:38), which is understood to be referring to all offerings? The Gemara answers: Indeed, the <i>baraita</i> <b>cited</b> the principle from the model of a sin offering <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>],</b> and it was mentioned here on account of the other principles. |
| Leviticus 7:38 | offerings, as it is written: “On the day that He commanded [ tzavoto ] the children of Israel | Yoma 2b:2 | Again the Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that there is a verbal analogy between the term commanded in the context of the inauguration and the term <b>commanded</b> with regard to <b>offerings, as it is written: “On the day that He commanded [<i>tzavoto</i>] the children of Israel</b> to sacrifice their offerings” (Leviticus 7:38). The result would be that any priest sacrificing a communal offering would require sequestering for seven days. The Gemara rejects this: <b>One derives</b> the term <b>commanded from</b> the identical term <b>commanded, and one does not derive</b> the term <b>that he commanded [<i>tzavoto</i>] from</b> the term <b>commanded [<i>tziva</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 7:38 | “In the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings” | Zevachim 7b:20 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse: <b>“In the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:38), <b>this</b> word, i.e., “offerings,” is referring to the <b>firstborn</b> animal, the animal <b>tithe, and</b> the <b>Paschal offering,</b> which are not mentioned in the previous verse. |
| Leviticus 7:38 | “On the day of His commanding” | Zevachim 98a:9 | The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to derive from the <i>halakha</i> of a sin offering that an offering is sacrificed <b>in the daytime?</b> Is this principle not <b>derived from</b> the conspicuous expression: <b>“On the day of His commanding”</b> (Leviticus 7:38), which is understood to be referring to all offerings? The Gemara answers: Indeed, the <i>baraita</i> <b>cited</b> the principle from the model of a sin offering <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>],</b> and it was mentioned here on account of the other principles. |
| Leviticus 8:5 | The verse states: “And Moses said to the assembly: This is the matter [ davar ] that God has commanded | Yoma 5b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even</b> failure to <b>read the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> of the inauguration <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration? <b>The verse states: “And Moses said to the assembly: This is the matter [<i>davar</i>] that God has commanded</b> to be done” (Leviticus 8:5), teaching that <b>even</b> failure to perform the <b>recitation [<i>dibbur</i>]</b> of the Torah portion to the people <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration. |
| Leviticus 8:7 | which is written: “And he girded him with the belt” | Yoma 5b:9 | <b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to the <b>tunic and mitre everyone agrees that</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and afterward his sons, as both in</b> the portion of <b>the command</b> concerning the inauguration <b>and in</b> the portion of <b>the implementation,</b> mention of <b>Aaron precedes</b> mention of his sons. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to the belt.</b> The Gemara elaborates. The <b>one who said:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and afterward his sons</b> derives it from that <b>which is written: “And he girded him with the belt”</b> (Leviticus 8:7), <b>and then it is written: “And he girded them with belts”</b> (Leviticus 8:13). Moses first dressed Aaron in all of the garments, including the belt, and then Moses dressed Aaron’s sons. <b>And</b> the <b>one who said:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and his sons, simultaneously</b> derives it from that <b>which is</b> subsequently <b>written: “And gird them</b> with belts, Aaron and his sons” (Exodus 29:9), indicating that Moses girded them all with belts simultaneously. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to the one who says:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and his sons simultaneously, isn’t it written: He girded him with the belt, and then it is written: He girded them with belts,</b> clearly indicating that he dressed Aaron and then his sons? |
| Leviticus 8:10 | “And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the Tabernacle and all that was in it | Horayot 11b:9 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the Tabernacle and all that was in it</b> and sanctified them” (Leviticus 8:10). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the anointing oil that Moses prepared in the wilderness, how many miracles were performed in its</b> regard continuously, <b>from beginning to end? Initially it was only twelve <i>log</i>. Consider how much</b> oil <b>a pot absorbs, and how much</b> oil is <b>absorbed by the roots, and how much</b> oil <b>the fire burns, and</b> yet <b>the Tabernacle, and its vessels, Aaron, and his sons</b> were <b>anointed with it</b> for the <b>entire seven days of inauguration, and High Priests and kings were anointed with it</b> throughout the generations. |
| Leviticus 8:10 | “And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the Tabernacle | Keritot 5b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the Tabernacle</b> and all that was in it and sanctified them” (Leviticus 8:10). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the anointing oil that Moses prepared in the wilderness, many miracles were performed with it, from its initial</b> preparation <b>to its end.

| Leviticus 8:12 | as it is written: “And he poured from the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him to sanctify him” | Horayot 12a:6 | <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the one who said</b> that <b>pouring</b> oil on his head <b>is preferable?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And he poured from the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him to sanctify him”</b> (Leviticus 8:12), indicating that pouring precedes anointing. <b>And the one who said</b> that <b>anointing is preferable</b> and takes precedence, <b>what is the reason</b> for his opinion? <b>He holds:</b> Anointing takes precedence <b>as</b> that is what <b>you find with regard to service vessels</b> (see Numbers 7:1). They were anointed, but the anointing oil was not poured on them. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“And he poured,” and ultimately: “And anointed”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> that <b>he poured</b> the oil? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he</b> had already <b>anointed</b> them. Anointing is the primary component of the process. |
| Leviticus 8:12 | preferable? As it is stated: “And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head | Keritot 5b:22 | The Gemara explains: This <b>is</b> a matter of dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as <b>there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who says: Anointing</b> between his eyelashes is <b>preferable</b> to pouring on the head and therefore comes first, <b>and there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who says</b> that <b>pouring</b> on the head is <b>preferable</b> to anointing between his eyelashes, and therefore comes first. <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that <b>pouring</b> on the head is <b>preferable? As it is stated: “And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head</b> and anointed him to sanctify him” (Leviticus 8:12), which indicates that pouring is first, followed by anointing. <b>And</b> as for <b>the one who says</b> that <b>anointing</b> between his eyelashes is <b>preferable</b> to pouring on the head and precedes it, <b>he holds</b> that anointing is preferable <b>in that</b> its use <b>is increased,</b> i.e., it is performed <b>on the service vessels,</b> whereas pouring is not mentioned with regard to the service vessels. |
| Leviticus 8:12 | isn’t it written: “He poured,” and ultimately: “He anointed” | Keritot 5b:23 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> according to the opinion that anointing is preferable, <b>isn’t it written: “He poured,” and ultimately: “He anointed”</b> (Leviticus 8:12)? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> for <b>“he poured”?</b> This action was made possible <b>due to</b> the fact that he had already: <b>“Anointed him to sanctify him.”</b> In other words, the pouring came after the anointing, which is the primary act. |
| Leviticus 8:13 | and then it is written: “And he girded them with belts” | Yoma 5b:9 | <b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to the <b>tunic and mitre everyone agrees that</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and afterward his sons, as both in</b> the portion of <b>the command</b> concerning the inauguration <b>and in</b> the portion of <b>the implementation,</b> mention of <b>Aaron precedes</b> mention of his sons. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to the belt.</b> The Gemara elaborates. The <b>one who said:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and afterward his sons</b> derives it from that <b>which is written: “And he girded him with the belt”</b> (Leviticus 8:7), <b>and then it is written: “And he girded them with belts”</b> (Leviticus 8:13).

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to the one who says:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and his sons simultaneously, isn’t it written: He girded him with the belt, and then it is written: He girded them with belts,</b> clearly indicating that he dressed Aaron and then his sons? |
| Leviticus 8:15 | around | Zevachim 53b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: It is stated here:</b> “Shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the sin offering sacrificed at the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the corners of the altar <b>around</b> with his finger” (Leviticus 8:15). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the sin offering, the blood was placed <b>discretely and</b> with <b>four placements,</b> one on each corner, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a burnt offering, it must be placed <b>discretely and</b> with <b>four placements.</b> This opinion accords with the opinion of Rav. |
| Leviticus 8:15 | around | Zevachim 57a:3 | <b>Abaye says: Why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write:</b> “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), <b>with regard to a burnt offering,</b> to teach that the blood must be placed on all four sides of the altar, in addition to writing: “And Moses took the blood, and put it upon the corners of the altar <b>around</b> with his finger” (Leviticus 8:15), <b>with regard to a sin offering? They are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they teach the same matter; <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. Therefore, a firstborn offering, an animal tithe offering, and a Paschal offering do not require two placements that are four. |
| Leviticus 8:26 | the verse states: “And out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer” | Menachot 78a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the loaves that accompanied the ram of the inauguration of the Tabernacle consisted of the three types of <i>matza</i> brought with a thanks offering: Loaves, wafers, and loaves poached in water and made with oil. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said:</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer”</b> (Leviticus 8:26). <b>Granted, “cakes”</b> are <b>cakes,</b> and <b>“wafer”</b> is <b>a wafer.</b> But <b>what is “oiled</b> bread” referring to? Is this <b>not</b> referring to <i>matza</i> <b>poached</b> in water and made with oil? |
| Leviticus 8:29 | it was Moses’ portion of the ram of inauguration, | Zevachim 101b:14 | § <b>Rav says: Moses, our teacher,</b> was <b>a High Priest and would receive a share of offerings</b> consecrated <b>to Heaven, as it is stated:</b> “And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord; <b>it was Moses’ portion of the ram of inauguration,</b> as the Lord commanded Moses” (Leviticus 8:29). |
| Leviticus 8:31 | opening | Yoma 5b:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One <b>derives a</b> verbal analogy between the word opening that appears in the two portions of the inauguration. It is written in the command concerning the inauguration: “The <b>opening</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 29:32), and in its fulfillment it is written: “The <b>opening</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 8:31). Failure to perform the matters written in both portions invalidates the inauguration.<br><b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> The verbal analogy is unnecessary, as the conclusion can be derived directly from the verse written with regard to the implementation of the inauguration: <b>“And keep the charge of the Lord,</b> that you not die, for so I am commanded” (Leviticus 8:35). The emphasis on this being the charge of the Lord comes to teach that failure to perform all the details mentioned in the implementation of the command <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration. <br><b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The phrase: <b>For so I am commanded,</b> is the source from which it is derived that all the details written in both portions <b>invalidate</b> the inauguration. |
| Leviticus 8:31 | Cook the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting; and eat it there” | Zevachim 56a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the offerings brought at the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons: <b>Cook the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting; and eat it there”</b> (Leviticus 8:31). This indicates that the eating of offerings had to be at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. The Gemara answers: <b>Offerings</b> that were sacrificed only one <b>time are different.</b> Since they were specifically commanded for just that time, one cannot derive from there any <i>halakhot</i> with regard to offerings in general. |
| Leviticus 8:34 | as the verse states: “As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” | Yoma 2a:8 | § With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of sequestering the High Priest prior to performance of the Yom Kippur service, and of sequestering the priest designated to burn the heifer prior to performance of the red heifer ritual, the Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the Torah <b>are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Minyomi bar Ḥilkiya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Maḥseya bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> they are derived from Aaron and his sons, who remained in the Tabernacle for seven days prior to performing the service in the Tabernacle on the eighth day of their inauguration, <b>as the verse states: “As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you”</b> (Leviticus 8:34), meaning that this mitzva of sequestering was not limited to the days prior to the dedication of the Tabernacle; rather, it applies to future generations as well. The verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>“To do”; these are the actions</b> performed in the burning of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer</b> for which the priest performing the ritual is sequestered seven days in advance; <b>“to make atonement”; these are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> before which the High Priest is sequestered seven days. |
| Leviticus 8:34 | this | Yoma 2b:11 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>And is it not an <i>a fortiori</i> inference? Now,</b> if <b>a matter before which there is not sanctity requires sequestering,</b> due to its sanctity, then with regard to <b>a matter before which there is sanctity, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that it should require sequestering? <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said</b> in rejection of this challenge: <b>No,</b> there is no <i>a fortiori</i> inference here, as the verse: “As has been done <b>this</b> day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” (Leviticus 8:34), <b>is written</b> to emphasize specifically a day <b>like this</b> day; precisely as it was for the inauguration, and not in any other situation. |
| Leviticus 8:34 | “As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” | Yoma 3b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Minyomi bar Ḥilkiya say</b> that <b>Rabbi Maḥseya bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the verse states: <b>“As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you”</b> (Leviticus 8:34), from which it is derived: <b>To do, these are the actions</b> performed in the burning <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer; to make atonement, these are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur?</b> Apparently, even Rabbi Yoḥanan taught two cases derived from inauguration. The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>That is</b> the opinion <b>of his teacher;</b> however, he himself disagrees. <b>As when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: To do, these are the actions</b> performed in the burning <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer; to atone, these are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur.</b> That which Rabbi Manyumei cited in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan was the opinion of his teacher, Rabbi Yishmael. |
| Leviticus 8:34 | “As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” | Yoma 4a:7 | <b>And if you say</b> that at the <b>inauguration</b> the sprinkling was with <b>blood,</b> and <b>here</b> the sprinkling was with <b>water, you said: Water replaced blood. And it says</b> in the verse: <b>“As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you”</b> (Leviticus 8:34). <b>To do, these are the actions</b> performed in the burning <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer; to make atonement, these are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur.</b> This <i>baraita</i>, then, is proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. |
| Leviticus 8:35 | days” | Sukkah 43a:11 | <b>Or,</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and say the opposite. <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>: <b>Days, and it is stated with regard to the inauguration</b> of the Tabernacle: “And at the door of the Tent of Meeting you shall reside day and night seven <b>days”</b> (Leviticus 8:35). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the inauguration of the Tabernacle, the meaning is <b>days and even nights, so too here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the meaning is <b>days and even nights.</b> A source exists for either possibility. |
| Leviticus 8:35 | you shall reside | Sukkah 43b:1 | <b>“You shall reside,” “you shall reside,”</b> by means <b>of a verbal analogy. It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>: <b>“You shall reside</b> in <i>sukkot</i> seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), <b>and it is stated with regard to the inauguration</b> of the Tabernacle: “And at the door of the Tent of Meeting <b>you shall reside</b> day and night seven days” (Leviticus 8:35). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the inauguration, the meaning is <b>days and even nights, so too here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the meaning is <b>days and even nights.</b> |

| Leviticus 8:35 | “For so I am commanded” | Yoma 5b:3 | Apropos that phrase, the Gemara cites a related halakhic midrash. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the context of the implementation of the inauguration, three variations of the phrase appear: <b>“For so I am commanded”</b> (Leviticus 8:35); <b>“as I commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:18); and <b>“as God has commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:15). What does this repetition teach? From the phrase: <b>“For so I am commanded,”</b> it is derived that even in a state of <b>acute mourning,</b> on the first day after the death of a relative, one must <b>eat</b> the offering. God stated the verse: <b>“As I commanded,” at the time of the incident</b> just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning. And when Moses states: <b>“As God commanded,”</b> he is saying: The command is from God <b>and</b> it is <b>not from my</b> own initiative that <b>I am saying</b> it. |
| Leviticus 9:1 | until “And it came to pass on the eighth day” | Gittin 60a:13 | The Gemara comments: The question of whether or not writing a scroll for a child is permitted is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not write a scroll</b> containing only one portion of the Torah <b>for</b> the purpose of enabling <b>a child to study, but if</b> the writer’s <b>intention is to complete</b> the scroll, <b>it is permitted. Rabbi Yehuda says: In</b> the book of <b>Genesis</b> he may write a scroll from the beginning <b>until the generation of the flood. In <i>Torat Kohanim</i>,</b> the book of Leviticus, he may write a scroll from the beginning <b>until “And it came to pass on the eighth day”</b> (Leviticus 9:1). |
| Leviticus 9:1 | But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [ vayhi ] on the eighth day” | Megillah 10b:8 | After citing several verses where <i>vayhi</i> portends grief, the Gemara mentions a number of verses that seem to indicate otherwise. <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day”</b> (Leviticus 9:1), which was the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that day: <b>On that day there was joy before the Holy One, Blessed be He, similar to</b> the joy that existed on the <b>day on which the heavens and earth were created.</b> The Gemara cites a verbal analogy in support of this statement. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day,” and it is written there,</b> in the Creation story: <b>“And it was [<i>vayhi</i>]</b> evening, and it was <b>morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). This indicates that there was joy on the eighth day, when the Tabernacle was dedicated, similar to the joy that existed on the day the world was created. Apparently, the term <i>vayhi</i> is not necessarily a portent of grief. |
| Leviticus 9:2 | “And he said to Aaron: Take you a young calf for a sin-offering” | Yoma 3b:4 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> instances of <b>taking in general and</b> instances of <b>making in general:</b> Instances of <b>taking in general</b> are as in the verse: <b>“Take you spices”</b> (Exodus 30:34); and instances of <b>making in general</b> are as in the verse: <b>“Make you two silver trumpets”</b> (Numbers 10:2). <b>However,</b> in <b>these</b> cases of inauguration and of Yom Kippur <b>the verses explicitly</b> teach that the offerings must be <b>from your own</b> property. <b>With regard to</b> the <b>inauguration, now, since it is written: “And to the children of</b> Israel <b>you will speak, saying: Take a goat kid for a sin-offering</b> and an unblemished year-old calf and lamb for burnt-offerings” (Leviticus 9:3), with regard to the verse: <b>“And he said to Aaron: Take you a young calf for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 9:2), <b>why do I</b> need this clear difference between the formulation of the command to the Jewish people and the formulation of the command to Aaron? <b>Learn from it</b> that in this context the phrase: <b>Take you,</b> means <b>from your own</b> property. |
| Leviticus 9:3 | you will speak, saying: Take a goat kid for a sin-offering | Yoma 3b:4 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> instances of <b>taking in general and</b> instances of <b>making in general:</b> Instances of <b>taking in general</b> are as in the verse: <b>“Take you spices”</b> (Exodus 30:34); and instances of <b>making in general</b> are as in the verse: <b>“Make you two silver trumpets”</b> (Numbers 10:2). <b>However,</b> in <b>these</b> cases of inauguration and of Yom Kippur <b>the verses explicitly</b> teach that the offerings must be <b>from your own</b> property. <b>With regard to</b> the <b>inauguration, now, since it is written: “And to the children of</b> Israel <b>you will speak, saying: Take a goat kid for a sin-offering</b> and an unblemished year-old calf and lamb for burnt-offerings” (Leviticus 9:3), with regard to the verse: <b>“And he said to Aaron: Take you a young calf for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 9:2), <b>why do I</b> need this clear difference between the formulation of the command to the Jewish people and the formulation of the command to Aaron? <b>Learn from it</b> that in this context the phrase: <b>Take you,</b> means <b>from your own</b> property. |
| Leviticus 9:4 | meal offering of the eighth | Menachot 59a:11 | In the phrase “it is a meal offering,” the term <b>“meal offering”</b> serves <b>to include</b> in the obligation of frankincense the <b>meal offering of the eighth</b> day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. With regard to that offering the verse states: “And a meal offering mixed with oil” (Leviticus 9:4), but it does not mention frankincense. Therefore, the term “meal offering” written in the context of the <i>omer</i> meal offering serves to apply the requirement <b>of frankincense</b> to the meal offering of the eighth day of inauguration. And the term <b>“it is”</b> in the same phrase serves <b>to exclude the two loaves</b> sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, to indicate <b>that they will require neither oil nor frankincense.</b> |
| Leviticus 9:9 | as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him” | Moed Katan28b:13 | Having been granted permission to speak, <b>Rabbi Tarfon answered and said:</b> With regard to the death of Aaron’s sons it says: <b>“But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the Lord has kindled”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Nadav and Avihu, who had performed only one mitzva</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him”</b> (Leviticus 9:9), <b>this</b> was nevertheless stated about them, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who were well known for their performance of many mitzvot, <b>all the more so</b> should the entire Jewish people bewail their death. |
| Leviticus 9:16 | “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation” | Beitzah 20a:5 | § <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Abba:</b> The verse concerning the burnt-offering that Aaron was commanded to sacrifice for the inauguration of the Tabernacle: <b>“And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation”</b> (Leviticus 9:16), indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of an obligatory burnt-offering is <b>similar to the regulation</b> governing <b>a gift burnt-offering.</b> This <b>teaches with regard to an obligatory burnt-offering</b> that it too <b>requires</b> the person bringing the offering to <b>place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the animal to be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 9:16 | “And the burnt offering was presented, and he sacrificed in accordance with the ordinance” | Menachot 93b:3 | This is <b>as a <i>tanna</i> taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the presence of Rav Yitzḥak bar Abba:</b> With regard to the obligatory offering brought by Aaron the High Priest on the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, it is written: <b>“And the burnt offering was presented, and he sacrificed in accordance with the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 9:16). This last phrase means: <b>In accordance with the ordinance of a voluntary burnt offering.</b> Accordingly, this verse <b>teaches about</b> every <b>obligatory burnt offering,</b> including the burnt offering of appearance, <b>that it requires placing hands,</b> just as a voluntary burnt offering does. |
| Leviticus 9:17 | with regard to the removal of a handful, | Menachot 10a:6 | <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The verses that specify that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe do not teach a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a leper, as it is clear that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe, as it states: “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering.” Rather, these verses are the source of verbal analogies for other <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states with regard to a wealthy leper: “Of his right hand” (Leviticus 14:17), this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“hand”</b> written here and <b>“hand”</b> written <b>with regard to the removal of a handful,</b> as the verse states about the removal of a handful: “And he filled his hand from it” (Leviticus 9:17). The verbal analogy teaches that the removal of the handful must also be performed with the right hand. |
| Leviticus 9:17 | “And he presented the meal offering; and he filled his hand from it” | Menachot 19b:4 | <b>Rav holds</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> of using one’s hand and not a utensil is <b>also repeated</b> in another <b>verse, as it is written</b> in the context of Aaron’s service on the eighth day of the consecration of the Tabernacle: <b>“And he presented the meal offering; and he filled his hand from it”</b> (Leviticus 9:17), demonstrating that the handful is removed by hand and not with a utensil. <b>And Shmuel</b> holds that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> for all <b>generations from a temporary</b> situation. Therefore, using one’s hand is not indispensable, as the general requirements of the rites of the meal offering cannot be derived from a verse referring to the meal offering that was sacrificed during the consecration of the Tabernacle. |
| Leviticus 9:17 | the verse states: “And the meal offering was presented; and he filled his hand from it” | Menachot 9b:17 | § The mishna teaches: If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is unfit. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And the meal offering was presented; and he filled his hand from it”</b> (Leviticus 9:17). Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>This hand, I do not know what it is,</b> i.e., the left hand or the right. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the atonement of a leper: <b>“And the priest shall take of the <i>log</i> of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand”</b> (Leviticus 14:15), it mentions the left hand. One can therefore derive that <b>here,</b> where the verse specifies, the priest must use his <b>left</b> hand, whereas in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in a verse <b>“hand”</b> without specification, it is referring <b>only</b> to the <b>right</b> hand. |
| Leviticus 9:20 | But isn’t it written: “And they put the fat upon the breasts” | Menachot 62a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And they put the fat upon the breasts”</b> (Leviticus 9:20), which also indicates that the fat is to be on top of, not beneath, the breast and thigh? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring to the stage <b>when</b> the priest who waved them <b>gives them to another priest,</b> who brings the sacrificial portions up to the altar. Once again the parts are turned over in this exchange, so that the sacrificial fats are on top of the breast. <b>And</b> this third priest then <b>goes and burns</b> the sacrificial portions on the altar. |
| Leviticus 9:22 | thanksgiving? As it is written: “And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from sacrificing the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings” | Megillah 18a:3 | <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says the Priestly Benediction after</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving? As it is written: “And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from sacrificing the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 9:22), teaching that the Priestly Benediction follows the sacrificial service, which includes the thanks-offering. |
| Leviticus 9:22 | Rabbi Yehuda says: Even the High Priest lifts his hands above the frontplate, as it is stated: “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them” | Sotah 38a:1 | <b>as it is written</b> in the Torah, i.e., the Tetragrammaton, <b>and in the country</b> they use <b>its substitute name</b> of Lordship. <b>In the country, the priests lift their hands</b> so they are <b>aligned with their shoulders</b> during the benediction. <b>And in the Temple</b> they lift them <b>above their heads, except for the High Priest, who does not lift his hands above the frontplate.</b> Since the Tetragrammaton is inscribed on it, it is inappropriate for him to lift his hands above it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even the High Priest lifts his hands above the frontplate, as it is stated: “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them”</b> (Leviticus 9:22). |
| Leviticus 9:22 | “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them” | Sotah 38a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless”</b> means <b>with lifted hands.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the priests must recite the benediction <b>with lifted hands, or</b> perhaps they may recite it <b>without lifted hands? It is stated here: “So you shall bless,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <b>“And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them”</b> (Leviticus 9:22). <b>Just as there,</b> Aaron blessed the nation <b>with lifted hands, so too here,</b> the Priestly Benediction is recited <b>with lifted hands.</b> |
| Leviticus 9:22 | as it is stated: “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings” | Sotah 38b:7 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Any priest who does not ascend</b> the platform <b>during</b> the blessing of <b>the</b> Temple <b>service</b> recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer <b>may no longer ascend</b> to recite the benediction, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 9:22). <b>Just as there,</b> in the Tabernacle, Aaron lifted up his hands <b>during the service,</b> as evident from the fact that only after he blessed them does it say that he came down from sacrificing the offerings, <b>so too here,</b> in the <i>Amida</i> prayer, the Priestly Benediction is recited <b>during</b> the blessing of Temple <b>service.</b> |
| Leviticus 9:22 | “And Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them” | Tamid 33b:5 | Furthermore, <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country,</b> while reciting the Priestly Benediction <b>the priests lift their hands opposite their shoulders, and in the Temple</b> they raise them <b>above their heads.</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all priests in the Temple, <b>except for</b> the <b>High Priest, who does not raise his hands above the frontplate</b> on his forehead, as the name of God is written on the frontplate. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> the <b>High Priest</b> would <b>raise his hands above the frontplate</b> while reciting the Priestly Benediction in the Temple, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Priestly Benediction recited by Aaron the High Priest: <b>“And Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them”</b> (Leviticus 9:22). |
| Leviticus 10:2 | and they died before the Lord” | Sanhedrin 52a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does the one who derives</b> that burning means this kind of death <b>from the sons of Aaron</b> derive that their bodies were not burned? The Gemara answers: He derives it from that <b>which is written:</b> “And fire came out from before the Lord, and devoured them, <b>and they died before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 10:2). The term “and they died” indicates that it was <b>similar to</b> a natural <b>death,</b> in which the body remains intact. |
| Leviticus 10:3 | This is it that the Lord spoke, saying: Through them that are near to Me I will be sanctified… | Zevachim 115b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the command for the priests to sanctify themselves is referring to <b>the separation of Nadav and Avihu, this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> after their death on the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “Then Moses said to Aaron: <b>This is it that the Lord spoke, saying: Through them that are near to Me I will be sanctified…</b>and Aaron held his peace” (Leviticus 10:3). Nadav and Avihu had already been warned not to draw too close: “Lest the Lord break forth upon them.” |
| Leviticus 10:6 | the Merciful One states to the sons of Aaron: “Let not the hair of your heads go loose” | Moed Katan14b:21 | § The source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>it is prohibited for a mourner to</b> receive <b>a haircut is</b> derived <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One states to the sons of Aaron: “Let not the hair of your heads go loose”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). It was prohibited for them to let their hair grow long during their period of mourning over the death of their brothers, Nadav and Avihu. <b>By inference,</b> it is teaching <b>that for everyone</b> else, i.e., non-priests, <b>it is prohibited</b> to cut their hair during the period of mourning. |
| Leviticus 10:6 | that the Merciful One says to the sons of Aaron: “Neither rend | Moed Katan15a:22 | The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is obligated to rend</b> his clothes. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to the sons of Aaron: “Neither rend</b> your clothes” (Leviticus 10:6), which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else, all other mourners, <b>are obligated</b> to rend their clothes. |
| Leviticus 10:6 | it is written: “Let the hair of your heads not grow loose [ tifra’u ]” | Moed Katan19b:8 | § The Gemara asks now about the thirty-day mourning period: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <b>thirty-day</b> period of mourning? The Gemara answers: <b>It is learned</b> by way of a verbal analogy <b>between</b> one instance of the word <b><i>pera</i></b> and a different instance of the word <b><i>pera</i></b> stated with regard to <b>a nazirite. Here,</b> in the instructions given to Aaron not to mourn the deaths of his sons, <b>it is written: “Let the hair of your heads not grow loose [<i>tifra’u</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:6), which indicates that ordinary mourners are required to grow their hair long. <b>And there,</b> with regard to a nazirite, <b>it is written: “He shall let the hair of his head grow long [<i>pera</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:5). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the nazirite, he must grow his hair for <b>thirty</b> days, <b>so too, here</b> a mourner must grow his hair for <b>thirty</b> days. |
| Leviticus 10:6 | “Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes, that you not die” | Moed Katan24a:3 | <b>And if you heard</b> a statement on this issue <b>in the name of Shmuel,</b> then <b>you heard as follows: Rav Taḥlifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: A mourner who did not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild and did not rend</b> his garments <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated</b> following the deaths of Nadab and Abihu concerning the surviving sons of Aaron: <b>“Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes, that you not die”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). They were instructed not to mourn, so as not to interfere with the dedication of the Tabernacle. From here it may be deduced <b>that</b> any <b>other</b> mourner <b>who did not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild or rend</b> his clothes <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:6 | “But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the Lord has kindled” | Moed Katan28b:13 | Having been granted permission to speak, <b>Rabbi Tarfon answered and said:</b> With regard to the death of Aaron’s sons it says: <b>“But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the Lord has kindled”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Nadav and Avihu, who had performed only one mitzva</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him”</b> (Leviticus 9:9), <b>this</b> was nevertheless stated about them, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who were well known for their performance of many mitzvot, <b>all the more so</b> should the entire Jewish people bewail their death. |
| Leviticus 10:6 | as it is stated: “And Moses said to Aaron, and to Elazar and to Itamar, | Taanit 15b:13 | The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> which provides the sources for this principle. With regard to matters <b>of greatness one begins with the greatest</b> member, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses said to Aaron, and to Elazar and to Itamar,</b> his sons” (Leviticus 10:6). Moses first addresses the most important person, Aaron, and this was a matter of distinction, as the verse continues: “For the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you” (Leviticus 10:7). <b>And</b> for any matter <b>involving a curse, one begins with the least</b> important member of a group, <b>as the serpent was cursed first, and afterward Eve was cursed and afterward Adam was cursed.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:9 | “Drink no wine nor strong drink, you nor your sons with you, when you come into | Bava Metzia90b:10 | Rabbi Simai <b>said to him: You</b> can <b>learn from your father’s house,</b> i.e., you can derive this <i>halakha</i> from the case of priests, being a priest yourself. As the Torah states: <b>“Drink no wine nor strong drink, you nor your sons with you, when you come into</b> the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 10:9). Doesn’t a straightforward reading of this verse lead to the conclusion that <b>it is</b> only <b>when you come into</b> the Sanctuary <b>that it is prohibited,</b> whereas <b>to drink</b> wine <b>and</b> then <b>enter is permitted?</b> |
| Leviticus 10:9 | liable | Bekhorot 45b:10 | The Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case where one became drunk <b>through other intoxicating agents,</b> not through wine. In such a case, the rites are not profaned. <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that even in such a case the rites are profaned, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda says that a priest who <b>ate</b> pressed <b>figs from Ke’ila or drank milk or honey,</b> thereby becoming intoxicated, and <b>entered the Sanctuary</b> to serve, is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes. This is because he transgressed the prohibition: “Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 10:9). He understands that “strong drink” means any intoxicating agent. The verse indicates that one who performs the Temple service while drunk profanes the service, as it states immediately afterward: “And that you may put difference between the holy and the common.” |
| Leviticus 10:9 | “Drink no wine nor intoxicating drink, | Keritot 13b:6 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If one interrupted his drinking of the quarter-<i>log</i> of wine, or if he placed any amount of water into the wine, he is exempt. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the Torah instructs Aaron the High Priest: <b>“Drink no wine nor intoxicating drink,</b> you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you shall not die” (Leviticus 10:9), one <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if he drank <b>any amount,</b> and <b>even</b> if he drank wine <b>from its press,</b> i.e., wine that has not finished fermenting. |
| Leviticus 10:9 | “Do not drink wine or strong drink, you nor your sons with you, | Nazir 4a:4 | The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> could respond to this argument as follows: <b>This is the reason that</b> the verse <b>writes “strong drink”:</b> It is <b>to teach</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“strong drink”</b> written here and <b>“strong drink”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> entering and performing service in <b>the Temple, as it is written</b> that Aaron the priest was commanded: <b>“Do not drink wine or strong drink, you nor your sons with you,</b> when you go into the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 10:9). This teaches: <b>Just as with a nazirite, it is wine</b> alone <b>that is forbidden but other beverages</b> are <b>not</b> forbidden, <b>so too, with regard to</b> the <b>Temple, it is wine that is forbidden</b> to priests, <b>but other intoxicating beverages</b> are <b>not</b> forbidden to them. |
| Leviticus 10:9 | that you not die; | Sanhedrin 22b:16 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> priests entering the Temple <b>drunk on wine</b> are liable for death, <b>as it is written: “Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you,</b> when you go into the Tent of Meeting, <b>that you not die;</b> it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations” (Leviticus 10:9). <b>But</b> as for priests <b>with long hair, from where do we</b> derive that they are punished with death at the hand of Heaven? |
| Leviticus 10:9 | as it is written: “Drink no wine nor strong drink, | Sanhedrin 83b:17 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the punishment for priests who performed the Temple service while <b>intoxicated with wine</b> is death at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is written: “Drink no wine nor strong drink,</b> you and your sons with you, when you come into the Tent of Meeting, that you shall not die” (Leviticus 10:9). |
| Leviticus 10:9 | explicitly written: “Drink no wine nor strong drink, | Taanit 17b:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And these</b> are the transgressors who are punished <b>by death</b> at the hand of Heaven: Priests who enter the Temple to serve <b>who have drunk wine, and those</b> priests <b>who have long hair</b> while they serve. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, those who have drunk wine</b> are punished by death, as it is <b>explicitly written: “Drink no wine nor strong drink,</b> neither you nor your sons with you, when you enter the Tent of Meeting, that you should not die” (Leviticus 10:9). <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>those</b> priests <b>who have long hair, from where do we</b> derive that they are punishable by death? |
| Leviticus 10:9 | is liable | Yoma 76b:1 | <b>is liable</b> for violating the prohibition: “Drink no wine nor strong drink [<i>sheikhar</i>]” (Leviticus 10:9). Consequently, the term <i>sheikhar</i> in the text can be understood here as the sweet dried fig. |
| Leviticus 10:10 | the Merciful One states: “That you may make a difference between the sacred and the non-sacred” | Bava Metzia90b:11 | This interpretation is not tenable, as with regard to the same matter <b>the Merciful One states: “That you may make a difference between the sacred and the non-sacred”</b> (Leviticus 10:10), which indicates that the priest must be capable of making these distinctions when he enters the Temple. <b>Rather, just as there,</b> with regard to the prohibition against drinking wine in the Sanctuary, the Torah means that <b>at the time of entry there must be no drunkenness,</b> whether the wine was drunk inside or outside the Sanctuary, <b>here too</b> it means that <b>at the time of threshing there must be no muzzling.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:10 | will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the holy and the unholy, | Shevuot 18b:10 | The Gemara continues to expound these verses: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> and not over some other beverage, <b>will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the holy and the unholy,</b> and between the impure and the pure” (Leviticus 10:10), <b>and it is written there</b> once again: <b>“To distinguish between the impure and the pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:47), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive</b> and bear a male child” (Leviticus 12:2). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>will have sons who are worthy of teaching</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is written: “To distinguish</b> between the holy and the unholy…<b>and to teach”</b> (Leviticus 10:10–11). |
| Leviticus 10:10 | “That you may put difference between | Zevachim 18a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the <i>tanna</i></b> of the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> <b>derive</b> that the rites of those who drank wine are disqualified from the verse: <b>“That you may put difference between</b> the holy and the common” (Leviticus 10:10), and not by verbal analogy to a priest lacking the requisite vestments? The Gemara responds: “That you may put difference between the holy and the common” is the source of this <i>halakha</i> only <b>before</b> the <b>verbal analogy stands.</b> Once the verbal analogy is derived, it is the source of the <i>halakha</i> with regard to those who drank wine as well. |
| Leviticus 10:12 | honor, one begins with the greatest, as it is written: “And Moses said unto Aaron, and Elazar and Itamar, his remaining sons: Take | Berakhot 61a:10 | The Gemara explains: <b>In</b> conferring <b>honor, one begins with the greatest, as it is written: “And Moses said unto Aaron, and Elazar and Itamar, his remaining sons: Take</b> the meal-offering that remains” (Leviticus 10:12). Aaron, who was the greatest among those involved, is mentioned first. And <b>in cursing, one begins with the least significant,</b> as <b>first</b> the <b>snake was cursed, then Eve was cursed, and ultimately Adam</b> himself <b>was cursed.</b> The punishment did not begin with Adam. |
| Leviticus 10:12 | “unleavened” | Yevamot 40a:9 | The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> possibility of eating the meal-offering <b>boiled, what are the circumstances,</b> i.e., how is it classified? <b>If it is</b> considered to be <b>unleavened</b> because it is presumed that the flour never managed to rise before it was cooked, <b>then it is unleavened</b> and there is no reason to prohibit its use; <b>and if it is not</b> considered to be <b>unleavened</b> because it is presumed that the flour managed to rise before it was cooked, then it is certainly disqualified from use because <b>the Merciful One states</b> that the offering must be <b>“unleavened”</b> (Leviticus 10:12). How, then, could one ever have questioned whether it is permitted to eat the meal-offering if it was boiled? |
| Leviticus 10:12 | and eat it without leaven beside the altar; | Zevachim 60a:13 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the case of <b>an altar that was damaged, one may not eat the remainder of a meal offering on its account, as it is stated:</b> “Take the meal offering…<b>and eat it without leaven beside the altar;</b> for it is most holy” (Leviticus 10:12). The verse is difficult: <b>But did</b> the priests have to <b>eat</b> the meal offering <b>beside the altar?</b> A priest may eat sacrificial items even of the most sacred order anywhere in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rather,</b> the verse means that one may eat the meal offering only <b>at a time when</b> the altar <b>is complete, but not at a time when it is lacking.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:13 | “For so I am commanded [ tzuveiti ]” | Zevachim 101a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, on which two of Aaron’s sons died, Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons using three different forms of the word command: <b>“For so I am commanded [<i>tzuveiti</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:13), <b>“as I commanded [<i>tziveiti</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:18), and <b>“as the Lord has commanded [<i>tziva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:15). Moses said to Aaron: “And you shall eat it…<b>for so I am commanded,”</b> to teach that Aaron and his remaining sons <b>shall partake of</b> the offerings even <b>in acute mourning.</b> The statement: “You should certainly have eaten it…<b>as I commanded,”</b> Moses <b>said to them at the time of</b> the <b>incident,</b> when Aaron and his sons burned the sin offering for the New Moon. Moses said: <b>“As the Lord has commanded,”</b> to emphasize that it is <b>not of my own</b> initiative that <b>I say</b> this, but it is from the word of God. |
| Leviticus 10:13 | “And you shall eat it in a sacred place” | Zevachim 55a:13 | <b>Abaye says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering: <b>“And you shall eat it in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 10:13). The word “it” is a restriction, teaching that one must eat <b>“it,”</b> i.e., the meal offering, <b>in a sacred place,</b> i.e., in the camp of the Divine Presence, <b>but</b> one is <b>not</b> required to eat <b>another</b> offering, i.e., the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving, <b>in a sacred place.</b> This <b>removes</b> the portions from the camp of the Divine Presence, <b>to</b> be eaten in <b>the Levites’ camp. Then it is written:</b> “You shall eat <b>in a pure place,”</b> which <b>removes</b> the portions from the Levites’ camp, <b>to</b> be eaten in <b>the Israelites’ camp.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:14 | not, | Bekhorot 32b:11 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai? As it is written</b> in a verse discussing the firstborn offering, addressed to Aaron and his sons: “But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy …<b>and their flesh shall be yours,</b> as the wave breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours” (Numbers 18:17–18). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the breast and the thigh, <b>priests may</b> partake of it but <b>an Israelite,</b> i.e., a non-priest, may <b>not,</b> as the verse states: “You shall eat in a pure place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you” (Leviticus 10:14), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the firstborn offering, only <b>priests may</b> partake of it, but <b>an Israelite</b> may <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:14 | “And the breast of waving and the hind leg of heaving you shall eat…you, and your sons and your daughters with you” | Yevamot 87a:9 | <b>And Rava said:</b> It states: <b>“And the breast of waving and the hind leg of heaving you shall eat…you, and your sons and your daughters with you”</b> (Leviticus 10:14). This indicates that daughters of priests may eat <b>at a time when</b> they are <b>“with you,”</b> but once they have left the priest’s domain, e.g., by marrying an ordinary Israelite, they may no longer partake of these gifts even if they subsequently return to his household. |
| Leviticus 10:14 | “And the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving you shall eat in a pure place; | Zevachim 55a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the priests: <b>“And the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving you shall eat in a pure place;</b> you, and your sons, and your daughters with you; for they are given as your due, and your sons’ due, out of the peace offerings of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 10:14). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said: But did they eat</b> the <b>first</b> offerings, mentioned in the previous two verses, <b>in</b> a place of <b>impurity?</b> The previous verses make reference to the remainder of the meal offering, which also had to be eaten in a pure place. |
| Leviticus 10:15 | and the first fruits, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov; and the sacrificial portions of the peace offerings of an individual and their breast and thigh, | Menachot 61a:5 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> are the items that <b>require waving and do not require bringing near</b> to the altar: <b>The <i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper and his guilt offering</b> itself, as it is written: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12); <b>and the first fruits, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov; and the sacrificial portions of the peace offerings of an individual and their breast and thigh,</b> as it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the portions consumed by fire, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15). |
| Leviticus 10:15 | because it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving they shall bring upon the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave offering | Menachot 62a:3 | The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., from where is it learned, that the sacrificial portions should be placed on the bottom, and the breast and thigh on top of them? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving they shall bring upon the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave offering</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15), which indicates that the breast and thigh are placed on top of the fats, that is insufficient: <b>But isn’t it written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The fat upon the breast he shall bring,</b> that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30)? That verse leads to the opposite conclusion, as it indicates that the fats are to be placed on top of the breast. |
| Leviticus 10:15 | “as God has commanded” | Yoma 5b:3 | Apropos that phrase, the Gemara cites a related halakhic midrash. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the context of the implementation of the inauguration, three variations of the phrase appear: <b>“For so I am commanded”</b> (Leviticus 8:35); <b>“as I commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:18); and <b>“as God has commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:15). What does this repetition teach? From the phrase: <b>“For so I am commanded,”</b> it is derived that even in a state of <b>acute mourning,</b> on the first day after the death of a relative, one must <b>eat</b> the offering. God stated the verse: <b>“As I commanded,” at the time of the incident</b> just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning. And when Moses states: <b>“As God commanded,”</b> he is saying: The command is from God <b>and</b> it is <b>not from my</b> own initiative that <b>I am saying</b> it. |
| Leviticus 10:15 | “as the Lord has commanded [ tziva ]” | Zevachim 101a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, on which two of Aaron’s sons died, Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons using three different forms of the word command: <b>“For so I am commanded [<i>tzuveiti</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:13), <b>“as I commanded [<i>tziveiti</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:18), and <b>“as the Lord has commanded [<i>tziva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:15).

| Leviticus 10:16 | “Diligently inquired [ darosh darash ]” | Kiddushin 30a:11 | <b>Therefore,</b> because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the <b>first</b> Sages <b>were called: Those who count [<i>soferim</i>],</b> because <b>they would count all the letters in the Torah, as they would say</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:42) <b>is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll.</b> The words: <b>“Diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), <b>are the midpoint of the words</b> in a Torah scroll. And the verse that begins with: <b>“Then he shall be shaven”</b> (Leviticus 13:33), is the midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>verses.</b> Similarly, in the expression: <b>“The boar out of the wood [<i>miya’ar</i>] ravages it”</b> (Psalms 80:14), <b>the <i>ayin</i> in</b> the word wood <b>[<i>ya’ar</i>]</b> is the <b>midpoint of Psalms,</b> with regard to its number of letters.

| Leviticus 10:16 | and, behold, it was burnt” | Pesachim 23b:13 | <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “It shall be burnt with fire”; And</b> for <b>what</b> purpose then does <b>the verse state: “It shall be burnt with fire”?

| Leviticus 10:16 | who were left” | Yoma 87a:4 | They said: <b>Fortunate are the righteous</b> because <b>not only do they</b> accumulate <b>merit</b> for themselves, <b>but they</b> accumulate <b>merit for their children and their children’s children until the end of all generations; as there were several sons of Aaron who</b> essentially <b>deserved to be burned like Nadav and Avihu, as it is stated:</b> “The sons of Aaron <b>who were left”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), implying that others were left as well although they deserved to be burned with their brothers. <b>But the merit of their father protected them,</b> and they and their descendants were priests for all time. |
| Leviticus 10:16 | “And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin offering, | Zevachim 101b:6 | The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin offering,</b> and behold, it was burned” (Leviticus 10:16). When the verse states: “The <b>goat,” this</b> is referring to <b>the goat of Nahshon,</b> son of Amminadav, the prince of the tribe of Judah, who brought the offering on the first day of the Tabernacle’s inauguration (see Numbers 7:12). When the verse states: “The <b>sin offering,” this</b> is referring to the <b>sin offering</b> that the people brought on the <b>eighth</b> day of the inauguration (see Leviticus 9:13). The term <b>“inquired”</b> is referring to the <b>goat</b> sacrificed at every <b>New Moon</b> (see Numbers 28:15). The Tabernacle was erected on the New Moon of Nisan (see Exodus 40:17). These are the three goats that were sacrificed that day. |
| Leviticus 10:17 | and it is written with regard to a sin offering: “And He has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation” | Menachot 4a:8 | Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You are saying well,</b> as <b>it is written with regard to</b> a meal offering of jealousy: <b>“Bringing iniquity to remembrance”</b> (Numbers 5:15), <b>and it is written with regard to a sin offering: “And He has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17). A verbal analogy is drawn between the two uses of the term “iniquity” in these verses. This teaches that <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>a sin offering, its surplus</b> is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering of jealousy, its surplus</b> is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings. <b>And</b> a meal offering of jealousy is also <b>like a sin offering</b> in another aspect: <b>Just as a sin offering is disqualified</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, so too, a meal offering of jealousy is disqualified</b> when a handful is removed from it <b>not for its own sake.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:17 | iniquity [ avon ] | Menachot 4a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering of jealousy is derived from a verbal analogy to a sin offering based on the word “iniquity,” then <b>a guilt offering should</b> also <b>be disqualified</b> if it was sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, as</b> a similar verbal analogy may be <b>derived from</b> the verse that states: “The <b>iniquity [<i>avon</i>]</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> and the verse that states: “And shall bear his <b>iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), in connection with a guilt offering. |
| Leviticus 10:17 | the sin-offering of Aaron, | Pesachim 82b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Let us</b> instead <b>learn</b> the rules of <i>piggul</i> <b>through</b> a verbal analogy based on the parallel words <b>“iniquity”</b> and <b>“iniquity”</b> from <b>the sin-offering of Aaron,</b> with regard to which the verse states: “Why did you not eat the sin-offering in the place of sanctity…and He gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17). The sin-offering of Aaron was burned immediately, without decay of form, so why can it not be learned from there that <i>piggul</i> does not require decay of form either? That <i>tanna</i> could have <b>said to you: The sin-offering of Aaron in a case like this would also require decay of form</b> were it to occur <b>in</b> future <b>generations; but there,</b> when it was burned immediately, <b>it was a provisional edict</b> issued in exigent circumstances. |
| Leviticus 10:17 | sin | Shevuot 10a:19 | The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons do not atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of Festivals</b> atone, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “And he gave it to you to bear the <b>sin</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, <b>one sin but does not bear two sins. But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of New Moons atone.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states:</b> “He gave <b>it</b> to you.” The emphasis on “it” teaches that <b>it bears</b> this <b>sin, but no other</b> offering <b>bears</b> this <b>sin.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:17 | the sin | Shevuot 10b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons that they do not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to any one of the goats of the New Moons: “And He gave it to you to bear <b>the sin</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), which teaches that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, <b>one sin but does not bear two sins.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals should also not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> atone, <b>as</b> that same <b>verse states:</b> “And He gave <b>it</b> to you,” which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, that <b>sin, but nothing</b> else <b>bears</b> that <b>sin.</b> Why then does Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda cite Rabbi Shimon as holding that the goats of the Festivals do atone for that which the goats of the New Moons atone? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon <b>does not learn</b> anything from the word <b>“it.”</b> Accordingly, he holds that any one of the goats of the Festivals can atone for two different sins. |
| Leviticus 10:17 | Rabbi Oshaya says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states: “And He gave it to you to bear the sin of the congregation” | Shevuot 9b:6 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states: “And He gave it to you to bear the sin of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), <b>and this verse is written with regard to</b> the <b>goat of</b> the <b>New Moon. And</b> its capacity to atone <b>is derived from the frontplate</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“sin”</b> in this verse, and the word <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to the frontplate. The verse there states: “And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead and Aaron will bear the sin of the sacred offerings” (Exodus 28:38). The verbal analogy teaches as follows: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: <b>“Sin,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the frontplate: <b>“Sin.” Just as there,</b> in the verse in Exodus, the atonement is for a sin involving the <b>ritual impurity of</b> sacrificial <b>meat,</b> i.e., where such meat is placed on the altar, <b>so too here,</b> in the verse in Leviticus, the atonement is for a sin involving the <b>ritual impurity of</b> sacrificial <b>meat,</b> i.e., where a ritually pure person partakes of it. |
| Leviticus 10:17 | “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the Sanctuary?” | Zevachim 101a:13 | The Gemara continues: <b>And how</b> would <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> who hold that the sin offering was burned due to ritual impurity, <b>reconcile those</b> verses? <b>They</b> would <b>reconcile them like this:</b> When Moses said to Aaron and his sons: <b>“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the Sanctuary?”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), he meant: <b>Perhaps its blood entered the innermost sanctum,</b> disqualifying the offering. Aaron <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>“Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the Sanctuary within”</b> (Leviticus 10:18). |
| Leviticus 10:17 | “Why have you not eaten | Zevachim 101a:8 | <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> would <b>reconcile them like this:</b> When Moses asked: <b>“Why have you not eaten</b> the sin offering?” (Leviticus 10:17), this is what <b>Moses said to Aaron: Perhaps the blood of</b> this sin offering <b>entered the innermost sanctum,</b> thereby disqualifying it (see Leviticus 6:23). Is this why you burned it? Aaron <b>said to him: “Behold, the blood of it was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within” (Leviticus 10:18). Moses then asked: <b>Perhaps it went outside its partition,</b> i.e., it exited the courtyard of the Tabernacle, and was thereby disqualified? Aaron <b>said to him: It was inside the sacred</b> area at all times. |
| Leviticus 10:17 | “And He has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation” | Zevachim 101b:7 | One <b>might</b> have thought that all <b>three of them were burned.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin offering, <b>and, behold, it was burned,”</b> to teach that <b>one</b> of the offerings <b>was burned, but not</b> all <b>three of them were burned.</b> The verse states: “And Moses <b>diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>].” Why</b> were there <b>two inquiries?</b> Moses <b>said to them: For what</b> reason is <b>this sin offering burned, and</b> secondly, for what reason are <b>those left</b> unburned? The <i>baraita</i> comments: Still, <b>I do not know which of them</b> was burned. <b>When it states</b> with regard to the burned goat: <b>“And He has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), <b>you must say: This is the goat of the New Moon,</b> which atones for impurity in the Temple. |
| Leviticus 10:18 | as it is written: “Behold, its blood was not brought into the Sanctuary within; | Pesachim 82a:13 | The Gemara responds: It is derived from the verses describing Moses admonishing Aaron and his sons about the fact that they did not eat the sin-offering on the eighth day of inauguration, <b>as it is written: “Behold, its blood was not brought into the Sanctuary within;</b> you should have eaten it in the Sanctuary, as I commanded” (Leviticus 10:18). This should be understood as follows: <b>Moses said to Aaron: Why didn’t you eat the sin-offering? Perhaps its blood entered the innermost</b> chamber, the Sanctuary, in which case it must be burned? Aaron <b>said to him: No.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:18 | “Behold, its blood was not brought into the Sanctuary within” | Pesachim 83a:2 | The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: If you expound the verse in this fashion, then with regard to a regular <b>sin-offering whose blood entered inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>from where</b> is it derived that it must be burned? <b>He said to them:</b> It is derived from the verse: <b>“Behold, its blood was not brought into the Sanctuary within”</b> (Leviticus 10:18). This proves <b>by inference that if</b> the sin-offering <b>is taken out</b> of its permitted area, <b>or alternatively,</b> if <b>its blood enters</b> the Sanctuary, it must be <b>burned</b> immediately without waiting for decay of form. |
| Leviticus 10:18 | “as I commanded” | Yoma 5b:3 | Apropos that phrase, the Gemara cites a related halakhic midrash. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the context of the implementation of the inauguration, three variations of the phrase appear: <b>“For so I am commanded”</b> (Leviticus 8:35); <b>“as I commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:18); and <b>“as God has commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:15). What does this repetition teach? From the phrase: <b>“For so I am commanded,”</b> it is derived that even in a state of <b>acute mourning,</b> on the first day after the death of a relative, one must <b>eat</b> the offering. God stated the verse: <b>“As I commanded,” at the time of the incident</b> just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning.

Is this why you burned it? Aaron <b>said to him: “Behold, the blood of it was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within” (Leviticus 10:18). Moses then asked: <b>Perhaps it went outside its partition,</b> i.e., it exited the courtyard of the Tabernacle, and was thereby disqualified? Aaron <b>said to him: It was inside the sacred</b> area at all times. |
| Leviticus 10:18 | as I commanded” | Zevachim 101a:9 | Moses then suggested: <b>But perhaps you sacrificed it in acute mourning,</b> which is prohibited for ordinary priests, <b>and disqualified it.</b> Aaron <b>said to him: Moses, was it they,</b> i.e., my sons, <b>who sacrificed</b> the offering? <b>I sacrificed</b> the offering, and as High Priest, I may serve even as an acute mourner (see Leviticus 21:10–12). <b>And</b> Moses <b>said to him: “Behold, the blood of it was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within,” <b>and it was inside the sacred</b> area at all times; therefore: <b>“You should certainly have consumed it</b> in the sacred area, <b>as I commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:18), i.e., just as I commanded that the priests should <b>consume</b> today’s meal offering <b>in acute mourning.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:18 | “Behold, its blood was not brought | Zevachim 82a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: If you expound the verse in this fashion, then <b>from where</b> is it derived that a standard <b>sin offering whose blood entered the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies, must be burned? Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>said to them</b> that it is derived from the verse: <b>“Behold, its blood was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within” (Leviticus 10:18). This indicates that had the sin offering referred to in the verse been brought inside the Sanctuary, it should have been burned. In any event, with regard to the issue at hand, since Rabbi Yosei HaGelili interprets the verse from Leviticus 6:23 in this manner, how can he interpret it differently in his dispute with Rabbi Akiva? |
| Leviticus 10:18 | “Into the sacred place within” | Zevachim 82b:17 | Rava explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that since the verse states: <b>“Into the sacred place within”</b> (Leviticus 10:18) as a single phrase, and therefore <b>anywhere that we read</b> a prohibition against bringing the blood <b>“into the sacred place,”</b> i.e., that the blood is disqualified by being brought into the Sanctuary, <b>we</b> also <b>read</b> a prohibition against bringing the blood <b>“within,”</b> i.e., that it is likewise disqualified when it is brought into the Holy of Holies; but <b>anywhere that we do not read</b> a prohibition against bringing the blood <b>“into the sacred place,”</b> such as with regard to these offerings, whose blood is supposed to be brought into the Sanctuary, <b>we do not read</b> a prohibition against bringing the blood <b>“within”</b> the Holy of Holies? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since in any event the Holy of Holies <b>is not the</b> proper <b>place</b> for the blood <b>of these</b> offerings, it is disqualified. |
| Leviticus 10:18 | within” | Zevachim 82b:9 | § The Gemara returns to its discussion of the blood of a sin offer-ing that entered the Sanctuary. <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is stated that when Moses questioned Aaron as to why a sin offering was not consumed, he said: “Behold, its blood was not brought into the sacred place <b>within”</b> (Leviticus 10:18). This indicates that had the blood been brought within, Moses would have understood that the offering would have been disqualified and rendered prohibited for consumption. The <i>baraita</i> comments: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the offering is disqualified if the blood is brought <b>within,</b> i.e., into the Holy of Holies; <b>from where</b> is it derived that the same applies if it was merely brought into the <b>Sanctuary? The verse states: “Into the sacred place within,”</b> and this sacred place is the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 10:19 | as these | Pesachim 82b:17 | With regard to <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, what is</b> the ruling in which he expressed his opinion? It is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> Aaron’s sin-offering that was burned on the eighth day of inauguration <b>was burned due to acute mourning,</b> as that was the day his sons Nadav and Avihu died. <b>For this</b> reason, <b>it is stated</b> that Aaron explained to Moses: “Now that events such <b>as these</b> befell me, were I to eat this day’s sin-offering would the Lord approve?” (Leviticus 10:19). In other words, it was due to the deaths of his sons, which Aaron referred as “events such as these,” that Aaron burned the sin-offering instead of eating it. |
| Leviticus 10:19 | “Behold, | Zevachim 100b:18 | The Gemara objects: <b>And does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>hold</b> that <b>acute mourning at night is by Torah law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On the last day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, after two of Aaron’s sons died, Aaron said to Moses: <b>“Behold,</b> today…there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had consumed the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?” (Leviticus 10:19). The word “today” teaches that Aaron is saying: <b>I am prohibited</b> from partaking <b>today but permitted</b> to partake at <b>night; but for</b> future <b>generations,</b> an acute mourner is <b>prohibited</b> from partaking of sacrificial meat <b>whether during the day or at night.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> For future generations, <b>acute mourning at night is not by Torah law,</b> but <b>rather by rabbinic law.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:19 | and there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had consumed the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?” | Zevachim 101a:10 | Aaron <b>said to him:</b> “Behold, today have they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, <b>and there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had consumed the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?”</b> (Leviticus 10:19). <b>Perhaps you heard</b> the command to consume the offering <b>only with regard to offerings of</b> a particular <b>time,</b> i.e., the meal offering, which was unique to that day. |
| Leviticus 10:19 | consecrated to Heaven with contempt? “There have befallen me such things as these” | Zevachim 101a:15 | Moses then asked: <b>Or perhaps, due to your bitterness</b> in mourning, <b>were you neglectful of</b> the offering <b>and it became impure?</b> Aaron <b>said to him: Moses, am I in your eyes such</b> a person, <b>that I</b> would <b>treat</b> an offering <b>consecrated to Heaven with contempt? “There have befallen me such things as these”</b> (Leviticus 10:19), i.e., <b>even</b> if <b>these</b> tragedies <b>and</b> more <b>such as them</b> should befall me, <b>I</b> would <b>not treat</b> an offering <b>consecrated to Heaven with contempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:19 | as these; | Zevachim 101a:3 | <b>And</b> the Sages <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The sin offering <b>was burned due to</b> the <b>acute mourning</b> of Aaron and his sons, since they felt they could not partake of it. <b>Therefore,</b> it <b>is stated</b> in Aaron’s explanation: “There have befallen me such things <b>as these;</b> and if I had consumed the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?” (Leviticus 10:19). Moses conceded to Aaron that he was correct (see Leviticus 10:20), indicating that it was not permitted for Aaron to partake of the sin offering in acute mourning. |
| Leviticus 10:19 | they offered | Zevachim 16a:15 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> One can derive it <b>from here</b> instead: When Moses asked Aaron why the sin offering that was sacrificed on the day that Nadav and Avihu died was burned and not eaten, he suspected that Aaron’s other sons, Eleazar and Itamar, had sacrificed the sin offering while acute mourners, which disqualified it and forced them to burn it. Aaron responded to Moses: “This day have <b>they offered</b> their sin offering?” (Leviticus 10:19). Rather, <b>I offered</b> it. As High Priest, I do not desecrate the Temple service even when I am an acute mourner; I burned it only because, as acute mourners, my sons and I are prohibited from partaking of the meat. Rabbi Elazar continues: <b>By inference,</b> one can derive <b>that if they had offered</b> the sin offering they would have disqualified it, and it would have been <b>proper</b> that <b>it was burned.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:19 | they offered | Zevachim 16b:5 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Where is</b> an acute mourner <b>prohibited</b> from performing sacrificial rites, as asserted in the inference? <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And he shall not leave the Sanctuary,</b> and he will not profane the Sanctuary of his God” (Leviticus 21:12), then the above <i>a fortiori</i> inference is unnecessary, since <b>profanation itself is written in</b> the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “This day have <b>they offered</b> their sin offering?” (Leviticus 10:19), <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the sin offering brought by Aaron <b>was burned because</b> Aaron and his sons were in <b>acute mourning.</b> |
| Leviticus 10:20 | “And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes” | Zevachim 101a:12 | Moses <b>immediately conceded</b> to Aaron, as the verse states: <b>“And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes”</b> (Leviticus 10:20). <b>And Moses was not embarrassed</b> and did not attempt to justify himself <b>by saying: I did not hear</b> of this <i>halakha</i> until now. <b>Rather, he said: I heard</b> it, <b>and I forgot</b> it, as the verse indicates by stating: “Moses heard.” |
| Leviticus 10:20 | and it was good in his eyes” | Zevachim 101b:1 | <b>and it was good in his eyes”</b> (Leviticus 10:20). <b>Moses was not embarrassed</b> and did not attempt to justify himself <b>by saying: I did not hear</b> this <i>halakha</i> until now. <b>Rather,</b> he said: <b>I heard</b> it, <b>and I forgot</b> it. |
| Leviticus 11:2 | as it is written: “These are the living beings [ haḥayya ] that you may eat | Chullin 37a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the flesh of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is permitted</b> by means of slaughter? The Gemara responds with a question: <b>And from where would it enter your mind that it is prohibited?</b> The Gemara explains that one may have thought it is prohibited, <b>as it is written: “These are the living beings [<i>haḥayya</i>] that you may eat</b> among all the animals that are on the earth” (Leviticus 11:2). One might have thought that the verse is saying: <b>Eat</b> an animal that is fit to <b>live [<i>ḥayya</i>], but do not eat</b> an animal <b>that is not</b> fit to <b>live. And this</b> animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is not</b> fit to <b>live.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:2 | a positive | Chullin 37a:7 | The Gemara questions that understanding. <b>And perhaps, actually I will say to you:</b> The halakhic status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass is</b> the same as <b>that of</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, but if one slaughters the animal in danger of imminent death <b>while alive,</b> he would be <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive</b> mitzva: “These are the living beings that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:2), whereas <b>after</b> its <b>death,</b> he would be <b>in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition:</b> “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21). |
| Leviticus 11:2 | as it is written: “These are the living things which you may eat | Chullin 42a:7 | It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “These are the living things which you may eat</b> among all the animals that are on the earth” (Leviticus 11:2). The verse indicates that you may <b>eat a living</b> animal, i.e., one that can survive, but <b>you may not eat</b> an animal <b>that is not living,</b> i.e., one that cannot survive. One learns <b>by inference that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:3 | domesticated animal: “Whatsoever parts the hoof, | Chullin 59a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the signs of a kosher domesticated animal are stated in the Torah. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the signs of a</b> kosher <b>domesticated animal: “Whatsoever parts the hoof,</b> and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat” (Leviticus 11:3). <b>Any animal that chews the cud certainly has no upper</b> front <b>teeth,</b> i.e., incisors, <b>and is kosher.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:3 | that have fins but do not have scales. | Niddah 51b:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is written: “Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, you may eat them” (Leviticus 11:9). There is a principle with regard to the signs indicating that fish are kosher: <b>Any</b> fish <b>that has scales has fins; and there are</b> fish <b>that have fins but do not have scales.</b> Similarly, with regard to kosher animals it is written: “Whatever parts the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:3). <b>Any</b> animal <b>that has horns has hooves; and there are</b> animals <b>that have hooves but do not have horns.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:3 | that may you eat” | Zevachim 34a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i> cited in <i>Torat Kohanim</i>: “Whatsoever parts the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, <b>that may you eat”</b> (Leviticus 11:3). One can infer: <b>But</b> you may <b>not</b> eat <b>a non-kosher animal; and a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva</b> has the status of <b>a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:4 | impure | Bekhorot 16a:10 | The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to the substitute of disqualified consecrated</b> animals <b>that it</b> must <b>die?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states:</b> “Nevertheless, these you shall not eat, <b>of them that</b> only <b>chew the cud,</b> or of them that only have a split hoof…it is <b>impure</b> to you” (Leviticus 11:4). The extraneous phrase “impure to you” indicates that there exists an animal which possesses the signs of a kosher animal but is nevertheless prohibited in consumption, and that is the substitute of a disqualified consecrated animal. The Gemara raises an objection: But isn’t <b>that</b> extraneous phrase <b>necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the five sin offerings</b> that are left to <b>die,</b> which may not be eaten? The Gemara answers: No; <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> from the phrase: <b>“Of them that</b> only <b>have a split hoof</b>…is <b>impure.”</b> |
| Leviticus 11:4 | “Nevertheless these shall you not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that split the hoof” | Bekhorot 6a:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> that when the verse states: <b>“Nevertheless these shall you not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that split the hoof”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), this verse indicates that <b>you have</b> an animal <b>that chews the cud and has split hooves, but</b> nevertheless <b>you may not eat it. And which is this?</b> It is <b>a kosher</b> animal <b>that was born from a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Or</b> perhaps it excludes <b>only a non-kosher</b> animal that does not chew the cud or have split hooves <b>that was born from a kosher</b> animal, <b>and</b> if so <b>what</b> is the explanation of the verse <b>“of them that chew the cud, or of them that split the hoof”?</b> |
| Leviticus 11:4 | the verse states: “The camel…is impure | Bekhorot 6b:1 | <b>This</b> is what it <b>is saying: You shall not eat a being that comes from</b> one of those animals that <b>chew their cud and have split hooves</b> if it itself does not have the signs of being kosher. To counter this, the continuation of <b>the verse states: “The camel…is impure</b> for you” (Leviticus 11:4). This indicates that a camel itself <b>is non-kosher, but a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that is born from a kosher</b> animal <b>is not non-kosher; rather,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:4 | “Camel” | Bekhorot 6b:2 | <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> it is stated: <b>“Camel”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), <b>“camel”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), teaching the term <b>two times</b> with regard to the prohibition of consumption. This teaches that <b>both a camel that is born from a camel and a camel that is born from a cow</b> are non-kosher. According to Rabbi Shimon, a non-kosher animal born to a kosher animal is forbidden for consumption, in contrast to the ruling in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 11:4 | “Camel” | Bekhorot 7a:20 | § The Gemara returns to the dilemma of whether Rabbi Shimon permits the consumption of the offspring of a kosher animal that resembles a non-kosher animal but has some of the characteristics of its mother. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> it is stated: <b>“Camel”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), <b>“camel”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), i.e., the term is written <b>two times</b> with regard to the prohibition against consumption. This teaches that <b>both a camel that is born from a camel and a camel that is born from a cow</b> are non-kosher. <b>And if</b> in the latter case <b>its head and the majority of</b> its body <b>are similar to its mother, it is permitted for consumption.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:4 | “Nevertheless these shall you not eat from them that only chew the cud, or from them that only have a split hoof: | Bekhorot 7a:5 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: <b>“Nevertheless these shall you not eat from them that only chew the cud, or from them that only have a split hoof:</b> The camel” (Leviticus 11:4). The phrase: “From them that only chew the cud,” which is referring to animals that are forbidden for consumption, indicates that a camel or other non-kosher animal that is born to a kosher animal is forbidden. Furthermore, the word “these” teaches that concerning <b>these</b> animals that resemble a non-kosher animal, <b>you may not eat</b> them when they are born to a kosher animal, <b>but you may eat</b> a non-kosher animal <b>that comes with one characteristic</b> of its mother. |
| Leviticus 11:4 | “The camel, because it chews the cud | Chullin 59a:12 | The Gemara asks: How can one rely only on an inspection of the mouth? <b>Did you not say that there is a young camel,</b> which has no upper incisors but is still non-kosher? If so, perhaps <b>there is also another species that is similar to a young camel</b> and is non-kosher despite having no upper incisors. The Gemara responds that this possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“The camel, because it chews the cud</b> but parts not the hoof, it is unclean” (Leviticus 11:4). <b>The Ruler of His world knows that nothing other than</b> the <b>camel chews the cud and is</b> still <b>non-kosher. Therefore, the verse singles it out</b> with the word <b>“it,”</b> i.e., it and no other. |
| Leviticus 11:4 | the camel, because it chews the cud | Ketubot 60a:6 | This is as <b>the verse states:</b> “But this you shall not eat, of those that only chew the cud, or of those that only part the hoof; <b>the camel, because it chews the cud</b> but does not part the hoof, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:4). The somewhat superfluous word “it” teaches that <b>it</b> alone <b>is impure, but</b> the <b>milk</b> of <b>bipeds is not impure; rather,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> Furthermore, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I should exclude the milk</b> of humans from the prohibition against consumption, as this issue <b>does not apply equally to everyone,</b> since only women produce milk, but <b>I should not exclude</b> from the prohibition human <b>blood, which</b> does <b>apply equally to everyone.</b> Consequently, <b>the verse states “it”</b> with regard to a camel, to say that <b>it</b> alone <b>is impure,</b> whereas the <b>blood</b> of <b>bipeds is not impure,</b> but <b>rather</b> is <b>kosher.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:6 | they wrote for him: The short-legged beast [ tze’irat haraglayim ]. And they did not write for him: “And the hare [ arnevet ]” | Megillah 9b:3 | <b>And</b> in the list of unclean animals <b>they wrote for him: The short-legged beast [<i>tze’irat haraglayim</i>]. And they did not write for him: “And the hare [<i>arnevet</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:6), <b>since the name of Ptolemy’s wife</b> was <b>Arnevet, so that he would not say: The Jews have mocked me and inserted my wife’s name in the Torah.</b> Therefore, they did not refer to the hare by name, but by one of its characteristic features. |
| Leviticus 11:7 | “And the pig, because it parts the hoof, | Chullin 59a:14 | The Gemara asks: But <b>didn’t you say that there is a pig,</b> which has cloven hooves but is still non-kosher? If so, perhaps <b>there is also another species that is similar to a pig.</b> The Gemara responds that this possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the pig, because it parts the hoof,</b> and is cloven-footed, but chews not the cud, it is unclean” (Leviticus 11:7). <b>The Ruler of His world knows that nothing other than</b> the <b>pig parts the hoof and is</b> still <b>non-kosher. Therefore, the verse singles it out</b> with the word <b>“it.”</b> |
| Leviticus 11:8 | And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to purify himself on a Festival, as it is stated: “And their carcasses you shall not touch; | Rosh Hashanah16b:9 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to purify himself on a Festival, as it is stated: “And their carcasses you shall not touch;</b> they are impure to you” (Leviticus 11:8). This verse is referring to the Festivals, as taught in the following <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 11:9 | As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught, | Bava Kamma64b:8 | <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> concerning the verse: “These may you eat of all that are in the waters: Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers” (Leviticus 11:9), as follows: The verse states: <b>“In the waters,” “in the waters,” two times</b> and only afterward lists the details of seas and rivers. <b>This is not</b> expounded as <b>a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization, because the detail does not appear between the generalizations. <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified,</b> and thereby <b>amplified</b> the general category “waters” to include <b>everything</b> except for “seas” and “rivers,” the specific matter excluded in the restriction. Here too, since the two generalizations are written before the details, it is expounded as an amplification, a restriction and an amplification. |
| Leviticus 11:9 | As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: | Bekhorot 51a:18 | <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When defining which fish it is permitted to eat, the verse states: “This you may eat, from whatever is in the water, anything that has fins and scales in the water, in the seas and in the streams” (Leviticus 11:9). The verse first states the general term <b>“in the water,” “in the water,”</b> mentioning it <b>twice,</b> and only afterward mentions the details, i.e., “in the seas and in the streams.” When the general and detailed phrases are ordered in this way, they <b>are not</b> expounded as <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> but <b>rather</b> the verse <b>amplified and restricted.</b> Similarly, although Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi generally expounds verses using the method of generalizations and details, with regard to the redemption of the firstborn, since the verse mentions the two general terms first and mentions the specific detail only afterward, he expounds it using the method of amplifications and restrictions. |
| Leviticus 11:9 | “Fins and scales” | Chullin 63b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why must one rely on the gentile? <b>Let him inspect</b> the eggs <b>for signs, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Like the signs of</b> kosher <b>eggs, so</b> too are <b>the signs of fish.</b> The Gemara interjects: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the signs of fish? The Merciful One states</b> them explicitly in the Torah: <b>“Fins and scales”</b> (Leviticus 11:9). <b>Rather, say: So</b> too are <b>the signs of</b> |
| Leviticus 11:9 | MISHNA: | Niddah 51b:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is written: “Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, you may eat them” (Leviticus 11:9). There is a principle with regard to the signs indicating that fish are kosher: <b>Any</b> fish <b>that has scales has fins; and there are</b> fish <b>that have fins but do not have scales.</b> Similarly, with regard to kosher animals it is written: “Whatever parts the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:3). <b>Any</b> animal <b>that has horns has hooves; and there are</b> animals <b>that have hooves but do not have horns.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:9 | As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: | Shevuot 5a:3 | <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When defining which fish it is permitted to eat, the verse states: “This you may eat, from whatever is in the water, anything that has fins and scales in the water, in the seas and in the streams” (Leviticus 11:9). The verse first states the general term: <b>“In the water,” “in the water,”</b> mentioning it <b>twice,</b> and only afterward mentions the details, i.e., “in the seas and in the streams.” When the general and detailed phrases are ordered in this way, they <b>are not</b> expounded as <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> but <b>rather</b> as <b>an amplification and a restriction.</b> Similarly, although Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi generally expounds verses using the method of generalizations and details, with regard to the redemption of the firstborn, since the verse mentions the two general terms first and mentions the specific detail only afterward, he expounds it using the method of amplifications and restrictions. |
| Leviticus 11:10 | It is different there, as the verse said: “For you” | Pesachim 23a:9 | The Gemara challenges both opinions. <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition against eating <b>creeping animals, as the Merciful One says:</b> “And every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth <b>is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 11:41). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If hunters of undomesticated animals, birds, and fish happen to catch non-kosher species</b> that they did not intend to trap, <b>it is permitted for them to sell</b> them <b>to gentiles.</b> Apparently, one may derive benefit from non-kosher species even though the verse says: “It shall not be eaten.” The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse said: “For you”</b> (Leviticus 11:10), indicating that <b>they will be yours,</b> that one may derive benefit from them. |
| Leviticus 11:11 | “Their carcasses you shall have in detestation” | Chullin 67b:12 | The Gemara recounts: <b>Ravina said to his mother: Conceal</b> the fish’s worms inside it so I cannot see them, <b>and I will eat</b> the fish. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Aḥa, said to Ravina: What is different</b> in this case <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“Their carcasses you shall have in detestation”</b> (Leviticus 11:11), serves <b>to include worms that are in animals</b> as forbidden? Why are worms in fish permitted? |
| Leviticus 11:11 | as the verse said: “They shall be” | Pesachim 23a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that it is permitted to derive benefit from these creeping animals, then <b>even</b> if one intends to catch them it should <b>also</b> be permitted to sell them to gentiles <i>ab initio</i>. However, the mishna indicates that this is prohibited. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> in the case of creeping animals, <b>as the verse said: “They shall be”</b> (Leviticus 11:11). It is derived from this that <b>they shall be as they are.</b> In other words, they should remain in their detestable state, and one should stay away from them. |
| Leviticus 11:13 | “The nesher ” | Chullin 60b:16 | § The mishna states: <b>The signs of the</b> kosher <b>bird were not</b> explicitly <b>stated</b> in the Torah. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that they were <b>not</b> stated in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The <i>nesher</i>”</b> (Leviticus 11:13) is a non-kosher bird. |
| Leviticus 11:15 | crow and nothing more? But isn’t it taught | Chullin 62a:2 | The Gemara asks: Must he recognize only the <b>crow and nothing more? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Every <i>orev</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:15). With regard to the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the</b> well-known <b>crow;</b> as for the phrase <b>“after its kinds,” Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is written <b>to include the <i>zarzir</i>,</b> another type of crow, to teach that it is non-kosher. The Sages <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: But wouldn’t the people of Kefar Temarta in Judea eat</b> the <i>zarzir</i>, <b>because it has a crop?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: They too will be judged in the future</b> for their transgression. |
| Leviticus 11:16 | As it is stated: “And the daughter [ bat ] of the ya’ana ” | Chullin 64b:4 | § <b>Ḥizkiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the egg of a non-kosher</b> bird <b>is prohibited by Torah</b> law? <b>As it is stated: “And the daughter [<i>bat</i>] of the <i>ya’ana</i>”</b> (Leviticus 11:16). <b>But does the <i>ya’ana</i> have a daughter</b> whose forbidden status would be different from that of its mother? Both daughter and mother should be included in the same prohibition. <b>Rather, which</b> is this? <b>This is a non-kosher egg.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps this is their name,</b> i.e., the bird is called <i>bat ya’ana</i>. The Gemara responds: This <b>should not enter your mind, as it is written: “The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the <i>ye’enim</i> in the wilderness”</b> (Lamentations 4:3). |
| Leviticus 11:20 | a non-kosher winged creature is written explicitly: | Bekhorot 7b:7 | The Gemara asks: Why is this inference necessary? The prohibition against eating <b>a non-kosher winged creature is written explicitly:</b> “All winged creatures that go upon all fours are a repugnance to you” (Leviticus 11:20). <b>Rather,</b> the inference must be understood as follows: <b>You may not eat a non-kosher winged creature, but you may eat that which a non-kosher winged creature discharges</b> from its body, <b>and what is that? That is the honey of bees.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:21 | and it is written there: “ Lenatter upon the earth” | Bava Kamma38a:8 | <b>And from where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term <b><i>vayyatter</i> is a term of exile? It is written here: “And made the nations tremble [<i>vayyatter</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6), <b>and it is written there: “<i>Lenatter</i> upon the earth”</b> (Leviticus 11:21), <b>which is translated</b> into Aramaic as: <b>“To leap upon the earth.”</b> Apparently, the root <i>nun</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>reish</i>, common to both words, indicates uprooting from one place to another. |
| Leviticus 11:21 | “Yet these may you eat of all winged creatures” | Bekhorot 7b:6 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that it is stated: <b>“Yet these may you eat of all winged creatures”</b> (Leviticus 11:21). The word “these” indicates that <b>you may eat these, but you may not eat a non-kosher winged creature.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:21 | which have [ lo ] jointed legs | Chullin 65a:8 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A grasshopper that <b>has no</b> wings <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after a time, e.g., the <i>zaḥal</i>, is permitted. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says:</b> The verse states: “Yet these may you eat of all winged swarming things that go upon all fours, <b>which have [<i>lo</i>] jointed legs</b> above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:21). The word <i>lo</i> is written with the letter <i>alef</i>, meaning not, so that it can be understood as: Do not have jointed legs. This teaches that <b>even though it has no</b> jointed legs <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after a time,</b> it is still kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>zaḥal</i>? Abaye said:</b> It is called <b><i>askarin</i></b> in Aramaic. |
| Leviticus 11:21 | “which have jointed legs” | Chullin 66a:2 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the study hall holds</b> that the previous verse, permitting all species <b>“which have jointed legs”</b> (Leviticus 11:21), is <b>a generalization.</b> The species <b><i>arbeh</i>, <i>solam</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>,</b> and <b><i>ḥagav</i>,</b> and the phrase <b>“after its kinds,”</b> that appears after each, are <b>a detail.</b> As a rule, in any instance of <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization includes only that which is</b> spelled out <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, only grasshoppers <b>of the</b> same <b>species as</b> those detailed in the verse <b>are</b> kosher. Grasshoppers <b>that are not of the</b> same <b>species as</b> them are <b>not</b> kosher. <b>And</b> the phrase “after its kinds” <b>amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include grasshoppers <b>that are similar to</b> the named species <b>in two aspects,</b> i.e., that are very similar to them. Since all the named species have short heads, grasshoppers with long heads are forbidden. |
| Leviticus 11:22 | “These of them you may eat: The arbeh | Chullin 65a:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“These of them you may eat: The <i>arbeh</i></b> after its kinds, and the <i>solam</i> after its kinds, and the <i>ḥargol</i> after its kinds, and the <i>ḥagav</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:22). The <b><i>arbeh</i> is</b> the insect known as the <b><i>govai</i>.</b> The <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>.</b> The <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>.</b> The <b><i>ḥagav</i> is</b> the <b><i>gadyan</i>. Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “After its kinds,” “after its kinds,” “after its kinds,”</b> and <b>“after its kinds,” four times? It is to include</b> four similar species: The <b>vineyard bird, and</b> the <b>Jerusalem <i>yoḥana</i>, and the <i>artzuveya</i>, and the <i>razbanit</i>,</b> which are also kosher. |
| Leviticus 11:24 | about this one, | Pesachim 67b:11 | The Gemara expresses surprise: Why did the mishna need to teach that they are comparable with regard to <b>their impurity? Impurity until evening is</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the Torah <b>about this one,</b> meaning that one who came into contact with a creeping animal is impure until the evening and then must undergo ritual immersion in order to become pure, as it states: “And for these you shall be unclean; whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until evening” (Leviticus 11:24). <b>And impurity until evening is</b> explicitly <b>written about that one,</b> one who experienced a seminal emission, as it states: “And if semen goes out from a man, then shall he bathe all his flesh in water and be unclean until evening” (Leviticus 15:16). <b>Rather, is it not</b> that they are compared with regard to <b>their camps,</b> which is not explicit in the Torah? |
| Leviticus 11:27 | of Rabbi Yitzḥak | Chullin 70b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And since</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, why do I</b> need the proof <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> from the verse: “And whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks on all fours” (Leviticus 11:27)? The Gemara explains: <b>Were it not</b> for the derivation of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, I would say</b> that <b>the entire</b> verse expounded by Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>comes to</b> teach only <b>that which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derived from it, as cited by the Gemara later on. Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement <b>teaches us</b> that the verse is also to be expounded as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explained. |
| Leviticus 11:27 | whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks | Chullin 70b:13 | But <b>we did not</b> yet <b>learn</b> about <b>a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal. From where</b> is it derived that it imparts impurity? Ben Azzai <b>said to me</b> that this is derived from the verse: “And <b>whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks</b> on all fours” (Leviticus 11:27). The inclusive term “among any” serves to include even a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal among those that impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:27 | “And whatever walks on its paws, among any [ bekhol ] undomesticated animal [ ḥayya ] that walks | Chullin 70b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, what is the reason</b> for his ruling? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said that the verse states</b> with regard to non-kosher animals that do not have cloven hooves: <b>“And whatever walks on its paws, among any [<i>bekhol</i>] undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] that walks</b> on all fours, they are impure for you; whoever touches their carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:27). Rabbi Yosei HaGelili expounds this verse as follows: Those animals <b>that walk on</b> their <b>paws,</b> i.e., that do not have cloven hooves, which are <b>inside</b> the body of <b>an animal, I rendered impure for you.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak interprets the term <i>bekhol</i> as meaning: Inside the body of, and the word <i>ḥayya</i> as meaning: A live animal. Accordingly, he understands the verse to be referring to a dead fetus found inside a living animal. |
| Leviticus 11:29 | The Sages taught | Chullin 126b:18 | §<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the following verse: “And these are they which are impure to you among the creeping animals that creep upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>Since “mouse” is stated</b> among the creeping animals that impart impurity, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a sea mouse,</b> i.e., a sea creature that has an appearance similar to a mouse, imparts impurity <b>because its name is</b> also <b>mouse. But</b> ostensibly, the opposite conclusion could be derived through <b>logical inference:</b> The verse <b>deems a weasel impure and deems a mouse impure.</b> Therefore, <b>just as a weasel is a species that grows on land, so too</b> the <b>mouse</b> to which the verse is referring is <b>a species that grows on land;</b> a sea mouse does not impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:29 | “The great lizard after its kinds” | Chullin 127a:9 | §With regard to the topic of the eight creeping animals mentioned in the Torah, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“The great lizard after its kinds”</b> (Leviticus 11:29) <b>includes</b> in the category of creeping animals <b>the <i>arvad</i>,</b> a type of snake, <b>and also</b> the creeping animals called <b><i>nefilim</i> and salamander [<i>salamandera</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 11:29 | the verse states: “And these are they which are impure to you” | Keritot 22a:3 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And these are they which are impure to you”</b> (Leviticus 11:29), which indicates that <b>these</b> animals enumerated in that chapter are <b>non-kosher</b> and their milk is forbidden for consumption, <b>but the milk of bipeds is not impure</b> but <b>rather pure,</b> i.e., kosher. |
| Leviticus 11:29 | “And these are they that are impure | Keritot 4b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is this <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., from the derivation from the verse: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood”? <b>It is derived from there,</b> from a different verse, as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And these are they that are impure</b> for you among the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:29). This <b>teaches with regard to</b> the <b>blood of</b> one of <b>the</b> eight <b>creeping animals</b> listed in the Torah <b>and</b> the flesh of <b>the creeping animal, that they combine with each other</b> to constitute the minimum volume. |
| Leviticus 11:29 | that the verse states: “And these are they that are impure | Meilah 17a:10 | § The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash asked Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai in the city of Rome: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> the <b>blood of creeping animals that it is impure?</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>said to him:</b> It is derived from the fact <b>that the verse states: “And these are they that are impure</b> for you among the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:29). Since a similar phrase already appears in Leviticus 11:31, it is derived from here that the blood of creeping animals is impure. |
| Leviticus 11:29 | “And these are they that are impure | Meilah 17b:4 | Why did Rabbi Shimon end up punishing Rabbi Elazar? <b>When they were walking on the road, this</b> following <b>question was asked before them: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of a creeping animal that it is impure? Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Yosei twisted his mouth</b> to whisper <b>and said:</b> It is derived from the verse: <b>“And these are they that are impure</b> for you among the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:29). Although Rabbi Elazar tried to whisper so that Rabbi Shimon would not hear, <b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: From the twisting of your mouth</b> and your answer <b>it is clear</b> that <b>you are a Torah scholar.</b> Nevertheless, it is prohibited for a student to issue a ruling of <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher. Therefore, I curse you that <b>the son will not return</b> from this journey <b>to his father.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:29 | as it is written: “And these are they which are unclean for you | Menachot 29a:15 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Three matters were difficult for Moses</b> to comprehend precisely, <b>until the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed</b> them to <b>him with His finger, and these are</b> the three matters: The form of the <b>Candelabrum, and</b> the exact size of the <b>new moon, and</b> the impure <b>creeping animals.</b> The <b>Candelabrum</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And this is the work of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:4). The <b>new moon</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “This month shall be for you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). The <b>creeping animals</b> were shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And these are they which are unclean for you</b> among the swarming things” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that God <b>also</b> showed Moses <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughtering, as it is stated: “Now this is that which you shall sacrifice upon the altar”</b> (Exodus 29:38), and slaughtering is the first ritual of sacrifice. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | that are impure [ hateme’im ] | Bekhorot 6b:7 | In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to the prohibition against eating creeping animals: “These are they <b>that are impure [<i>hateme’im</i>]</b> to you among all the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:31). The Sages interpret the letter <i>heh</i> in the term “that are impure [<i>hateme’im</i>]” <b>to prohibit their juice</b> that oozes from their body <b>and their gravy</b> that is produced when they are cooked, <b>and sediments</b> of <b>their</b> flesh that congeal at the bottom of the dish when cooked. Evidently, any liquid that emerges from a non-kosher animal is forbidden. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | them | Chagigah 11a:13 | § The mishna stated that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity</b> also have something to support them. Once again the Gemara asks: Ritual impurity <b>is written</b> explicitly in the Torah. The Gemara answers: This <b>is necessary only with regard to the</b> size <b>of a lentil-bulk from a creeping animal, which is not written. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that deals with creeping animals: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31). |
| Leviticus 11:31 | the unclean | Chullin 112b:6 | Rava <b>said to him:</b> When the verse states, with regard to forbidden foods: “These are <b>the unclean</b> to you” (Leviticus 11:31), the added definite article serves <b>to prohibit</b> not only their flesh but also <b>their juice</b> emitted by salting, <b>and their gravy, and their spices</b> with which they are cooked. Even while the kosher meat is emitting its blood, it still absorbs the juices of the non-kosher meat, which are absorbed more easily than blood. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | that are impure [ hatteme’im ] | Chullin 120a:33 | §The Gemara challenges: <b>But that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> is difficult. The Torah states with regard to the prohibition against eating creeping animals: “These are they <b>that are impure [<i>hatteme’im</i>]</b> to you among all the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:31). The Sages interpret the letter <i>heh</i> in the term “<i>hatteme’im</i>” <b>to forbid their juice</b> that oozes from their carcasses, <b>and their gravy</b> that is produced when they are cooked, <b>and sediments</b> of <b>their</b> flesh that congeal at the bottom of the dish when cooked. The Gemara explains the challenge: <b>Why do I</b> need a verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Let</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>be learned from these</b> <i>halakhot</i> of melted forbidden fat, a liquefied bird carcass, and dissolved leavened bread. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | the Sages taught | Chullin 126b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that in the case of an egg of a creeping animal in which tissue of an embryo developed, if it is perforated then one who touches it is ritually impure. With regard to this matter <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “These are the impure ones to you among all that creep; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). The term <b>“the impure ones”</b> is interpreted as <b>including the egg of a creeping animal and the thigh bone of a creeping animal</b> in the category of sources of impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | “when they are dead” is written twice, | Chullin 74a:6 | The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the phrase “when they are dead, it shall be impure” <b>is still necessary</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that they impart impurity only when they are still in a state <b>similar to</b> their state at the time of their <b>death,</b> i.e., if they <b>are moist they impart impurity,</b> whereas if they <b>are dry they do not impart impurity.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>“when they are dead” is written twice,</b> once in the verse cited, and once in the previous verse, which states: “Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). |
| Leviticus 11:31 | the impure [ hateme’in ] | Meilah 17a:5 | <b>And similarly, Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina says,</b> in rejection of Rav Zeira’s statement: It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “These are <b>the impure [<i>hateme’in</i>]</b> to you among all that creep; whoever touches them when they are dead, shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). This plural form of “<i>hateme’in</i>” <b>teaches that they join together</b> to impart ritual impurity. <b>And</b> this applies <b>even</b> to the flesh of <b>a creeping animal and</b> the flesh of another <b>creeping animal,</b> or the flesh of <b>a creeping animal and</b> the <b>blood</b> of another creeping animal, <b>whether</b> they are <b>from one category,</b> i.e., one type of creeping animal, <b>or from two categories</b> of creeping animal. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | them | Nazir 52a:1 | <b>Rav Yehuda from Diskarta said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following halakhic midrash concerning the ritual impurity of creeping animals. The verse states: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31). One <b>might</b> have thought this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., to complete creatures. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them,</b> when they are dead, fall, it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32), which indicates that part of these creatures also imparts impurity. <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were derived solely from the phrase <b>“of them,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that it applies even to <b>a small part</b> of them. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Them,”</b> which means all of them. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | them | Niddah 56a:12 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Bisna, says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> When the verse states: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31), one <b>might</b> have thought that creeping animals transmit impurity only if one comes into contact <b>with all of them,</b> i.e., with creeping animals that are completely intact. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32), indicating that even a part of them transmits impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | when they are dead | Niddah 56a:15 | The carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> transmits impurity only when moist, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Whoever touches them <b>when they are dead</b> shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31). This indicates that they transmit impurity when they are in a state <b>similar to</b> their state at the time of <b>death,</b> when creatures are still moist. <b>Semen</b> transmits impurity only when moist, as it must be <b>fit to inseminate. An animal carcass</b> transmits impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> any animal of which you may eat <b>dies,</b> he who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39), which teaches that the carcass transmits impurity when it is in a state <b>similar to</b> its state at the time of <b>death.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:31 | them | Niddah 56a:8 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Bisna, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> The verse states with regard to creeping animals: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). One <b>might</b> have thought that the carcasses of creeping animals transmit impurity only if one comes into contact <b>with all of them,</b> i.e., with creeping animals that are completely intact. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). The term “any of them” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one comes into contact with only part of a creeping animal. |
| Leviticus 11:31 | “Those are for you the impure | Shabbat 107a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>One who wounds them is liable, by inference they have skins.</b> One is liable for inflicting a wound only when there is skin covering the flesh and the blood pools beneath it. <b>Who is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> who teaches this? <b>Shmuel said: It is Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: The eight creeping animals</b> that are listed in the Torah <b>have skins.</b> Their flesh transmits impurity, but their skin does not transmit impurity. The Rabbis say that both the skin and the flesh of some creeping animals transmit impurity. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav</b> said: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis, the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri only with regard to the matter</b> of <b>impurity, as it is written</b> after the Torah lists the creeping animals: <b>“Those are for you the impure</b> among the creeping animals, whoever touches them when they are dead shall become impure until evening” (Leviticus 11:31). The Rabbis derive from the extraneous term: “Those are for you the impure,” <b>to include the</b> fact that the <b>skins of</b> the creatures in the second verse transmit impurity just <b>as their flesh</b> does. <b>However, with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat, even the Rabbis concede</b> that their skin is distinct from their flesh. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | “When they have died” | Avodah Zarah68b:15 | <b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> With regard to the ritual impurity of semen, <b>the Merciful One states: “The flow of seed”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), meaning that the reference is to semen that is <b>fit to fertilize. Here too,</b> with regard to the ritual impurity of a mouse, the verse states: <b>“When they have died”</b> (Leviticus 11:32). <b>The Merciful One states</b> that the carcasses of creeping animals impart impurity only when they are <b>similar to</b> their state at time of <b>their death,</b> i.e., when they are still moist. Therefore, there is no contradiction to the claim that the prohibition against eating a mouse is a novelty and consequently applies even when it detracted from the flavor of the food into which it fell. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | a garment or leather” | Bava Kamma25b:6 | The second derivation is as follows: <b>But from where</b> is it derived that <b>a mat</b> contracts impurity <b>from a corpse?</b> It is derived through a verbal analogy. <b>With regard to</b> impurity imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, it is stated:</b> “Or <b>a garment or leather”</b> (Leviticus 11:32), <b>and with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse it is stated: “A garment, or</b> anything made of <b>leather”</b> (Numbers 31:20). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a creeping animal, a mat</b> becomes <b>impure from it, so too</b> with regard to the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a corpse, a mat</b> becomes <b>impure from it.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:32 | of them | Chagigah 11a:14 | One <b>might</b> have thought that only someone who touches <b>an entire,</b> whole creeping animal becomes ritually impure. <b>The verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls, when they are dead, it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). “Of them” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one comes into contact with a part of them. One <b>might</b> have thought that even <b>some of them</b> suffices to impart impurity. <b>The verse states: “Them,”</b> i.e., all of them. This conclusion apparently contradicts the first ruling. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | cannot become impure. What is the reason | Chagigah 26b:5 | The Gemara poses a question concerning the requirement to keep <i>amei ha’aretz</i> away from the table: <b>And let us derive it,</b> i.e., let it be established, that it is not necessary to take care against contact with the table, as it is incapable of contracting ritual impurity. This is <b>because it is a wooden vessel designated to rest</b> in a fixed place, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>any</b> large, <b>wooden vessel designated to rest</b> in a fixed place <b>cannot become impure. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? Since wooden vessels and sacks are juxtaposed in the verse describing their impurity (Leviticus 11:32), <b>we require</b> a wooden vessel <b>to be similar to a sack</b> in order to be capable of contracting impurity, in the following manner: <b>Just as a sack is carried</b> when it is both <b>full and empty, so too any</b> wooden vessel that is <b>carried full and empty</b> can contract impurity, as opposed to vessels, such as the table, that are designated to rest in a fixed place. The table should therefore not be susceptible to impurity at all. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | when they are dead | Chullin 128b:15 | The Gemara states a different <i>halakha</i> where these three <i>tanna’im</i> express the same opinions. <b>So too, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to creeping animals like this case:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>flesh that separates from a creeping animal</b> during its lifetime <b>should be impure</b> like a creeping animal carcass. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to creeping animal carcasses: “And upon whatever any of them falls <b>when they are dead</b> shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). The word “dead” teaches that <b>just as death does not generate a replacement, so too any</b> element of a creeping animal <b>that</b> dies and <b>does not generate a replacement</b> imparts the impurity of a creeping animal carcass, excluding flesh; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:32 | “And anything that these fall upon, when they are dead, it shall be impure” | Chullin 74a:4 | § <b>Rava said: From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived: The <b>death</b> of an animal by means other than slaughter <b>renders</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the slaughter, whereas the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>does not render</b> a limb as though it had already <b>fallen off? As it is written</b> with regard to the eight species of impure creeping animals: <b>“And anything that these fall upon, when they are dead, it shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:32). <b>What</b> does the term “when they are dead” serve <b>to exclude? If we say</b> it serves <b>to exclude</b> the time <b>when they are alive,</b> that principle is <b>derived from:</b> “And everything upon which any part <b>of their carcass</b> falls shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:35), which explicitly states that only their carcasses impart impurity. <b>Rather, learn from</b> the verse that <b>death renders</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off,</b> and <b>slaughter does not render</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:32 | What is the reason | Menachot 96b:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The verse states with regard to items that are rendered impure by the carcasses of creeping animals: “And anything upon which any of them fall when they are dead shall be impure, whether it is any vessel of wood, or cloth, or leather, or sack” (Leviticus 11:32). The verse juxtaposes wooden vessels with sacks, indicating that <b>we require</b> a wooden vessel to be <b>similar to a sack</b> in order to be susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>Just as a sack is carried</b> both when it is <b>full and</b> when it is <b>empty, so too, any</b> wooden vessel that is <b>carried</b> both <b>full and empty</b> is susceptible to impurity. Since the Table is designated to rest in a fixed place and not to be carried, it should not be susceptible to impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | of them, | Nazir 52a:1 | <b>Rav Yehuda from Diskarta said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following halakhic midrash concerning the ritual impurity of creeping animals. The verse states: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31). One <b>might</b> have thought this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., to complete creatures. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them,</b> when they are dead, fall, it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32), which indicates that part of these creatures also imparts impurity. <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were derived solely from the phrase <b>“of them,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that it applies even to <b>a small part</b> of them. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Them,”</b> which means all of them. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | of them | Niddah 56a:12 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Bisna, says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> When the verse states: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31), one <b>might</b> have thought that creeping animals transmit impurity only if one comes into contact <b>with all of them,</b> i.e., with creeping animals that are completely intact. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32), indicating that even a part of them transmits impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | of them | Niddah 56a:8 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Bisna, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> The verse states with regard to creeping animals: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). One <b>might</b> have thought that the carcasses of creeping animals transmit impurity only if one comes into contact <b>with all of them,</b> i.e., with creeping animals that are completely intact. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). The term “any of them” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one comes into contact with only part of a creeping animal. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | “Or a garment, | Shabbat 27a:1 | <b>from where does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> derive that it can become ritually impure? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, it <b>is derived from</b> the verse that speaks of the ritual impurity of creeping animals: <b>“Or a garment,</b> or skin, or sack” (Leviticus 11:32). The additional “or” comes to include items that are not generally included in the definition of garment. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the fact that it says <b>garment, I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a</b> whole <b>garment;</b> however, a swatch that is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>in other garments, from where</b> is it derived that it can become ritually impure? <b>The verse states: Or a garment.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:32 | creeping animals, | Shabbat 28a:6 | <b>Rather,</b> one could say that <b>he derived</b> it <b>from</b> the laws of the ritual impurity of <b>creeping animals,</b> as it is stated with regard to them: “And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, does fall, it shall be impure; whether it be any vessel of wood, or garment, or hide, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, with which any work is done” (Leviticus 11:32). <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the use of the word <b>hide, I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the fact that <b>the hide of a kosher animal</b> becomes ritually impure from contact with a creeping animal; however, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>the hide of a non-kosher animal</b> can become ritually impure? This is derived from the amplification, as <b>the verse states: Or hide.</b> Since, with regard to the ritual impurity of creeping animals the laws of the hides of kosher and non-kosher animals are identical, it is derived that this is also true with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. Once again, the Gemara says: <b>There is</b> room <b>to refute</b> this derivation and say: <b>What</b> is the comparison <b>to creeping animals,</b> as their legal status is stringent <b>because</b> they <b>become ritually impure</b> even if they are as small <b>as a lentil-bulk,</b> which is not true in the case of a corpse? In order for a corpse to transmit ritual impurity, it must be larger, an olive-bulk. Therefore, the Gemara says: If so, the case of <b>leprosy can prove</b> that the fact that creeping animals that are a lentil-bulk transmit impurity is not a factor in whether or not a non-kosher animal hide can become ritually impure. Leprosy that is a lentil-bulk does not transmit impurity and, nevertheless, the hide of a non-kosher animal becomes ritually impure from it. <b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point. <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case, as each case has its own unique stringencies. However, <b>their common denominator is that hide,</b> in general, <b>is ritually impure in</b> both cases, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>rendered the hide of a non-kosher animal equal</b> to <b>the hide of a kosher animal</b> in that it becomes ritually impure. <b>I will also bring</b> the additional <i>halakha</i> of a <b>tent over a corpse</b> made of the <b>hide of a non-kosher animal, and in</b> that case as well, <b>the hide of a non-kosher animal will be rendered equal to the hide of a kosher animal.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:32 | “Or a garment | Shabbat 63b:17 | <b>When Rav Dimi ascended to Neharde’a, he sent to</b> the yeshiva students: <b>The statements I said to you</b> with regard to woven fabrics of any size becoming ritually impure regardless of their size, <b>they are my mistake. However, this</b> is what <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an ornament of any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure?</b> It is derived <b>from the frontplate. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that a woven fabric of any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure?</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“Or a garment</b> or leather or sack; any vessel with which any work is done must be put into water and it shall be unclean until evening, then it shall be clean” (Leviticus 11:32). From the extraneous phrase, “or a garment,” it is derived that any garment, regardless how small, falls into this category. |
| Leviticus 11:32 | a creeping animal: | Shabbat 64a:7 | The term <b>garment and leather is stated with regard to</b> ritual impurity imparted by <b>a creeping animal:</b> “And whatever any of them falls upon when they are dead will be impure whether it be any vessel of wood, or a garment, or leather, or sack, whatever vessel it be with which any work is done it must be put into water and it will be impure until evening, then it will be clean” (Leviticus 11:32). <b>And garment and leather is stated with regard to</b> ritual impurity imparted by <b>a corpse. Just as garment and leather stated with regard to a creeping animal only rendered impure</b> objects that are <b>spun and woven, so too, garment and leather stated with regard to a corpse only rendered impure</b> objects that are <b>spun and woven.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:32 | “It must be put into water, and it shall be impure until the evening; | Yevamot 75a:7 | The Gemara asks: As for the verse stated with regard to a vessel that contracted ritual impurity through contact with a creeping animal: <b>“It must be put into water, and it shall be impure until the evening;</b> then shall it be pure” (Leviticus 11:32), <b>why do I</b> need it? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is necessary in order to teach about <b>touching.</b> An impure vessel, even after it has been immersed, still imparts ritual impurity to the <i>teruma</i> that it touches until nightfall. The same applies to an impure individual who has already undergone immersion; not only is it prohibited for him to eat <i>teruma</i>, but also he renders it impure if he touches it. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | a receptacle, | Bekhorot 38a:4 | The Gemara challenges: With regard to <b>an earthenware vessel, the Merciful One rendered</b> its susceptibility to impurity <b>dependent on</b> the presence of <b>a receptacle,</b> as it states: “And every earthen vessel into whose interior any of them falls” (Leviticus 11:33). Consequently, <b>if there is a receptacle, it will become impure,</b> but if <b>there is no receptacle, it</b> should <b>not become impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:33 | as the Sages taught | Chullin 24b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> based on the verse: “And every earthenware vessel into which [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls, whatever is in it [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure, and it you shall break” (Leviticus 11:33); if an impure item fell <b>“in it [<i>tokho</i>],” and even</b> in a case <b>where</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, the vessel becomes impure. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | into which [ tokho ] | Chullin 25a:5 | The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the carcasses of creeping animals: “And every earthenware vessel <b>into which [<i>tokho</i>]</b> any of them falls” (Leviticus 11:33), from which it is inferred: <b><i>Tokho</i>,</b> i.e., the airspace, <b>of this</b> earthenware vessel renders the vessel impure, <b>and not <i>tokho</i>,</b> the airspace, <b>of</b> any <b>other</b> kind of vessel. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | it shall be impure, | Chullin 33b:12 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 27b): <b>On that day,</b> when Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya was appointed <i>Nasi</i> in Yavne, <b>Rabbi Akiva taught: “And every earthenware vessel</b> into which any of them falls, whatever is in <b>it shall be impure,</b> and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33). With regard to the item rendered impure in the vessel, <b>it is not stated:</b> It <b>is impure [<i>tameh</i>]; rather,</b> the term <b>“it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>]”</b> is stated, indicating that the item has the capacity <b>to transmit impurity to other</b> items. <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches about a loaf</b> with <b>second-degree</b> impurity that had been rendered impure in the airspace of an earthenware vessel in which there was a creeping animal, <b>that</b> through contact <b>it renders non-sacred</b> food impure with <b>third-degree</b> ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | as the Torah testifies with regard to an earthenware vessel | Niddah 17a:23 | <b>Abaye says:</b> It is possible for all the snow to become impure, in a case <b>where one passed</b> the snow <b>within the airspace of</b> an earthenware vessel, such as <b>an oven,</b> in which the source of impurity was located. This renders the entire lump of snow impure, <b>as the Torah testifies with regard to an earthenware vessel</b> that contains a source of impurity that all items inside its airspace are rendered impure, as the verse states: “Whatever is in it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:33). |
| Leviticus 11:33 | whose interior | Niddah 42b:23 | Rava further said: If there was the carcass of <b>a creeping animal in the folds of</b> one’s body, <b>and he brought</b> the creeping animal that was in the fold <b>into the airspace of</b> a large earthenware vessel, such as <b>an oven,</b> the oven is thereby rendered <b>impure,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> when a creeping animal is placed in its airspace. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that as <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the impurity of creeping animals: “And any earthenware vessel into <b>whose interior</b> any of them fall, whatever is in it shall be impure, and it you shall break” (Leviticus 11:33), this teaches that impurity applies only if the creeping animal fell inside the vessel itself, |
| Leviticus 11:33 | any of them | Pesachim 18a:7 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>On that day,</b> when they appointed Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya the <i>Nasi</i>, <b>Rabbi Akiva taught: “And every earthenware vessel</b> into which <b>any of them</b> falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>], and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33). The verse <b>does not say: It is impure [<i>tameh</i>]; rather,</b> it says: <b>It shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>],</b> indicating that an item in an impure earthenware vessel <b>transmits impurity to other</b> items. <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches about a loaf</b> with <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity status, i.e., ritual impurity imparted through contact with a vessel impurified by a creeping animal, <b>that</b> the loaf <b>renders</b> other items impure with <b>third-</b>degree ritual impurity, even <b>non-sacred</b> items. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | whatever is in it shall be impure, | Pesachim 20b:1 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to creeping animals: “And every earthenware vessel into which any of them falls, <b>whatever is in it shall be impure,</b> and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33). <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“From all food</b> in it which may be eaten, upon which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). This indicates that <b>food is rendered impure by the airspace of an earthenware vessel, but not all vessels are rendered impure by the airspace of an earthenware vessel.</b> This <i>baraita</i> proves that the earthenware vessel itself is not considered to be filled with carcasses of creeping animals, and therefore it does not render everything inside it impure with first-degree impurity. Were the earthenware vessel indeed considered as if it were filled with impurity, vessels inside it would also assume first-degree ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | “And every earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [ yitma ], | Sotah 27b:6 | § <b>On that same day</b> that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya was appointed head of the Sanhedrin, <b>Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verse: <b>“And every earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>],</b> and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33), as follows: The verse <b>does not state: Is impure [<i>tamei</i>],</b> but <b>rather: “Shall be impure,”</b> in order <b>to</b> indicate that not only does the vessel itself become ritually impure, but it can now <b>render other</b> items <b>ritually impure.</b> This <b>teaches with regard to a loaf</b> that has <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity status due to its being placed inside an earthenware vessel that had first-degree impurity, <b>that it can render</b> other food with which it comes into contact <b>impure</b> with <b>third-</b>degree impurity status. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | “And every earthen vessel | Sotah 29a:13 | § It is stated in the mishna: <b>On that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the phrase “shall be impure” in the verse: <b>“And every earthen vessel</b> into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>], and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33), as indicating that a loaf that has second-degree ritual impurity can render other food with which it comes into contact impure with third-degree impurity. Rabbi Yehoshua related that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai had predicted that a future generation would purify a loaf that contracted third-degree impurity, as there is no explicit verse in the Torah stating that this degree of impurity exists. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | whose interior | Zevachim 3a:12 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to ritually impure carcasses of creeping animals: “And every earthen vessel into <b>whose interior</b> any of them falls, anything that is in its interior shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:33). From the word “interior” it is derived that only food in its interior is rendered impure, <b>but not</b> any food that is in <b>the interior of its interior,</b> i.e., in another vessel within the earthenware vessel. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> not only if the inner vessel is an earthenware vessel; <b>even</b> if it is a metal or wooden <b>vessel,</b> which is purified though <b>rinsing</b> in a ritual bath and is therefore susceptible to impurity from its exterior, it nevertheless <b>protects</b> food that is inside it from being rendered impure. Evidently, even a vessel that is not of the same type serves to nullify the status of the interior of an earthenware vessel. |
| Leviticus 11:33 | Whose interior [ tokho ], is written four | Zevachim 3b:17 | <b>And</b> Rav Ḥaviva <b>resolves</b> the contradiction as follows: The expression: <b>Whose interior [<i>tokho</i>], is written four</b> times. In other words, in the verse: “And every earthen vessel into whose interior [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls, anything that is in its interior [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:33), the word <i>tokho</i> is mentioned twice, and each time, the verse could have written: The interior. Since the possessive: Its, is added to each instance, the verse is interpreted exegetically as though the word interior [<i>tokh</i>] were mentioned four times: <b>Interior [<i>tokh</i>], whose interior [<i>tokho</i>], interior [<i>tokh</i>],</b> and <b>its interior [<i>tokho</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | as it is written: “All food therein that may be eaten [ ha’okhel asher ye’akhel ], | Bekhorot 9b:23 | <b>And Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> that an item from which deriving benefit is prohibited is not susceptible to the impurity of food? It is <b>as it is written: “All food therein that may be eaten [<i>ha’okhel asher ye’akhel</i>],</b> that on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The use of the Hebrew root <i>alef</i>, <i>khaf</i>, <i>lamed</i> twice in this phrase indicates that specifically <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>is called food</b> with regard to susceptibility to the impurity of food. But food <b>that you are not able to feed to others is not called food.</b> Therefore, an item from which deriving benefit is prohibited and which one is consequently forbidden to feed to gentiles is not considered food in this context. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “From all food which may be eaten, | Chullin 129a:17 | <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to impurity as food: <b>“From all food which may be eaten,</b> that on which water comes shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The repetitive phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that only <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> including gentiles, <b>is called food</b> with regard to being susceptible to impurity as food, but <b>food that you are not able to feed</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “From all food which may be eaten, | Chullin 129b:5 | <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The reason is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to impurity as food: <b>“From all food which may be eaten,</b> that on which water comes shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that only <b>food that you can feed to others,</b> including gentiles, <b>is called food</b> in this regard, but <b>food that you cannot feed to others,</b> such as the limb and flesh from a living animal, <b>is not called food.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “From all food which may be eaten, | Chullin 129b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The reason is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to impurity as food: <b>“From all food which may be eaten,</b> that on which water comes shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that only <b>food that you can feed to others,</b> including gentiles, <b>is called food</b> with regard to being susceptible to impurity as food, but <b>food that you cannot feed to others,</b> such as flesh from a living animal, which is forbidden even to gentiles, <b>is not called food.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “Of all food that may be eaten, | Chullin 36a:13 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“Of all food that may be eaten,</b> on which water comes, it shall be impure; and all drink that may be drunk it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). From that verse it is derived: <b>Food that comes into</b> contact with <b>water is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity and to count the descending levels of impurity, but <b>food that does not come into</b> contact with <b>water is not rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. Apparently, for the dry portion of flour that did not come into contact with a liquid but was rendered susceptible by regard for sanctity, one does not count the descending levels of impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “Of all food which may be eaten, | Chullin 36a:15 | The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who cited the verse to resolve the dilemma of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, is not merely citing a verse that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish knows. Rather, he <b>too is stating</b> his proof <b>from the extraneous</b> formulation <b>of the verses. Since it is written: “But when water is placed upon the seed,</b> and any of their carcass falls upon it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“Of all food which may be eaten,</b> on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34)? |
| Leviticus 11:34 | wood and frankincense edible | Chullin 36b:13 | <b>Rather</b> the proof is <b>from the latter</b> portion of that verse: “And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. <b>And the flesh,</b> every pure person may eat flesh” (Leviticus 7:19). The Gemara explains: The second mention of the term “and the flesh” in the verse is superfluous and serves <b>to include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that with regard to sacred <b>wood and frankincense,</b> impurity disqualifies them from being burned on the altar. Are <b>wood and frankincense edible</b> and therefore included in the verse: “Of all food that may be eaten, on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34)? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish derived from this that <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>and renders their</b> status like that of <b>food. Here too,</b> in the case of a dry portion of flour that was not mixed with the oil of meal offerings, <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> it <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “All food which may be eaten [ ha’okhel asher ye’akhel ], | Menachot 101b:3 | <b>And Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion that an item from which it is prohibited to derive benefit is not susceptible to impurity of food? It is because it is stated: <b>“All food which may be eaten [<i>ha’okhel asher ye’akhel</i>],</b> that on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The redundancy in the phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that specifically <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> in this case, gentiles, <b>is termed food</b> for the purposes of susceptibility to the impurity of food, but <b>food that you are not able to feed to others is not termed food.</b> Therefore, items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit and which it is therefore prohibited to feed to others are not considered food in this context. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | hear: “And all drink that may be drunk in any vessel shall be impure” | Pesachim 16a:11 | The Gemara cites several sources to decide the dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> and between Rav and Shmuel with regard to whether or not the impurity of liquids is by Torah law. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “And all drink that may be drunk in any vessel shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:34). This verse clearly indicates that liquids can become impure. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Shall be impure,</b> in this context? It means that the liquid <b>renders</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | verse: “From all food that may be eaten, | Pesachim 16a:12 | The Gemara retorts: Does it in fact mean that the liquid <b>renders</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? That cannot be as <b>you</b> already <b>learned</b> that <b>from the beginning of</b> this <b>verse: “From all food that may be eaten,</b> on which water has come shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, the second part of the verse is also necessary: <b>One</b> part of the verse, the latter part, is referring <b>to</b> water <b>detached</b> from its source, in vessels, <b>and one</b> part, the former part, is referring <b>to</b> water still <b>attached</b> to its source in the ground. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | and all drink that may be drunk in every vessel, shall be impure [ yitma ]” | Pesachim 18a:8 | The Gemara inquires: <b>And here,</b> with regard to the ritual impurity of liquids, <b>how does</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>interpret</b> the verses? The Gemara cites the verse: “From all food which may be eaten, upon which water has come, shall be impure; <b>and all drink that may be drunk in every vessel, shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:34). Rabbi Yosei interprets the end of the verse as: <b>Shall render impure [<i>yetamme</i>],</b> indicating that liquid also <b>transmits impurity to foods.</b> The Gemara discusses this derivation: Do <b>you say</b> that this expression teaches that liquid <b>transmits ritual impurity to foods, or perhaps</b> the verse <b>is</b> teaching <b>only</b> that <b>it transmits impurity to</b> other <b>liquids,</b> but not to food? <b>You said</b> in response: <b>That was not</b> the correct interpretation. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “From all food which may be eaten, upon which water has come, shall be impure” | Pesachim 18b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>How does</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>interpret</b> the term: <b>Shall be impure, in the first</b> portion of the verse: <b>“From all food which may be eaten, upon which water has come, shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:34)? He interprets the term: <b>Shall be impure,</b> as: Shall render impure. Food <b>transmits ritual impurity to liquids.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the term teaches that food <b>transmits impurity to liquids, or perhaps</b> the term teaches <b>only</b> that food <b>transmits impurity to a vessel?</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “From all food | Pesachim 20b:1 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to creeping animals: “And every earthenware vessel into which any of them falls, <b>whatever is in it shall be impure,</b> and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33). <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“From all food</b> in it which may be eaten, upon which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). This indicates that <b>food is rendered impure by the airspace of an earthenware vessel, but not all vessels are rendered impure by the airspace of an earthenware vessel.</b> This <i>baraita</i> proves that the earthenware vessel itself is not considered to be filled with carcasses of creeping animals, and therefore it does not render everything inside it impure with first-degree impurity. Were the earthenware vessel indeed considered as if it were filled with impurity, vessels inside it would also assume first-degree ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:34 | with regard to this: “All food that is eaten | Shabbat 138b:13 | The Gemara asks: How is it possible that they will be unable to understand <b>whether</b> the loaf <b>is ritually pure or whether it is ritually impure? It is explicitly written</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to this: “All food that is eaten</b> upon which water falls shall contract impurity, and all liquid drunk in any vessel shall contract impurity” (Leviticus 11:34). There can be no doubt as to the question of whether or not the loaf can become impure. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains: The woman seeks <b>to ascertain whether it</b> assumes <b>first-</b>degree ritual impurity status <b>or whether it</b> assumes second-degree ritual impurity status; <b>and there</b> will be <b>none</b> who <b>understands.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | “And every liquid that is drunk | Shabbat 14b:3 | <b>And</b> among the decrees that were listed, there is also the decree concerning the impurity of <b>the foods that became impure</b> through contact <b>with liquids.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With liquids that</b> became impure due to contact with <b>what</b> source of impurity? <b>If you say</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal, they are</b> impure <b>by Torah law, as it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of creeping animals: <b>“And every liquid that is drunk</b> in any vessel, will be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>due to</b> contact with impure <b>hands.</b> The Sages issued this <b>decree due to liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>through</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:34 | the volume of an egg-bulk? Rabbi Abbahu said that Rabbi Elazar said that the verse states: “Of all food [ okhel ] which may be eaten [ ye’akhel ], | Yoma 80a:3 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the measure for <b>impure foods</b> is <b>the volume of an egg-bulk? Rabbi Abbahu said that Rabbi Elazar said that the verse states: “Of all food [<i>okhel</i>] which may be eaten [<i>ye’akhel</i>],</b> on which water comes shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The double usage of the root <i>akhal</i> teaches that the ritual impurity of food applies even to the amount which can be described as <b>food that comes on account of food,</b> i.e., food that comes from another food. <b>And which</b> food <b>is that? A chicken egg.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> it is referring to <b>a kid,</b> which comes from a mother goat, and is therefore also food that comes from another food. The Gemara answers: <b>It lacks ritual slaughter.</b> The young goat is not yet food, since it is not edible until it has been slaughtered. The Gemara asks further: <b>And say</b> it is referring to <b>a <i>ben pekua</i>.</b> Since the slaughter of its mother made it fit to eat, the fetus itself need not be slaughtered, even if it survives and continues to live independently of its mother. The Gemara answers: The calf still <b>requires cutting,</b> since it cannot be eaten live, but it does not require ritual slaughter. |
| Leviticus 11:35 | an oven, or a range for pots, it shall be broken | Chullin 118a:14 | The Gemara explains: There is <b>an additional</b> derivation with regard to <b>a handle,</b> as <b>it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of vessels: “And everything upon which any part of their carcass falls shall be impure; whether <b>an oven, or a range for pots, it shall be broken</b> in pieces; they are impure, and shall be impure for you” (Leviticus 11:35). |
| Leviticus 11:35 | of their carcass | Chullin 74a:4 | § <b>Rava said: From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived: The <b>death</b> of an animal by means other than slaughter <b>renders</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the slaughter, whereas the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>does not render</b> a limb as though it had already <b>fallen off? As it is written</b> with regard to the eight species of impure creeping animals: <b>“And anything that these fall upon, when they are dead, it shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:32). <b>What</b> does the term “when they are dead” serve <b>to exclude? If we say</b> it serves <b>to exclude</b> the time <b>when they are alive,</b> that principle is <b>derived from:</b> “And everything upon which any part <b>of their carcass</b> falls shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:35), which explicitly states that only their carcasses impart impurity. <b>Rather, learn from</b> the verse that <b>death renders</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off,</b> and <b>slaughter does not render</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:36 | The verse states: “But a spring or a cistern, or a gathering of water shall be pure” | Chullin 84a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the verse equates the blood of a domesticated animal with water, then let one <b>immerse</b> ritually impure items <b>in it</b> to purify them, just as he can immerse them in water. The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “But a spring or a cistern, or a gathering of water shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:36). The exclusionary term: “But,” indicates that only concerning <b>these</b> bodies of water, <b>yes,</b> they render pure an impure item, while <b>something else,</b> e.g., blood, does <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:36 | it is written: “Nevertheless a fountain | Nazir 64a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon, what is the reason</b> for his opinion? <b>Ulla said</b> that as <b>it is written: “Nevertheless a fountain</b> or a cistern in which there is a gathering of water shall be pure” (Leviticus 11:36), this indicates that a creeping animal found in one of these places does not impart impurity. <b>And it is written</b> in the same verse: “He who touches their carcass <b>shall be impure</b> until evening,” which indicates that it does render one impure. <b>How so?</b> If the impurity was <b>floating</b> in water contained <b>in vessels,</b> the item it touched <b>is</b> rendered <b>impure,</b> but if the water was <b>in the ground</b> itself, e.g., in a spring or pit, the item it touched is <b>pure.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:36 | hear: “However, a spring or a cistern, a gathering of water shall be pure, | Pesachim 16a:15 | The Gemara cites another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “However, a spring or a cistern, a gathering of water shall be pure,</b> but he who touches their carcass shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:36). It can be inferred from this verse that all water can be rendered impure, with the exception of spring water and water in a cistern, which are in the ground. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Shall be pure”?</b> This phrase means that one who immerses in this water is purified <b>from his ritual impurity,</b> and does not refer to the impurity of liquids at all. |
| Leviticus 11:36 | As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Abba: The verse states: “Nevertheless a fountain or a cistern wherein is a gathering of water shall be pure” | Zevachim 25b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Abba: The verse states: “Nevertheless a fountain or a cistern wherein is a gathering of water shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:36). The verse indicates that <b>their being must be by way of purity,</b> i.e., the gathering of the water must not be accomplished by way of items susceptible to impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:37 | matter of protection in general | Chullin 118b:1 | The Gemara asks: Why is it assumed that if the verse is not needed for the matter of protection of a carcass, it should be applied to the matter of a handle in general? <b>Say</b> that <b>if</b> the verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of protection of a carcass, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of protection in general</b> with regard to food. Although it is already written: “Upon any sowing seed” (Leviticus 11:37), two verses are necessary to teach the <i>halakha</i> of protection with regard to food: One verse to teach that <b>protection imports</b> impurity <b>and</b> one to teach that <b>protection joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> source from which to derive that <b>a handle imports</b> impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:37 | “On any sowing seed that is sown” | Chullin 119a:18 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to the impurity of food the verse states: <b>“On any sowing seed that is sown”</b> (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to impurity when it is in a state where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field for sowing: This applies to <b>wheat in its shell, and barley in its shell, and lentils in their shells.</b> It is derived from here that shells and other appendages that protect the food are considered part of the food. Since wheat, barley, and lentil grains are smaller than a bean-bulk, this statement indicates that even protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food imparts impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and Rav. |
| Leviticus 11:37 | “On any sowing seed that is sown” | Chullin 119b:9 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to the impurity of food the verse states: <b>“On any sowing seed that is sown”</b> (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to ritual impurity when it is in a state where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field <b>for sowing:</b> This applies to <b>wheat in its shell, and barley in its shell, and lentils in their shells.</b> It is derived from here that shells and other appendages that protect the food join together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. Since the measure of one grain and its shell is less than an egg-bulk, this statement must be discussing multiple grains and their shells joined together. Evidently, protection of food that is divided into separate sections joins together to impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:37 | fall | Chullin 127b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the limb <b>will not heal, and</b> the reason that the limb does not impart impurity of a carcass is that <b>the impurity of a carcass is different</b> and unique, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass: “And <b>if</b> any of their carcass <b>fall</b> upon any sowing seed” (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the severed limb of an animal is not considered a carcass <b>until it</b> completely <b>falls</b> from the animal. |
| Leviticus 11:37 | “Upon any sowing seed which is to be sown” | Keritot 21a:24 | Rav raised a difficulty to Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>If so,</b> that less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass does not transmit impurity, <b>it should also require</b> contact with a liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity as a food. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that with regard to the impurity of foods, the verse states: <b>“Upon any sowing seed which is to be sown”</b> (Leviticus 11:37), which teaches: <b>Just as seeds are unique</b> in <b>that they will not ultimately become impure</b> with <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity and</b> they <b>require</b> contact with liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>so too, anything that will not ultimately become impure</b> with <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity requires</b> contact with liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:37 | upon any sowing seed that is sown, | Shabbat 95b:1 | is with regard <b>to rendering seeds capable</b> of becoming ritually impure. Seeds that are in a perforated pot have the legal status of seeds planted in the ground and, as such, cannot become ritually impure. Seeds that are in an imperforated pot are considered detached from the ground and can become ritually impure. Apparently, in other areas of <i>halakha</i>, Rabbi Shimon holds that a plant in a perforated pot has the legal status of a plant in the ground (<i>Me’iri</i>). He <b>said to him: With</b> regard to <b>all matters</b> of <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Shimon equates</b> the status of a perforated pot <b>with</b> that of being <b>detached.</b> However, <b>the matter of impurity is different, as the Torah amplified purity with regard to seeds, as it is stated:</b> “And if anything falls from their carcasses <b>upon any sowing seed that is sown,</b> it is pure” (Leviticus 11:37). The repetitive language: “Any sowing seed that is sown” teaches that any seed that can be characterized as sowing, including one growing in a perforated pot, remains pure. However, in other areas of <i>halakha</i>, the status of a perforated pot is equal to that of an imperforated pot. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | with regard to the seeds | Bava Batra66b:4 | § <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>rainwater</b> that was falling and the owner consciously <b>desired</b> that it should fall <b>so that it would wash</b> his immovable <b>lower millstones, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the seeds</b> in the millstones? The verse “But if any water be put upon the seed…it shall be unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:38) teaches that seeds and other food become susceptible to ritual purity only after they have been detached from the ground, and water, or another of the seven liquids specified in the mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:4), has been put on them. The food must be exposed to the liquid willfully by the owner; that is, he must desire or at least be pleased that the food should become wet. Rav Yosef asks about a case where the owner wants the rain to fall on the millstones: Does that water make the seeds upon which it falls susceptible to ritual impurity? |
| Leviticus 11:38 | of Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa raised a contradiction: | Bava Metzia22b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>too,</b> the produce should not be rendered susceptible to contracting impurity, because the dew fell on the produce and was not placed there by the owner. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa raised a contradiction:</b> The verse states: “But when water is placed [<i>vekhi yuttan</i>] upon the seed, and any part of a carcass falls thereon, it is ritually impure unto you” (Leviticus 11:38). The word “<i>yuttan</i>” <b>is written</b> in the defective form, as if it says <b>“<i>ki yitten</i>.”</b> Accordingly, this would mean that one must actively place the water on the produce. Yet, <b>we read</b> it, based on the tradition as to its correct pronunciation, as if it is written <b>“<i>ki yuttan</i>,”</b> which includes any situation where the produce becomes wet. <b>How so?</b> How can the way the verse is written and the way it is read be reconciled? |
| Leviticus 11:38 | “But if water is put on the seed, and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” | Chullin 118a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> that <b>handles</b> are susceptible to and impart impurity <b>written?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of food: <b>“But if water is put on the seed, and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you”</b> (Leviticus 11:38). It is derived from the term <b>“for you”</b> that <b>any</b> part <b>needed for your</b> use of the food is susceptible to impurity and imparts impurity, <b>including the handles</b> that facilitate the consumption of the food. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | Rather, | Chullin 118b:2 | The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that a handle imports impurity is not derived from the superfluous verse written with regard to the impurity of a carcass. <b>Rather,</b> it is necessary to return to the explanation that was initially proposed, i.e., that it is written with regard to the impurity of food: “It is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is derived that any part needed for your use of the food imparts impurity, including handles. It was asked with regard to this derivation: Say that this verse teaches that a handle exports impurity but not that it imports impurity. The Gemara suggests: That question is not difficult. <b>From the outset, when</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle is written:</b> “But if water is put upon the seed, and any of their carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), <b>it is written</b> in the context <b>of importing</b> impurity. Therefore, it is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> that a handle exports impurity from the <i>halakha</i> that it imports impurity, and it is derived <i>a fortiori</i> from the <i>halakhot</i> of a handle that protection both imports and exports impurity. It is also derived that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity from that which is written: “On any sowing seed.” |
| Leviticus 11:38 | “But if water is put upon the seed, | Chullin 121a:18 | The Gemara now explains the source of this principle. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael teaches:</b> With regard to rendering food susceptible to impurity through contact with liquid, the verse states: <b>“But if water is put upon the seed,</b> and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38). <b>Just as seeds, which will never contract</b> a more <b>severe</b> level of <b>impurity,</b> because no form of severe impurity applies to foods other than meat, <b>require</b> contact with liquid to <b>render</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to their less severe level of impurity, <b>so too any</b> food <b>that will never contract</b> a more <b>severe</b> level of <b>impurity requires</b> contact with liquid to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity of food. By contrast, any food that will become impure with a more severe level of impurity does not require contact with liquid to be rendered susceptible to impurity of food. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | is placed | Chullin 13a:4 | Rabbi Ami asked: But with regard to <b>this</b> matter, <b>too, Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> already <b>said</b> a conclusive resolution <b>one time, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:1): In the case of <b>one who takes his produce up to the roof</b> to protect it <b>from insects, and dew fell upon it,</b> the produce <b>is not in</b> the category of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is derived that produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was agreeable to its dampening. <b>And if</b> after taking the produce up to the roof <b>he intended</b> that the produce would be dampened by dew, the produce <b>is in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” |
| Leviticus 11:38 | is placed | Chullin 16a:7 | With regard <b>to the matter of rendering seeds susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, there <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:3): In the case of <b>one who places a bowl on the wall</b> while it is raining <b>so that</b> the bowl <b>will be rinsed</b> with the rainwater, if the water from the bowl then falls onto produce, <b>that is under</b> the rubric of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38). The water has the halakhic status of a liquid that he poured of his own volition on fruit and seeds. Consequently, it renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. But if he placed the bowl there <b>so that the wall will not be damaged, it is not under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” Since he had no intent to use the water, it is not considered to have entered the bowl of his own volition, and it does not render produce susceptible to impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | of the verses. Since it is written: “But when water is placed upon the seed, | Chullin 36a:15 | The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who cited the verse to resolve the dilemma of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, is not merely citing a verse that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish knows. Rather, he <b>too is stating</b> his proof <b>from the extraneous</b> formulation <b>of the verses. Since it is written: “But when water is placed upon the seed,</b> and any of their carcass falls upon it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“Of all food which may be eaten,</b> on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34)? |
| Leviticus 11:38 | be put. | Eruvin 87b:20 | The Gemara clarifies this <i>baraita</i>: <b>They may draw water through</b> a hole cut out of <b>a balcony on Shabbat</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that we stated</b> above. <b>And they may insulate</b> produce <b>in the pods</b> of legumes; <b>what is</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>rose early</b> in the morning <b>to bring residue</b> from the field, e.g., the straw of wheat or the stalks or pods of legumes, in order to store his produce in them, the following distinction applies: <b>If</b> he rose early <b>because</b> the residue still <b>has dew on it,</b> and he wants to use this moisture for his produce, <b>this</b> instance <b>is considered</b> to be in the following category: <b>If</b> any water <b>be put.</b> Food or produce can contract ritual impurity only if it has come into contact with a liquid, either directly through the action of its owner, or without his direct intervention but with his approval. This is derived from the verse: “But if any water be put on the seed, and any part of their carcass falls on it, it shall be unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:38). Returning to our issue, if this person rose early because the residue still has dew on it, the produce he stores in it is rendered susceptible to ritual impurity, as it has come into contact with the dew with its owner’s approval. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | be put | Keritot 15b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 1:5): With regard to <b>one who</b> forcefully <b>wipes</b> rainwater from the surface of <b>a leek or squeezes out</b> water absorbed <b>in his hair or in his clothing, the liquid that</b> remains <b>within it is not</b> included <b>under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be put</b> upon the seed, and some of their carcass fall on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38). Therefore, it cannot render food susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. <b>But</b> the liquid <b>that is released from it,</b> in this process of wiping or squeezing, <b>is</b> included <b>under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be put,”</b> and therefore it renders any food it touches susceptible to ritual impurity, as the person has accorded it significance. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | of Rav Pappa. As Rav Pappa raises a contradiction: | Kiddushin 59b:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>Thought</b> in the case <b>of ritual impurity is different, as</b> it <b>is considered like action, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa. As Rav Pappa raises a contradiction:</b> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that produce must become wet in order for it to contract ritual impurity, the verse states: “But if water is placed [<i>vekhi yuttan</i>] upon the seed, and any part of a carcass falls upon it, it is impure” (Leviticus 11:38). The word <i>yuttan</i> is written defective, and <b>is written</b> as if it says <b><i>ki yitten</i>.</b> Accordingly, this would mean that one must actively place the water on the produce. Yet <b>we read</b> it, based on the tradition as to its correct pronunciation, <b>“<i>ki yuttan</i>,”</b> which includes any situation where the produce becomes wet. <b>How so?</b> How can the way the verse is written and the way it is read be reconciled? |
| Leviticus 11:38 | of a carcass falls upon it, it is impure” | Pesachim 14a:9 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t</b> there a principle that <b>food does not transmit ritual impurity to</b> other <b>food, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>food transmits impurity to</b> other <b>food;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And if water is placed upon the seed, and any</b> part <b>of a carcass falls upon it, it is impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:38). The Sages derived from this verse: <b>It,</b> the food exposed to the source of impurity, <b>is impure, but it does not render similar</b> foods <b>impure.</b> Apparently, food does not transmit impurity to other food. |
| Leviticus 11:38 | derived from there: “But if water is put upon the seed, and any of their carcass falls upon it, it is impure for you” | Pesachim 18b:8 | <b>Is</b> the principle: <b>Shall be impure</b> teaches <b>that</b> ritual impurity <b>does not render a similar</b> item impure, e.g., that food does not transfer ritual impurity to other food, <b>derived from here?</b> It is <b>derived from there: “But if water is put upon the seed, and any of their carcass falls upon it, it is impure for you”</b> (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is inferred: <b>It is impure;</b> however, <b>it does not transmit impurity</b> to a <b>similar</b> item. Why is an additional source necessary to teach this same principle? The Gemara explains: Both verses are necessary, as <b>one</b> refers <b>to liquids that come to</b> a state of impurity <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal,</b> while <b>one</b> verse refers <b>to liquids that come to</b> a state of impurity <b>due to</b> contact with an impure <b>vessel.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:38 | be placed.” | Shabbat 11b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> even that <i>zav</i> <b>need</b> the pouch <b>so that his clothes will not get soiled</b> by the emission? Although he does not need the pouch for a halakhic determination, he needs it for practical considerations. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This <i>tanna</i> is</b> the <b>one who said that any</b> usage intended <b>to prevent filth is not considered</b> a special purpose that will render a certain object an actual vessel. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who places a bowl on the wall</b> while it is raining, <b>if</b> he did that <b>so that the bowl would be rinsed</b> with the rainwater, <b>that is under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be placed.”</b> The water has the legal status of a liquid that he poured of his own volition on fruit and seeds. It renders them liable to become ritually impure, as it is written: “If water be placed upon seed and any of their carcass fell on it, it is impure to you” (Leviticus 11:38). However, <b>if</b> he placed the bowl <b>so</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | its carcass | Chullin 117b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>protection does not</b> join together with the food <b>with regard to a severe</b> level of <b>impurity?</b> The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the impurity of a carcass, the verse states: “And if any animal of which you may eat dies, one who touches <b>its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). This indicates that only one who touches the flesh of the carcass becomes impure, <b>but</b> one who touches the <b>hide</b> of the carcass <b>upon which there is not an olive-bulk of flesh</b> does <b>not</b> become impure. |
| Leviticus 11:39 | shall be impure | Chullin 118a:1 | One <b>might</b> have thought that only one who touches the flesh of the carcass becomes impure, but <b>one who touches the external</b> side of the hide of the carcass that is <b>aligned with the flesh,</b> but does not touch the flesh itself, <b>does not become impure.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “One who touches its carcass <b>shall be impure</b> until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). It is derived from the term “shall be impure” that even one who touches the hide in this manner becomes impure. |
| Leviticus 11:39 | dies, | Chullin 118a:8 | <b>And</b> furthermore <b>it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass: <b>“And if any animal which is for you</b> to consume <b>dies,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The term <b>“for you”</b> indicates that <b>any</b> part <b>needed for your</b> use of the carcass imparts impurity, <b>including the handles.</b> One who touches the handle of an item that is impure with impurity of a carcass becomes impure as though he touched the carcass itself. These two verses teach that <b>a handle</b> transmits impurity both <b>with regard to importing</b> impurity into the attached food <b>and with regard to exporting</b> impurity from the attached food. |
| Leviticus 11:39 | protection with regard to a carcass, | Chullin 118b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection with regard to a carcass,</b> as it is written: “Shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:39)? The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for the matter itself,</b> to teach that the <i>halakha</i> of protection is applicable to the impurity of a carcass. |
| Leviticus 11:39 | the Sages taught | Chullin 126b:5 | §The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal,</b> one who touches them when they are sealed remains ritually pure, because the bone itself does not impart impurity. With regard to this topic, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “One who touches the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The word <b>“carcass”</b> indicates that one who touches the carcass is impure, <b>but</b> one who touches <b>a sealed thigh bone is not.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | dies, | Chullin 128b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived <b>that a limb</b> severed <b>from the living imparts impurity? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the impurity of a carcass it is written: <b>“And if some animal [<i>min habehema</i>]</b> of which you may eat <b>dies,</b> he who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The phrase “some animal [<i>min habehema</i>],” which also means: From an animal, is interpreted as indicating that a limb torn from an animal is included in the impurity discussed in the verse. |
| Leviticus 11:39 | as it is written: “And if any animal of which you may eat dies, one who touches its carcass | Chullin 37a:6 | The Gemara rejects that proof. <b>And</b> that is not a legitimate inference, as <b>perhaps</b> the halakhic status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass is</b> the same as <b>that of</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, and the prohibition: “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass,” includes both. The Gemara answers: <b>It would not enter your mind</b> to say so, <b>as it is written: “And if any animal of which you may eat dies, one who touches its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). This indicates that <b>it is after death that the Merciful One calls</b> the animal <b>a carcass; while alive,</b> the animal <b>is not called a carcass.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | says: I said [ namti ] to ben Azzai: We learned that a carcass of a kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity | Chullin 70b:12 | § It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> a student of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says: I said [<i>namti</i>] to ben Azzai: We learned that a carcass of a kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity</b> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). <b>And</b> we learned that <b>a carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> and <b>that a carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> from the verse: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal” (Leviticus 5:2). |
| Leviticus 11:39 | I said to him | Chullin 70b:15 | <b>I said to him</b> that Rabbi Yishmael derives all these <i>halakhot</i> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39), as follows: <b>“And when a domesticated animal [<i>habehema</i>] dies,” this</b> is referring to <b>a non-kosher animal; “of those that you eat,” this</b> is referring to <b>a kosher animal.</b> And <b>we learned</b> that <b>a <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>behema</i>,</b> i.e., the term <i>behema</i> can also refer collectively to both domesticated and undomesticated animals. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>a <i>behema</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | the verse states: | Chullin 70b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a rationale for this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a kosher animal; from where do we</b> derive that the same applies to <b>a non-kosher animal?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The Gemara interprets the verse as follows: <b>“And when a domesticated animal dies,” this</b> is referring to <b>a non-kosher animal; “of those that you eat,” this</b> is referring to <b>a kosher animal.</b> The verse thereby <b>juxtaposes a non-kosher animal to a kosher animal</b> with regard to imparting impurity of a carcass, and teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a kosher animal, its fetus</b> that died in its womb is <b>pure,</b> as derived above through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, its</b> dead <b>fetus</b> is <b>pure.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | dies, | Chullin 74a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to that <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>who does use</b> it <b>as a refutation, from where does he</b> derive <b>that the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders it pure</b> from having the impurity of a carcass? The Gemara answers that he <b>derives it from that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if some domesticated animal,</b> of which you may eat, <b>dies,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The word “some” teaches that only <b>some</b> dead <b>animals impart impurity</b> as a carcass, <b>but some</b> dead <b>animals do not impart impurity</b> as a carcass. <b>And what is</b> it <b>that</b> does not impart impurity? <b>That is a <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | its carcass | Chullin 77b:3 | With regard to <b>the ritual impurity of animal carcasses also, we</b> already <b>learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches <b>its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The verse indicates that one is rendered impure if he touches its carcass, <b>but not</b> if he touches its <b>hide, and not its bones, and not</b> its <b>sinews, and not</b> its <b>horns, and not</b> its <b>hooves.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | “And if there dies of the animals | Chullin 85b:7 | The Gemara addresses the second statement of Rabbi Abba: <b>And not with regard to all</b> <i>halakhot</i> did <b>Rabbi Shimon say</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> as <b>Rabbi Shimon concedes that</b> such an act of slaughter <b>renders</b> the animal <b>pure from</b> having the impure status of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious? As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The verse states with regard to an animal carcass: <b>“And if there dies of the animals</b>…he that touches its carcass shall be unclean” (Leviticus 11:39). The word “of” indicates that <b>some animals transmit impurity</b> as a carcass <b>and some animals do not transmit impurity. And which</b> animal does not? <b>That is a <i>tereifa</i> that</b> one <b>slaughtered.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | dies, | Niddah 56a:15 | The carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> transmits impurity only when moist, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Whoever touches them <b>when they are dead</b> shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31). This indicates that they transmit impurity when they are in a state <b>similar to</b> their state at the time of <b>death,</b> when creatures are still moist. <b>Semen</b> transmits impurity only when moist, as it must be <b>fit to inseminate. An animal carcass</b> transmits impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> any animal of which you may eat <b>dies,</b> he who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39), which teaches that the carcass transmits impurity when it is in a state <b>similar to</b> its state at the time of <b>death.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:39 | “And if any animal of which you may eat shall die, | Shabbat 136a:5 | <b>Abaye said:</b> The issue of whether a child who has not yet survived thirty days from his birth is considered viable is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to the interpretation of the verse: <b>“And if any animal of which you may eat shall die,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The verse is interpreted as coming <b>to include offspring of eight</b> months. Large domesticated animals typically give birth after a gestation period of nine months. If an animal of that sort gives birth after eight months, its offspring is deemed to be not viable and <b>its slaughter does not purify it.</b> Rather, it assumes the status of an unslaughtered animal, which is not only prohibited to be eaten, but also transmits ritual impurity to those who touch or move it. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, say: Its slaughter purifies it,</b> and it does not assume unslaughtered animal status. |
| Leviticus 11:39 | dies, | Zevachim 69b:13 | <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The verse concerning the impurity of carcasses states: <b>“And if some animal,</b> of which you may eat, <b>dies,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:39)? The word “some” teaches that <b>some animals impart impurity</b> and <b>some animals do not impart impurity. And what is</b> it <b>that</b> does not impart impurity? <b>That is a <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered.</b> And if even its meat does not impart impurity, the word <i>tereifa</i> is not needed to teach that its forbidden fat is pure. |
| Leviticus 11:40 | it is written: | Chullin 124b:19 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason?</b> With regard to impurity transmitted by carrying <b>it is written:</b> “And one who carries [<i>vahannosei</i>] its carcass shall wash his clothes and be impure until evening” (Leviticus 11:40). The words “and who carries” in the term “and one who carries” is <b>written</b> <i>vav</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>sin</i>, <i>alef</i>, which can be read <b><i>venisa</i>,</b> meaning: Is carried; <b>but</b> according to the traditional vocalization <b>we read</b> the word as <b><i>nosei</i>,</b> meaning: Carries. From here it is derived that with regard to impurity transmitted by carrying <b>we require</b> that one <b>carry [<i>nosei</i>]</b> the requisite measure of impurity of a carcass, i.e., an olive-bulk, <b>and that</b> that olive-bulk <b>be capable of being carried [<i>nissa</i>] all at once,</b> without the assistance of a utensil. This requirement is not met with regard to two half olive-bulks that one skewered with a wood chip, which are carried only with the assistance of a utensil. |
| Leviticus 11:40 | As it is written: “And one who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes, | Chullin 71a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>an encapsulated impure</b> item does not impart impurity? <b>As it is written: “And one who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes,</b> and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:40), i.e., he must immerse his body and garments in a ritual bath, and he then becomes pure at sunset. <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with a case <b>where one ate</b> from the carcass <b>close to sunset</b> and then immersed? <b>And</b> yet <b>the Merciful One states</b> that he is <b>pure</b> once the sun sets, despite the fact that his stomach still contains pieces of the carcass that have not yet been digested. If so, it is apparent that an encapsulated impure item does not impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 11:40 | “And he who eats | Niddah 42b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to an animal carcass: <b>“And he who eats</b> of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:40), which indicates that an animal carcass does impart impurity by means of consumption? |
| Leviticus 11:41 | of Neresh are not from the settled area, | Chullin 127a:13 | In continuation of the discussion of creatures living in a particular environment, <b>Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua said: The beavers</b> of the region <b>of Neresh are not from the settled area,</b> because they live only in the water and not on dry land. Consequently, one who eats their meat is not liable to receive lashes for violating the prohibition: “And every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). |
| Leviticus 11:41 | is prohibited | Chullin 58a:15 | § <b>Rav Huna says: Any creature that has no bones cannot last twelve months. Rav Pappa said:</b> One may <b>learn from Rav Huna’s</b> statement about <b>that which Shmuel says: If a serpent melon became infested by worms while attached to the ground</b> [<b><i>be’ibbeha</i></b>], the worm <b>is prohibited</b> for consumption, in accordance with the verse: “And every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). |
| Leviticus 11:41 | swarming thing that swarms upon the earth | Chullin 64a:8 | <b>Ravina objects to this: But perhaps it is</b> the egg <b>of a snake,</b> whose carcass does not transmit ritual impurity, even though the albumen and yolk of its eggs are mixed together. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not teach about ritual impurity, but rather <b>that if tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed</b> inside the egg <b>and one ate it, he is flogged on its account, due to</b> the prohibition: “And every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). |
| Leviticus 11:41 | swarming thing that swarms upon the earth | Chullin 67a:11 | § <b>Rav Huna says: A person should not pour beer</b> into a vessel <b>through straw</b> to filter it <b>at night, lest</b> a creeping animal <b>emerge</b> from the beer <b>above the straw and then fall into the cup.</b> Since the drinker poured the beer through a filter, he will assume that all creatures found in the vessel originated there and are permitted despite lacking fins and scales. He will therefore drink the beer along with the creature, <b>and</b> in doing so, he <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “Every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). |
| Leviticus 11:41 | “Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth | Chullin 67a:14 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Huna:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports your</b> statement that one need be concerned only about filtered beer: The verse: <b>“Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:41), serves <b>to include gnats</b> found in liquid <b>that one filtered.</b> One may infer: <b>The reason</b> they are prohibited is <b>because one filtered</b> the liquids, <b>but</b> if one <b>did not filter them,</b> the gnats <b>are permitted.</b> Evidently, one need not be concerned that they emerged from the water onto the side of the vessel. |
| Leviticus 11:41 | every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth | Eruvin 28a:1 | If <b>one ate a <i>putita</i>,</b> a certain water insect, <b>he is given four</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> as he has transgressed four separate negative Torah commandments, two that relate to creeping animals in general and two that relate to water insects in particular. If he ate <b>an ant, he is given five</b> sets of <b>lashes</b> for violating the two general prohibitions and another three negative commandments stated with regard to insects that creep upon the earth. If he ate <b>a hornet, he is given six</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for in addition to the prohibitions applying to an ant, he has transgressed a prohibition stated with regard to flying insects. <b>And if it is</b> correct that something that lives in water is considered as growing from the ground, one who eats <b>a <i>putita</i> should also be given lashes for</b> violating the following prohibition: “And <b>every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). Rather, fish must certainly not be considered as growing from the ground, and therefore this explanation is to be rejected. |
| Leviticus 11:41 | “Creeping animals that creep on the ground… | Makkot 16b:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And one who eats unslaughtered</b> animal or bird <b>carcasses, or <i>tereifot</i>,</b> or <b>repugnant creatures, or creeping animals,</b> is liable to receive lashes. <b>Rav Yehuda says: One who eats a fish-</b>like creature found <b>in</b> the furrows of a field formed by <b>a plow [<i>binnita devei kerava</i>], we flog him due to</b> violation of the prohibition: <b>“Creeping animals that creep on the ground…</b>shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who ate a fish-</b>like creature found <b>in</b> the furrows of a field formed by <b>a plow, and Rav Yehuda flogged him.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:41 | “Creeping animals that creep on the ground… | Makkot 16b:9 | If one ate <b>an ant, he is flogged</b> with <b>five</b> sets of lashes. In addition to the two prohibitions stated with regard to repugnant creatures in general, he is also flogged <b>for</b> violating the prohibitions: <b>“Creeping animals that creep on the ground…</b>shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41), and: “And all creeping animals that creep on the ground, you shall not eat them” (Leviticus 11:42), and: “Neither shall you render yourselves impure with any manner of creeping things that crawls upon the ground” (Leviticus 11:44). |
| Leviticus 11:41 | with regard to them. | Meilah 16b:1 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>eating creeping animals,</b> one <b>is flogged for</b> eating <b>an olive-bulk</b> of them. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because the term <b>“eating” is written</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to them.</b> The verse states: “And every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). The term “eating” is invariably referring to consuming an olive-bulk. |
| Leviticus 11:41 | is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 23a:9 | The Gemara challenges both opinions. <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition against eating <b>creeping animals, as the Merciful One says:</b> “And every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth <b>is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 11:41). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If hunters of undomesticated animals, birds, and fish happen to catch non-kosher species</b> that they did not intend to trap, <b>it is permitted for them to sell</b> them <b>to gentiles.</b> Apparently, one may derive benefit from non-kosher species even though the verse says: “It shall not be eaten.” The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse said: “For you”</b> (Leviticus 11:10), indicating that <b>they will be yours,</b> that one may derive benefit from them. |
| Leviticus 11:41 | five | Pesachim 24a:16 | Similarly, if one ate <b>an ant, he is flogged</b> with <b>five</b> sets of lashes, two sets for the previously mentioned prohibitions of eating a creeping animal, a third based on the verse: “And every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41), and a fourth based on the verse: “All creeping things that swarm upon the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:42). A fifth prohibition is stated in the verse: “You shall not make yourselves impure through every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:44). |
| Leviticus 11:42 | “Even all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, | Beitzah 6b:7 | The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught:</b> The verse that states: <b>“Even all creeping animals that creep upon the earth,</b> you shall not eat them, for they are a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:42) comes <b>to include</b> in the list of prohibited creeping animals even <b>chicks that have not</b> yet <b>opened their eyes. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:42 | “belly [ gaḥon ]” | Kiddushin 30a:11 | <b>Therefore,</b> because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the <b>first</b> Sages <b>were called: Those who count [<i>soferim</i>],</b> because <b>they would count all the letters in the Torah, as they would say</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:42) <b>is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll.</b> The words: <b>“Diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), <b>are the midpoint of the words</b> in a Torah scroll. And the verse that begins with: <b>“Then he shall be shaven”</b> (Leviticus 13:33), is the midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>verses.</b> Similarly, in the expression: <b>“The boar out of the wood [<i>miya’ar</i>] ravages it”</b> (Psalms 80:14), <b>the <i>ayin</i> in</b> the word wood <b>[<i>ya’ar</i>]</b> is the <b>midpoint of Psalms,</b> with regard to its number of letters. The verse: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity”</b> (Psalms 78:38), <b>is the midpoint</b> of <b>verses</b> in the book of Psalms. |
| Leviticus 11:42 | upon the earth” | Nazir 64a:1 | <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i></b> for declaring that in all uncertain cases of floating impurity the person or item remains pure? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says:</b> In the passage dealing with the impurity of creeping animals and the prohibition of eating them <b>it is written: “With any swarming thing that swarms”</b> (Leviticus 11:43), indicating that a carcass of a creeping animal renders items impure in <b>any place where it swarms. And it is written:</b> “All swarming things that swarm <b>upon the earth”</b> (Leviticus 11:42), indicating that it transmits impurity only if it is on the earth. <b>How so?</b> How can one reconcile these two verses? <b>Definite contact</b> with <b>it</b> renders one <b>impure;</b> one who has <b>uncertain contact</b> with <b>it,</b> e.g., the impurity is floating, remains <b>pure.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:42 | “You shall not eat them [ tokhlum ] for they are a detestable thing” | Yevamot 114a:13 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> The verse states, with regard to creeping animals and other non-kosher animals: <b>“You shall not eat them [<i>tokhlum</i>] for they are a detestable thing”</b> (Leviticus 11:42). The Sages interpret this verse as though it said <b><i>ta’akhilum</i>, do not feed them</b> to others. The verse comes <b>to warn adults concerning minors,</b> i.e., not only is it prohibited for adults to eat these items themselves, they may also not feed them to minors. <b>What, is it not</b> the case <b>that</b> this means adults must <b>say to</b> children: <b>Do not eat,</b> and prevent them from transgressing? The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> it means <b>that</b> an adult <b>may not feed</b> the minor non-kosher food directly <b>by</b> direct <b>action,</b> but this does not prove that one must stop a child from eating non-kosher food of his own accord. |
| Leviticus 11:43 | it is written: “With any swarming thing that swarms” | Nazir 64a:1 | <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i></b> for declaring that in all uncertain cases of floating impurity the person or item remains pure? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says:</b> In the passage dealing with the impurity of creeping animals and the prohibition of eating them <b>it is written: “With any swarming thing that swarms”</b> (Leviticus 11:43), indicating that a carcass of a creeping animal renders items impure in <b>any place where it swarms.

| Leviticus 11:43 | four | Pesachim 24a:15 | <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And say</b> that this expression: “It shall not be eaten,” comes to teach not the prohibition against deriving benefit, but rather that one who transgresses this negative mitzva <b>violates two prohibitions.</b> And there is precedent for such an explanation, as <b>didn’t Abaye say</b> with regard to a parallel case: <b>If one ate a small water creature</b> [<b><i>putita</i></b>], <b>he is flogged</b> with <b>four</b> sets of lashes because one violates four prohibitions when eating such a creature? Two of these prohibitions are found in the verse that discusses all types of creeping animals: “You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms, neither shall you make yourselves impure with them, that you should be defiled by them” (Leviticus 11:43). A third prohibition applies to creeping animals that live in the water, as the verses say: “And all that have neither fins nor scales…They shall be a detestable thing unto you; you shall not eat of their flesh” (Leviticus 11:10–11). A fourth prohibition is cited in the verse: “And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:10). |
| Leviticus 11:43 | of “You shall not make yourselves detestable” | Shabbat 90b:5 | We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who carries out</b> a live non-kosher locust is liable for carrying out any amount, because people store locusts for play. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> the <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that people do <b>not</b> give children non-kosher locusts for play. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Due to the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the child <b>will eat it.</b> And the Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> it should <b>also</b> be prohibited to give a child a <b>kosher locust,</b> lest the child will eat it, <b>as</b> the Gemara related <b>that Rav Kahana stood before Rav and passed a</b> live <b>kosher locust near his mouth.</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Put it down,</b> so that <b>people will not</b> mistakenly <b>say: He is eating it and violating</b> the prohibition <b>of “You shall not make yourselves detestable”</b> (Leviticus 11:43). Apparently, eating a kosher locust is prohibited while it is alive. <b>Rather,</b> even according to the unattributed mishna, there is no room for concern that a young child will eat a locust with which he is playing. The reason that the first <i>tanna</i> prohibits giving a non-kosher locust to a child for play is the concern that <b>perhaps it will die and he will eat it. And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who permits giving a non-kosher locust to a child for play, does not share that concern. <b>If</b> the locust <b>dies,</b> the <b>child will eulogize it</b> and mourn its death, and certainly would not eat it. |
| Leviticus 11:43 | as it is stated: “And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified” | Yoma 39a:2 | In <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught: Sin stupefies the heart of a person</b> who commits it, <b>as it is stated: “And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified”</b> (Leviticus 11:43) <b>Do not read</b> that term as: <b>“And be impurified [<i>venitmetem</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>And your</b> hearts will <b>be stupefied</b> [<b><i>venitamtem</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 11:43 | neither shall you make yourselves impure with them, that you should be impure thereby” | Yoma 80b:7 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>But did Rav Pappa</b> actually <b>say that</b> the rendering of ritual impurity of the body through the consumption of impure foods is by rabbinic law? <b>But</b> he appears to say the opposite in another statement: <b>Isn’t it written:</b> “You shall not make yourselves detestable with any creeping thing that creeps, <b>neither shall you make yourselves impure with them, that you should be impure thereby”</b> (Leviticus 11:43). <b>And Rav Pappa said: From here,</b> from the Torah’s usage of the word “impure” with regard to the prohibition of eating, we learn that <b>ritual impurity of the body is by Torah law.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Pappa did not mean that the law is actually Torah law.

| Leviticus 11:44 | while engaging in sexual intercourse will have male children, as it is stated: “You shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy” | Shevuot 18b:11 | <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone who sanctifies himself</b> with modest conduct <b>while engaging in sexual intercourse will have male children, as it is stated: “You shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 11:44), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive</b> and bear a male child” (Leviticus 12:2). |
| Leviticus 11:44 | “Sanctify yourselves, | Yevamot 20b:7 | The Gemara asks: This resolves the issue of priestly prohibitions, but <b>what is there to say</b> about <b>a daughter born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzeret</i>] or a Gibeonite woman,</b> who are prohibited from entering the congregation due to considerations of sanctity? They too may not enter into levirate marriage despite the positive mitzva, which would ordinarily override a prohibition. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> with regard to all of the mitzvot: <b>“Sanctify yourselves,</b> therefore, and be sacred” (Leviticus 11:44). This teaches that in addition to the prohibition, there is the positive mitzva of sanctity. |
| Leviticus 11:44 | a positive mitzva and a prohibition, as it is written: “Sanctify yourselves” | Yevamot 20b:8 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> then every single prohibition in <b>the entire Torah</b> contains both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition, as it is written: “Sanctify yourselves”</b> (Leviticus 11:44). <b>Rather,</b> this reasoning must be rejected, and <b>Rava stated</b> a different reason: While in essence the mitzva of levirate marriage does apply here, nevertheless, <b>a widow from betrothal</b> is prohibited from entering into levirate marriage with the High Priest <b>by</b> rabbinic <b>decree, due to</b> the case of <b>a widow from marriage.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:44 | “Sanctify yourselves and you will be sanctified” | Yoma 39a:4 | Conversely, <b>the Sages taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“Sanctify yourselves and you will be sanctified”</b> (Leviticus 11:44); <b>a person</b> who <b>sanctifies himself a bit, they sanctify him</b> and assist him <b>greatly.</b> If a person sanctifies himself <b>below, they sanctify him above.</b> If a person sanctifies himself <b>in this world, they sanctify him in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:46 | as it is written: “This is the law of the animal, and of the bird” | Chullin 27b:15 | The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>an undomesticated animal,</b> which is mentioned in the same verse, spilling should be sufficient <b>also.</b> The Gemara explains: An undomesticated animal <b>is juxtaposed to disqualified consecrated</b> animals, for which slaughter is required, as explained later in the Gemara (28a). The Gemara asks: <b>Birds too are juxtaposed to animals,</b> and therefore slaughter should be required, <b>as it is written: “This is the law of the animal, and of the bird”</b> (Leviticus 11:46). The Gemara answers: <b>But isn’t it written: “He shall spill its blood,”</b> indicating that slaughter is not required? |
| Leviticus 11:46 | “This is the law of the animal, and of the bird” | Chullin 27b:2 | <b>And this <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof that slaughter is from the neck <b>from here: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Torah writes with regard to the impurity of carcasses: <b>“This is the law of the animal, and of the bird”</b> (Leviticus 11:46), indicating that the two are somehow equated. <b>But with regard to what law is an animal equal to a bird and a bird to an animal?</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity governing animals and birds are not comparable; <b>an animal imparts impurity by contact and by carrying,</b> whereas <b>a bird does not impart impurity by contact or by carrying.</b> Furthermore, <b>a bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat; an animal does not render</b> one’s <b>garments impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:46 | “This is the law of the animal, and of the bird, | Chullin 27b:7 | § The Gemara proceeds to discuss the source for the slaughter of non-sacred birds. <b>Bar Kappara teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“This is the law of the animal, and of the bird,</b> and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that swarms upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:46). <b>The verse situated the bird between</b> the <b>animal and</b> the <b>fish.

How,</b> then, <b>is fitness</b> of a bird for consumption accomplished? It is rendered fit <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>one <i>siman</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:46 | says: It is prohibited for an ignoramus to eat meat, as it is stated: “This is the law [ torah ] of the beast and of the fowl” | Pesachim 49b:3 | The Gemara continues its discussion with regard to an ignoramus. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is prohibited for an ignoramus to eat meat, as it is stated: “This is the law [<i>torah</i>] of the beast and of the fowl”</b> (Leviticus 11:46). He expounds: <b>Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is permitted to eat the meat of animals and fowl, and anyone who does not engage in Torah</b> study <b>is prohibited to eat the meat of animals or fowl.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:46 | “This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl” | Zevachim 69b:8 | The Torah states, with regard to the impurity of unslaughtered animal carcasses: <b>“This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl”</b> (Leviticus 11:46), indicating that the two are somehow equated. <b>But with regard to what law is a beast equal to a fowl and a fowl</b> equal <b>to a beast?</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity governing animals and birds are not comparable; <b>an animal transmits impurity by touching and by carrying,</b> whereas <b>a bird does not transmit impurity by touching or by carrying.</b> Furthermore, <b>a bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat; an animal does not render</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b> |
| Leviticus 11:47 | between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten” | Chullin 42a:10 | The Gemara objects: <b>But the other</b> opinion <b>also requires</b> the word “these” for <b>that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so. Rather, from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive the principle <b>that a <i>tereifa</i> can live?</b> He <b>derives it from the other</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “To make a difference…<b>between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 11:47). <b>These</b> living things that may not be eaten <b>are the eighteen <i>tereifot</i> that were stated to Moses at Sinai</b> and enumerated in the mishna. The verse, then, makes reference to a <i>tereifa</i> as a living thing. |
| Leviticus 11:47 | “To distinguish between the impure and the pure” | Shevuot 18b:10 | The Gemara continues to expound these verses: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> and not over some other beverage, <b>will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the holy and the unholy,</b> and between the impure and the pure” (Leviticus 10:10), <b>and it is written there</b> once again: <b>“To distinguish between the impure and the pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:47), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive</b> and bear a male child” (Leviticus 12:2). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>will have sons who are worthy of teaching</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is written: “To distinguish</b> between the holy and the unholy…<b>and to teach”</b> (Leviticus 10:10–11). |
| Leviticus 11:47 | will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the impure and the pure” | Shevuot 18b:9 | Concerning this matter, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who separates himself from his wife near the expected date of</b> her menstruation <b>will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the impure and the pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:47), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive and bear a male child”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: He will have sons who are worthy of teaching</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is written: “To distinguish…</b>between the impure and the pure, <b>and to teach</b> the children of Israel all the statutes” (Leviticus 10:10–11). |
| Leviticus 12:2 | woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male, as it is stated: “When a woman emitted seed and bore a male” | Berakhot 60a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is prayer effective</b> for that purpose? <b>Didn’t Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Ami, say:</b> The tradition teaches that the gender of the fetus is determined at the moment of conception. If the <b>man emits seed first,</b> his wife <b>gives birth to a female;</b> if the <b>woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male, as it is stated: “When a woman emitted seed and bore a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a case where they both emit seed simultaneously.</b> In that case, the gender is undetermined and prayer may be effectual. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | the children of Israel, | Keritot 7b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that in the case of a Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> owned by a Jew, who miscarried, she brings a sin offering and it is eaten? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The passage discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of a woman following childbirth begins with the verse: “Speak to <b>the children of Israel,</b> saying: If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male” (Leviticus 12:2). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the full-fledged <b>children of Israel</b> are included in these <i>halakhot</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a convert and</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant</b> are also included in these <i>halakhot</i>? <b>The verse states “a woman,”</b> which includes other women. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | “If a woman conceives [ tazria ] and gives birth to a male” | Keritot 7b:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> their <b>reasoning? Rabbi Mani bar Pattish said</b> that their ruling is derived from the verse: <b>“If a woman conceives [<i>tazria</i>] and gives birth to a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). The word <i>tazria</i> literally means to receive seed, indicating that all the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in that passage do not apply <b>unless she gives birth through the place where she receives seed,</b> not through any other place, such as in the case of a caesarean section. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | of Rabbi Yoḥanan. As the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male, | Niddah 27b:14 | <b>A certain elder said to Rabbi Ami: I will explain to you the reason</b> for the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan. As the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male,</b> she shall be impure seven days, as in the days of the menstruation of her sickness she shall be impure” (Leviticus 12:2). This indicates that <b>even</b> if a woman <b>gives birth to</b> an offspring that is <b>similar only to the seed that she bore,</b> i.e., if the offspring liquefied and became similar to semen, the woman is <b>impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:2 | man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female, as it is stated: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male” | Niddah 31a:23 | § <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> The sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception. If the <b>woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female, as it is stated: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). |
| Leviticus 12:2 | hear | Niddah 35b:27 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>, which addresses the verse: “If a woman be delivered, and bear a male, then she shall be impure seven days; as in the days of her menstrual sickness she shall be impure” (Leviticus 12:2). The superfluous phrase <b>“her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her,</b> teaching that he is rendered impure like a menstruating woman and imparts impurity like her. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | As it is taught | Niddah 37b:3 | <b>Abaye says: From where do I say</b> that although the birth does not negate the count of a <i>zava</i>, it does not count toward the seven clean days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> which addresses the verse: “If a woman be delivered, and bear a male, then she shall be impure seven days; as in the days of her menstrual sickness she shall be impure” (Leviticus 12:2). The superfluous phrase: <b>“Her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her,</b> teaching that he is rendered impure as a menstruating woman and imparts impurity like her. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | “male” | Niddah 40a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this superfluous expression? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary to include</b> the birth of a child <b>whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>] or a hermaphrodite. As</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the words <b>“male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2) <b>and “female”</b> (Leviticus 12:5) are <b>written</b> in the passage, these <i>halakhot</i> apply only to <b>a definite male</b> and <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> Therefore, the term “she gives birth” <b>teaches us</b> that it is the birth itself, not the sex of the offspring, that matters. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | to a menstruating woman | Pesachim 90b:26 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>I might</b> have thought that a menstruating woman or a woman after childbirth <b>should immerse while still day,</b> like others who are obligated to immerse. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a woman should have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, <b>she shall be in her impurity seven days”</b> (Leviticus 15:19), which indicates that <b>she shall be in her</b> state of <b>impurity</b> for a <b>full seven</b> days and doesn’t immerse until the night following the seventh day. <b>And</b> this is also true of <b>a woman after childbirth,</b> who <b>is compared</b> in the Torah <b>to a menstruating woman</b> in the verse “If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male, then she shall be unclean seven days, as in the days of her menstrual flow shall she be unclean” (Leviticus 12:2). |
| Leviticus 12:2 | near it: “If a woman conceive | Shevuot 18b:10 | The Gemara continues to expound these verses: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> and not over some other beverage, <b>will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the holy and the unholy,</b> and between the impure and the pure” (Leviticus 10:10), <b>and it is written there</b> once again: <b>“To distinguish between the impure and the pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:47), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive</b> and bear a male child” (Leviticus 12:2). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>will have sons who are worthy of teaching</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is written: “To distinguish</b> between the holy and the unholy…<b>and to teach”</b> (Leviticus 10:10–11). |

| Leviticus 12:2 | “Speak to the children of Israel, | Yevamot 74b:17 | <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, strongly objects to this</b> argument: <b>And how can you say</b> that a <i>halakha</i> governing <b><i>teruma</i> is written here,</b> in the verse: “Until the days of her purification are completed” (Leviticus 12:4)? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The section dealing with a woman following childbirth opens with the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel,</b> saying: If a woman delivers and bears a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her menstrual affliction shall she be unclean” (Leviticus 12:2). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the children of Israel</b> are included in this <i>halakha</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a convert and an emancipated maidservant</b> are also included? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A woman,”</b> which includes other women. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the verse is speaking <b>of <i>teruma</i>, are a convert and a maidservant eligible to eat <i>teruma</i>?</b> It is prohibited for them to marry priests, so there can be no possibility of their eating <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 12:3 | as it is written: “And on the eighth day he shall be circumcised” | Megillah 20a:9 | § The mishna continues: <b>And one may not perform a circumcision</b> until after sunrise, <b>as it is written: “And on the eighth day he shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3). This indicates that the circumcision must be during the day, not at night. |
| Leviticus 12:3 | as it is written: “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” | Pesachim 4a:6 | <b>And lest you say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>the vigilant are early</b> in the performance <b>of mitzvot, let us search in the morning.</b> The principle: The vigilant are early in the performance of mitzvot, is derived, <b>as it is written: “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire day is suitable for</b> performance of the mitzva of <b>circumcision; however, the vigilant are early</b> in the performance <b>of mitzvot,</b> and circumcise in the morning. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the binding of Isaac: <b>“And Abraham arose early in the morning”</b> (Genesis 22:3) after hearing God’s command. This indicates that Abraham arose early in his eagerness to perform God’s commandment. |
| Leviticus 12:3 | shall be circumcised” | Sanhedrin 59b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, which was stated with regard to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., Abraham and his descendants, who had the status of descendants of Noah at that time? <b>As it is written</b> that God said to Abraham with regard to the mitzva of circumcision: <b>“And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). <b>And it was repeated at Sinai</b> for the Jewish people: <b>“And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), and nevertheless <b>it was stated for the Jewish people</b> alone <b>and not for the descendants of Noah.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | his foreskin [ orlato ] | Shabbat 108a:7 | Karna also asked: <b>From where</b> is derived <b>that circumcision is</b> performed <b>in that place?</b> Rav answered him: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to circumcision: “And on the eighth day he shall circumcise the flesh of <b>his foreskin [<i>orlato</i>]</b>” (Leviticus 12:3), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to recently planted trees: “And when you come to the land and plant all types of fruit trees, and you shall count the fruit <b>thereof as forbidden [<i>orlato</i>];</b> three years shall it be as forbidden unto you, it shall not be eaten.” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>Just as there</b> the Torah is referring to a tree, which <b>is an item that bears fruit, here, too,</b> in the case of circumcision, <i>orla</i> is referring to <b>an item that bears fruit.</b> He asked him: <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s heart, as it is written: “And you shall circumcise the foreskin of [<i>orlat</i>] your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16)? <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s ear, as it is written: “Behold, their ear is dull [<i>areila</i>]</b> and they cannot listen” (Jeremiah 6:10)? Rav said to him: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> another instance of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i>; and one does not derive</b> the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> the <b>incomplete</b> form <b><i>orlat,</i></b> which modifies another word, as is also the case with the word <i>areila</i>. |
| Leviticus 12:3 | of Rabbi Eliezer, as the verse says: “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” | Shabbat 132a:1 | in each, <b>as if its time passed, it is void,</b> unlike the mitzva of circumcision, which can be fulfilled at a later date if the child is not circumcised on the eighth day. <b>Rather, this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, as the verse says: “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), indicating that he is circumcised on the eighth day <b>even</b> if it falls <b>on Shabbat.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | on the | Shabbat 132a:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse says:</b> “And <b>on the</b> eighth day…shall be circumcised” (Leviticus 12:3), which means that the child is circumcised <b>on the</b> eighth <b>day</b> whenever it occurs, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | shall be circumcised” | Shabbat 132b:2 | <b>And what</b> was the reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>said: Or perhaps,</b> and questioned his previous statement? <b>He reconsidered</b> and <b>said: And from where</b> do we know <b>that leprosy is</b> more <b>stringent</b> than Shabbat? <b>Perhaps Shabbat is</b> more <b>stringent, as it includes</b> the severe <b>punishments</b> of <i>karet</i> and execution by stoning, <b>and numerous warnings</b> pertaining to it throughout the Torah. <b>Alternatively, and from where</b> do we know that the reason the Temple service does not override the prohibition of leprosy is specifically <b>because leprosy is</b> more <b>stringent</b> than the Temple service? <b>Perhaps</b> the Temple service does not override the prohibition of leprosy <b>because a man</b> afflicted with leprosy <b>is unfit</b> to perform the Temple service and not due to the stringency of the prohibition to remove symptoms of leprosy from one’s body. <b>And</b> if so, <b>how do I establish</b> the verse: “And on the <b>eighth</b> day the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3)? That it applies to days <b>other than Shabbat.</b> Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> cited additional proof from that which <b>the Torah states: “On the day,”</b> indicating that circumcision is performed <b>even on Shabbat.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” | Shabbat 132b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And on the eighth day <b>the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), since this verse is stated in general terms, it teaches that <b>even though there is a bright white</b> leprous <b>spot there, he should cut it. And how do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“Take care with regard to the plague of leprosy</b> to take great care and to perform in accordance with all that the priests, the Levites, instruct you; as I commanded them you shall take care to perform” (Deuteronomy 24:8)? Does usage of the term “take care” indicate that there is a negative mitzva that prohibits cutting off symptoms of leprosy? We establish this prohibition as applying <b>in other places, other than</b> the place of a <b>circumcision.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | The Sages taught | Shabbat 134b:23 | We learned in the mishna: If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether or not to circumcise a baby, <b>and</b> likewise in the case of <b>a hermaphrodite</b> baby, one does not desecrate Shabbat to perform the circumcision of <b>a hermaphrodite,</b> even on the eighth day following the birth. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” (Leviticus 12:3), and they interpreted the verse: <b>“His foreskin”</b> indicates that only the circumcision of <b>his</b> halakhically <b>certain foreskin overrides Shabbat,</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | circumcised at eight | Shabbat 137a:20 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although <b>a child is</b> generally <b>circumcised at eight</b> days, as the verse states: “And on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” (Leviticus 12:3), nevertheless, at times he is circumcised <b>at nine</b> days, at times <b>at ten</b> days, <b>at eleven</b> days, <b>and at twelve</b> days, <b>no earlier and no later.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:3 | “and on the day” | Yevamot 72b:3 | <b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees that the obligation to circumcise one whose foreskin was <b>drawn forward</b> is <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> that the obligation to circumcise <b>a child whose</b> appropriate <b>time</b> for circumcision <b>has</b> already <b>passed</b> is <b>by Torah law. And here they disagree with regard to the following: One Sage holds</b> that <b>we expound</b> the phrase <b>“and on the day”</b> in the verse “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” (Leviticus 12:3). The superfluous word “and” indicates that even if the child was not circumcised on the eighth day, the procedure must still be performed during the day. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not expound</b> the phrase <b>“and on the day,”</b> and therefore a circumcision must be performed during the day only when it takes place on the eighth day, but afterward it may be performed even at night. |
| Leviticus 12:3 | “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” | Yoma 28b:4 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> And will <b>we arise and derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from Abraham?</b> Didn’t Abraham live before the Torah was given to the Jewish people, and therefore <i>halakhot</i> cannot be derived from his conduct? <b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i> derived</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from Abraham’s</b> conduct, <b>and we do not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from his</b> conduct? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), this verse <b>teaches that the entire day is suitable for</b> performance of the mitzva of <b>circumcision. However, the vigilant are early</b> in their performance of <b>mitzvot</b> and circumcise in the morning, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the binding of Isaac: <b>“And Abraham arose early in the morning and saddled</b> his donkey” (Genesis 22:3). He awakened early to fulfill the mitzva without delay. Apparently, <i>halakha</i> is derived from the conduct of Abraham. |
| Leviticus 12:3 | ” | Yoma 34b:5 | <b>And did Abaye</b> actually <b>say that</b> an unintentional act is permitted? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “And on the eighth day the <b>flesh of his foreskin</b> shall be circumcised<b>”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), from which it is derived that <b>one</b> may <b>cut</b> the foreskin and circumcise the baby <b>even if there is a white spot</b> of leprosy <b>there?</b> He may do so even though the Torah prohibits excising a white spot of leprosy. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. And we discussed</b> this matter: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to permit it? His intention is not to excise the leprosy but to fulfill the mitzva of circumcision. <b>And Abaye said:</b> The statement of Rabbi Yoshiya is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> that performing <b>an unintentional act is prohibited.</b> Therefore, a special verse is necessary to permit circumcision in that case. Apparently, Abaye holds that Rabbi Yehuda prohibits even unintentional acts. Why, then, does he explain that Rabbi Yehuda permits placing blocks of iron into the water if his intention is not to harden the iron? |
| Leviticus 12:4 | thirty | Keritot 10a:18 | <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> which discusses a woman who gave birth to a male. The verse states: “And she shall continue in the blood of purification three days and <b>thirty</b> days” (Leviticus 12:4). One <b>might</b> have thought that she counts the days <b>whether they are continuous or dispersed.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Three <b>days</b> and thirty days,” to teach that <b>just as a day is an entirely continuous</b> time period, <b>so too</b> all <b>thirty</b> days <b>are</b> to be <b>continuous.</b> And <b>whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>the Rabbis,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>are the Rabbis of</b> the opinion that |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “No consecrated item shall she touch” | Makkot 14b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Reish Lakish,</b> does <b>this</b> verse: <b>“No consecrated item shall she touch”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> prohibition concerning partaking of sacrificial food? <b>He requires that</b> verse in order <b>to</b> derive the prohibition of <b>a ritually impure person who touched sacrificial</b> food. <b>As it was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to <b>a ritually impure person who touched sacrificial</b> food. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>flogged. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>flogged,</b> as it is written: <b>“No consecrated item shall she touch.” Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged,</b> because it <b>is</b> to teach <b>a prohibition for</b> touching <b><i>teruma</i> that this</b> verse <b>comes.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:4 | The verse states: “No consecrated item shall she touch, and to the Temple | Makkot 14b:15 | The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish.</b> It is written: <b>“No consecrated item shall she touch”;</b> this is <b>a prohibition for</b> a ritually impure person who <b>eats</b> sacrificial food. <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>a prohibition for</b> a ritually impure person who <b>eats</b> sacrificial food, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>it is only a prohibition for</b> a ritually impure person who <b>touches</b> sacrificial food? <b>The verse states: “No consecrated item shall she touch, and to the Temple</b> she may not come” (Leviticus 12:4). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the matter of a ritually impure person eating <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>to</b> the matter of entering <b>the Temple</b> while ritually impure. <b>Just as</b> entering <b>the Temple</b> is <b>a matter</b> that entails a punishment <b>that involves the taking of a life,</b> i.e., <i>karet</i>, <b>so too, every matter</b> in that verse entails a punishment <b>that involves the taking of a life.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And if</b> the prohibition is <b>with regard to touching</b> sacrificial food, <b>is there</b> a punishment that entails <b>the taking of a life? Rather,</b> the prohibition is <b>with regard to eating.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “No consecrated item shall she touch” | Makkot 14b:7 | <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The prohibition is derived from that which is written with regard to a woman after childbirth who has not yet completed the purification process: <b>“No consecrated item shall she touch”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), and the reference is not merely to touching, but to eating. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “And she shall not enter into the Sanctuary” | Shevuot 17b:7 | The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Oshaya, that wherever entering is mentioned in the Torah, the reference is to the normal manner of entering: With regard to <b>those roofs</b> that covered the various chambers found in the Temple courtyard, <b>offerings of the most sacred order may not be eaten there,</b> on them, <b>and offerings of lesser sanctity may not be slaughtered there,</b> because those roofs do not have the sanctity of the Temple courtyard. <b>And a ritually impure person who enters the Sanctuary via</b> those <b>roofs is exempt, as it is stated</b> with regard to a woman who became ritually impure: <b>“And she shall not enter into the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), teaching that <b>the Torah prohibited</b> only <b>the normal manner of entering</b> the Temple. So too, in the case of a house afflicted with leprosy, where mention is made of entering, only one who enters into the house in the normal manner becomes impure, as stated by Rabbi Oshaya. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “She may not touch any sacred item and she may not enter the Temple” | Shevuot 7a:6 | The Gemara continues: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the sliding-scale offering atones for the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods; <b>from where do we</b> derive that it also atones for the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple</b> by entering it while ritually impure? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a woman after childbirth, who is impure due to having given birth: <b>“She may not touch any sacred item and she may not enter the Temple”</b> (Leviticus 12:4). The verse <b>juxtaposes the Temple to sacred</b> items to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> that apply to one apply to the other. Accordingly, the sliding-scale offering atones for both. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | until the days of her purification are completed” | Yevamot 74b:13 | <b>Abaye said: Two verses are written with regard to a woman after childbirth: It is written:</b> “She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, <b>until the days of her purification are completed”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), which suggests that <b>once her days are completed</b> and the sun has set on the last day, <b>she is</b> completely <b>pure</b> and requires nothing more. <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 12:8), which indicates that following childbirth a woman is not completely pure until she has brought her offerings. <b>How so? Here,</b> in the first verse, it is referring <b>to <i>teruma</i>; there,</b> in the second verse, it is referring <b>to sacrificial food.</b> A woman following childbirth falls into the category of one who lacks atonement, but nevertheless the verse teaches that if she has immersed, she may eat <i>teruma</i> after sunset. The same is true of a confirmed leper and all others who lack atonement. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | teruma is written here, | Yevamot 74b:17 | <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, strongly objects to this</b> argument: <b>And how can you say</b> that a <i>halakha</i> governing <b><i>teruma</i> is written here,</b> in the verse: “Until the days of her purification are completed” (Leviticus 12:4)? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The section dealing with a woman following childbirth opens with the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel,</b> saying: If a woman delivers and bears a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her menstrual affliction shall she be unclean” (Leviticus 12:2). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the children of Israel</b> are included in this <i>halakha</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a convert and an emancipated maidservant</b> are also included? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A woman,”</b> which includes other women. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the verse is speaking <b>of <i>teruma</i>, are a convert and a maidservant eligible to eat <i>teruma</i>?</b> It is prohibited for them to marry priests, so there can be no possibility of their eating <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “She shall touch no hallowed thing, | Yevamot 75a:1 | <b>But isn’t it written</b> in that same section dealing with a woman after childbirth: <b>“She shall touch no hallowed thing,</b> nor come into the Sanctuary, until the days of her purification are completed” (Leviticus 12:4), which comes <b>to include <i>teruma</i>? Rather, the Torah considers several</b> distinct <b>matters</b> separately, and not all the verses refer to <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | touching of teruma is derived from here: “She shall touch no hallowed thing, | Yevamot 75a:10 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the prohibition with regard to the <b>touching of <i>teruma</i> is derived from here: “She shall touch no hallowed thing,</b> nor come into the Sanctuary, until the days of her purification are completed” (Leviticus 12:4); this is <b>a warning with respect to one who eats</b> <i>teruma</i> after having immersed but before sunset. <b>Or,</b> perhaps, <b>it is nothing other than</b> a warning <b>with respect to one who touches</b> <i>teruma</i> before sunset, as is implied by the plain reading of the verse? |
| Leviticus 12:4 | the verse states: “She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, | Yevamot 75a:11 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary,</b> until the days of her purification are completed” (Leviticus 12:4), thereby <b>juxtaposing consecrated</b> food <b>to the Sanctuary. Just as</b> the prohibition against entering <b>the Sanctuary is a matter that involves the taking of life,</b> as one who enters the Sanctuary while impure is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against touching <b>consecrated</b> food must be <b>a matter that involves the taking of life,</b> e.g., eating <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual impurity; <b>but</b> the prohibition against <b>touching</b> <i>teruma</i> in a state of impurity <b>does not involve the taking of life,</b> as there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> for mere touching. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | until the days of her purification are completed” | Yevamot 75a:3 | <b>And had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“And when the sun has set,”</b> I might have said that <b>this applies</b> only <b>to</b> one <b>who does not require</b> an <b>atonement</b> offering, <b>but</b> as for one <b>who requires</b> an <b>atonement</b> offering, one might <b>say</b> that he may not eat <i>teruma</i> <b>until he brings</b> his <b>atonement</b> offering. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, <b>until the days of her purification are completed”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), which indicates that she may eat <i>teruma</i> as soon as her days of purification are completed, and she need not wait until after she has brought her atonement offering. |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “Every consecrated item she shall not touch, | Zevachim 32b:3 | § Apropos the question of whether partial entry into the Temple courtyard is considered entry, <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says: A ritually impure</b> individual <b>who inserted his hand inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition of entering the Temple while impure, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the impurity of a woman who gave birth: <b>“Every consecrated item she shall not touch,</b> and to the Temple she shall not come, until the days of her purification are complete” (Leviticus 12:4). The verse <b>juxtaposes entry</b> into the courtyard <b>to touching</b> a sacred item. <b>Just as touching with</b> even <b>a part</b> of the body <b>is considered touching, so too, entry with part</b> of the body <b>is considered entry.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:4 | “Every consecrated item she shall not touch” | Zevachim 33b:3 | This is <b>as it was stated:</b> There is an amoraic dispute with regard to <b>an impure person who touched sacrificial</b> food. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>flogged. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged.</b> The Gemara elaborates. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>flogged,</b> as it is written: <b>“Every consecrated item she shall not touch”</b> (Leviticus 12:4). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged,</b> as <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to</b> touching <b>the portion of the produce designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 12:4 | Temple | Zevachim 33b:6 | The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish holds that both can be derived from Leviticus 12:4. The prohibition with regard to <b>a ritually impure</b> individual <b>who touched sacrificial</b> food is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expressed</b> this prohibition <b>with a term of touching,</b> while <b>the prohibition with regard to one who eats</b> sacrificial food while impure is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed</b> the prohibition of eating <b>sacrificial</b> food while impure <b>to</b> the prohibition of entering the <b>Temple</b> while impure in the verse: “Every consecrated item she shall not touch, and to the Temple she shall not come” (Leviticus 12:4). |
| Leviticus 12:4 | The verse states: “Every consecrated item she shall not touch, and to the Temple she shall not come” | Zevachim 33b:8 | <b>The verse states: “Every consecrated item she shall not touch, and to the Temple she shall not come”</b> (Leviticus 12:4). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the matter pertaining to <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>to</b> the matter of entering the <b>Temple</b> while ritually impure. <b>Just as</b> entering the <b>Temple</b> is <b>a matter</b> that entails a punishment <b>that involves</b> |
| Leviticus 12:5 | she bears | Bekhorot 47b:15 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: The first</b> son is a firstborn <b>with regard to inheritance</b> if he is his father’s first son, <b>and the second</b> son is a firstborn with regard to redemption from a priest <b>for five <i>sela</i></b> coins. The Gemara explains: The verse states: “And they have borne him children,” and a caesarean section is not called a birth. <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> with regard to a verse that deals with the ritual impurity of a woman after childbirth: “But if <b>she bears</b> a girl” (Leviticus 12:5), that the apparently superfluous term “she bears” serves <b>to include</b> a child <b>born by caesarean section,</b> and the same applies with regard to a firstborn for inheritance. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | sixty | Keritot 10a:13 | <b>Rabbi Shemaya said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a woman who gave birth to a female: “And she shall continue in the blood of purification <b>sixty</b> days and six days” (Leviticus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that she counts the days <b>whether they are continuous or dispersed.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Sixty <b>days</b> and six days,” to teach that <b>just as a day is a continuous</b> time period, <b>so too all sixty</b> days <b>are continuous.</b> And <b>whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>are the Rabbis of</b> the opinion that it is possible for a woman who gave birth to count <b>dispersed</b> days? This is not the case, as the Rabbis count the days of purification from the second birth. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | and six days” | Keritot 10b:2 | <b>And further, Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>, which discusses the verse: “Sixty days <b>and six days”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that she counts these six days <b>whether they are continuous or dispersed,</b> so that if, for example, she miscarried on the sixty-third day, she would complete the remaining three days of purity for the first fetus after completing the period of purification for the second. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Sixty”</b> to teach that <b>just as the sixty days are all continuous, so too, the six days are all continuous. Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>are the Rabbis</b> of the opinion that it is possible for a woman who gave birth to count <b>dispersed</b> days? <b>Didn’t the Rabbis say</b> that <b>she counts for</b> the <b>second offspring?</b> |
| Leviticus 12:5 | the verse states: “But if she bears a girl” | Keritot 7b:19 | § The mishna teaches: And <b>these</b> women <b>do not bring</b> a sin offering, and among them are a woman who gives birth by caesarean section. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> a woman <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>in</b> a case where she gives birth by <b>caesarean section.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse states: “But if she bears a girl”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). The term “she bears” is superfluous in the context of the passage, and it serves <b>to include another</b> type of <b>birth,</b> and <b>what</b> is <b>it?</b> This is a birth by <b>caesarean section.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:5 | “She shall observe | Niddah 36b:19 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the days of purity after childbirth: <b>“She shall observe</b> the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5). This indicates that <b>you have another</b> instance of an <b>observance that is like this one,</b> i.e., where the woman is not rendered impure by an emission of blood. <b>And which</b> is <b>this</b> other case? <b>This</b> is the case of blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains during</b> the eleven <b>days of <i>ziva</i>.</b> An emission during the days of menstruation, by contrast, renders the woman a menstruating woman. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> other case is where a woman has an emission of blood due to labor <b>pains during the days of menstruation,</b> not where she experiences an emission during the days of <i>ziva</i>. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | verse states: “And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation” | Niddah 36b:20 | <b>Rather, Shmuel’s father said</b> the <b>verse states: “And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 12:5), <b>and not: As in her <i>ziva</i>. By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> there is an instance in which an emission of blood that occurs during <b>her</b> days of <b><i>ziva</i></b> is <b>pure. And which</b> case is <b>this? This</b> is the case of blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains during</b> the eleven <b>days of <i>ziva</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:5 | the Sages taught | Niddah 38b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis concerning a woman who emits blood due to labor pains during her days of purity, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that addresses a verse discussing a woman who gives birth to a female: “And sixty-six days she shall observe the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5). The term <b>“She shall observe”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains within eighty</b> days <b>of</b> giving birth to <b>a female,</b> teaching <b>that all blood that she sees is ritually pure.</b> And this remains the case <b>until the child emerges</b> from the womb. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer deems ritually impure</b> the blood that occurs due to these labor pains. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | the verse states: “She shall observe | Niddah 38b:18 | This Gemara raises a difficulty against the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer: If so, one can <b>say</b> that if she emits blood due to labor pains <b>during the days of menstruation</b> she is <b>a menstruating woman,</b> but if she emits blood <b>in the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> i.e., after the days of menstruation, she is <b>pure.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “She shall observe</b> the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5), which indicates that there is <b>one observance for all</b> the days of her purity, i.e., all the blood she emits due to labor pains during her days of purity is either pure or impure. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | “And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation” | Niddah 38b:4 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> Labor <b>pains</b> do <b>not</b> occur <b>more than two weeks</b> before birth. <b>Shmuel said: What is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to a woman who gives birth to a female: <b>“And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). The verse indicates that she is impure <b>as in her menstruation but not as in her <i>ziva</i>. By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that her <i>ziva</i> is pure,</b> i.e., if she emits blood accompanied by labor pains she is not rendered a <i>zava</i>. <b>And</b> for <b>how</b> long is this the case? For <b>two weeks.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:5 | she gives birth | Niddah 40a:6 | The Gemara further asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon, what is</b> the <b>reason</b> for <b>his</b> opinion that the <i>halakhot</i> of childbirth apply in the case of a caesarean section? <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that it is because the <b>verse states:</b> “But if <b>she gives birth</b> to a female” (Leviticus 12:5). The term “she gives birth” is superfluous in the context of the passage, as it was mentioned previously, and it therefore serves <b>to include</b> the birth of an offspring by <b>caesarean section.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:5 | and “female” | Niddah 40a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this superfluous expression? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary to include</b> the birth of a child <b>whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>] or a hermaphrodite. As</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the words <b>“male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2) <b>and “female”</b> (Leviticus 12:5) are <b>written</b> in the passage, these <i>halakhot</i> apply only to <b>a definite male</b> and <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> Therefore, the term “she gives birth” <b>teaches us</b> that it is the birth itself, not the sex of the offspring, that matters. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | students asked Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz: | Sanhedrin 4a:4 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: His <b>students asked Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz:</b> The verse states: “But if she gives birth to a female, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstrual impurity; and she shall then continue in the blood of purification for sixty-six days” (Leviticus 12:5). Based on the written consonantal text, <b>I can read</b> the amount of time she is impure as: <b>“Seventy [<i>shivim</i>]</b> days,” and not as: “Two weeks [<i>shevuayim</i>].” One <b>might</b> have thought, therefore, that a woman who <b>gives birth to a female should be impure</b> for <b>seventy</b> days. |
| Leviticus 12:5 | then she shall be impure two weeks [ shevu’ayim ], | Zevachim 38a:2 | The Gemara raises yet another objection: <b>If that is so,</b> that both the vocalized and the consonantal texts are taken into account, consider the case of a woman who gives birth to a female child. Concerning this woman the verse states: “But if she bear a female child, <b>then she shall be impure two weeks [<i>shevu’ayim</i>],</b> as in her menstruation” (Leviticus 12:5). The way that the word is written allows it to be read as <b><i>shivim</i>,</b> seventy. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text</b> of the Torah <b>is effective,</b> teaching us that the woman is ritually impure for fourteen days, <b>and the consonantal text is</b> also <b>effective,</b> teaching us that she is impure for seventy days, and, therefore, <b>she</b> should be <b>required to sit</b> in a state of ritual impurity for <b>forty-two</b> days, which is the halfway point between fourteen and seventy days? |
| Leviticus 12:6 | the verse states: “A sheep in its first year” | Arakhin 18b:8 | The Gemara asks: With regard to the one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it is calculated by whole years rather than calendar years? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> that <b>the verse states: “A sheep in its first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse does not state: A sheep in the first year, it means <b>a year</b> based on the calculation of <b>its</b> own life, <b>and not</b> a year based <b>on the counting of the world,</b> i.e., the calendar year. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | before | Arakhin 21a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason for the ruling that a woman after childbirth is required to bring her burnt offering before she can sacrifice her sin offering? Is it <b>that the verse</b> mentions her burnt offering <b>before</b> it mentions her sin offering, as it is written: “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled…she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:6)? <b>But doesn’t Rava say: The verse</b> mentions her burnt offering <b>before</b> her sin offering only with regard <b>to</b> the <b>reading</b> of the verse, but not with regard to the order of the offerings? If so, there should be a concern that she might first sacrifice her sin offering and delay bringing her burnt offering. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | a lamb in its first year | Bekhorot 27b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does <b>the school of Rav</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn must be eaten within its own year and that its year is not calculated according to the calendar year? <b>They derive it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of other <b>sacrificial</b> animals, whose age is counted from their birth rather than by the calendar year. <b>And</b> with regard to the other <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>themselves, from where do we</b> derive that their age is counted from their birth? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring <b>a lamb in its first year</b> for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest” (Leviticus 12:6). This description of the lamb is referring to <b>its</b> own <b>year, and not a year of the counting of the world.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:6 | as it is written: “A lamb of the first year” | Keritot 10b:10 | <b>From where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> derived? It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the <b>ram</b> brought in its second year as <b>a guilt offering</b> must be “according to your valuation in <b>silver</b> by <b>shekels”</b> (Leviticus 5:15), i.e., it must be worth two <i>sela</i>. It may therefore be understood <b>by inference that a lamb,</b> i.e., a young ram, <b>in its</b> first <b>year is</b> worth <b>one <i>sela</i>.</b> And it is known that a lamb is brought when it is within its first year, <b>as it is written: “A lamb of the first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (8a): The price of <b>nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds brought by an impoverished person instead of a lamb, <b>stood that day at one-quarter</b> of a silver dinar. A quarter-dinar is one-sixteenth of a <i>sela</i>, the price of a lamb. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | the verse states: “And a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering” | Keritot 28a:28 | Similarly, <b>doves precede pigeons</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “And he shall bring his guilt offering…two doves, or two pigeons” (Leviticus 5:7). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> doves <b>are more select than</b> pigeons. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 12:6), with the usual order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:6 | for a daughter” | Keritot 8a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> In continuation of the discussion of the mishna, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai:</b> The verse <b>states:</b> “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or <b>for a daughter”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). The entire clause: “For a son or for a daughter,” is superfluous and serves <b>to include the night</b> preceding the <b>eighty-first</b> day, i.e., if she has a miscarriage at that point she is obligated to bring another offering. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | for a daughter” | Keritot 8a:4 | <b>Bar Kappara said to</b> Rabbi Hoshaya: <b>What does</b> the <b>Babylonian,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ḥiyya, who came from Babylonia, <b>say about this matter? Rabbi Hoshaya was silent and did not say anything. Bar Kappara said to him:</b> Do <b>we require the statement of Iyya,</b> i.e., Ḥiyya? <b>Let us review the earlier</b> ruling, as the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the verse that <b>states:</b> “For a son or <b>for a daughter”</b> (Leviticus 12:6), serves <b>to include the night of</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day. This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in the case of a woman after childbirth. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | pigeon or dove as a sin offering | Keritot 9a:7 | The Gemara challenges this assertion as well: <b>But isn’t there</b> the offering of <b>a woman after childbirth, who brings</b> a single <b>pigeon or dove as a sin offering</b> (Leviticus 12:6)? The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, <b>because</b> in that case <b>there is a lamb with it</b> as part of her offerings; the bird is not brought as a complete offering by itself. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | the verse states: “And when the days of her purity are fulfilled… | Nazir 64b:8 | Therefore, to counteract this possibility, <b>the verse states: “And when the days of her purity are fulfilled…</b>she shall bring” (Leviticus 12:6). This teaches that it is only if she miscarried <b>on the day of the fulfillment</b> itself that <b>she must bring</b> an offering for a miscarriage, but if she miscarried <b>before the fulfillment</b> of the days of her purity of the earlier miscarriage, even if this occurred more than eighty days after the first birth, <b>she does not bring</b> another offering. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | which bar Livai teaches, as bar Livai teaches | Niddah 40a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive that these <i>halakhot</i> apply to a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that <b>which bar Livai teaches, as bar Livai teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the verse: “And when the days of her purity are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter” (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse uses the terms “son” and “daughter,” rather than male and female, it is derived from the term <b>“for a son”</b> that these <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a son in any case,</b> even if his masculinity is not definite. Similarly, the term <b>“for a daughter”</b> teaches that these <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a daughter in any case,</b> even if her femininity is not definite. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | year stated with regard to sacrificial | Niddah 47b:20 | The Gemara answers that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and Rav maintains in accordance with the opinion that full years are required. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Full years are required with regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “a lamb in its first year” (Leviticus 12:6); the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which one can redeem a house he has sold in a walled city (see Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one cannot yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (see Leviticus 25:15). |
| Leviticus 12:6 | the verse states: “A lamb in its first year” | Niddah 47b:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals is calculated by whole years and not by calendar years? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that <b>the verse states: “A lamb in its first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse does not state: A one-year-old lamb, it means <b>a year</b> based on calculation of <b>its</b> life, <b>and not a year of the universal count,</b> i.e., the calendar year. |
| Leviticus 12:6 | burnt offering takes precedence, | Zevachim 90a:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a further proof from a <i>baraita</i>. The Torah states that a woman who has given birth must bring a sheep as a burnt offering and a bird as a sin offering. If she is poor she may bring two birds: “One for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In <b>every</b> other <b>instance where</b> a bird offering <b>is exchanged</b> for an animal <b>sin offering,</b> the <b>sin offering precedes</b> the burnt offering. For example, in the case of the sliding scale sin offering brought for entering the Temple while ritually impure, where a poor person brings two birds, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, the sin offering comes first. <b>But here, in</b> the case of <b>a woman who gave birth,</b> the <b>burnt offering takes precedence,</b> as it takes the place of an animal burnt offering, mentioned first in the verse: “She shall bring a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering (Leviticus 12:6). |
| Leviticus 12:7 | “This is the law for the woman who bears a child, whether a male or a female” | Keritot 9b:19 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a woman who gave birth to several offspring brings a single offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>As the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“This is the law for the woman who bears a child, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 12:7). <b>This teaches that she brings one offering for several offspring.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that she brings one single offering <b>even</b> in a case where she becomes purified simultaneously both <b>for a birth and for</b> an irregular <b>discharge</b> of blood from the uterus <b>[<i>ziva</i>].</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> to exclude such a case. |
| Leviticus 12:7 | “This is the law of a woman after childbirth” | Nedarim 35b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> with regard to that which is written: <b>“This is the law of a woman after childbirth”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), would he interpret that the <i>halakhot</i> of a woman after childbirth apply to <b>both an adult and a minor? Is a minor capable of</b> giving <b>birth? But didn’t Rav Beivai teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> It is permitted for <b>three women</b> to <b>engage in intercourse with</b> a contraceptive <b>resorbent: A minor, and a pregnant</b> woman, <b>and a nursing</b> woman; <b>a minor</b> may do so <b>lest she conceive and die.</b> Apparently, a minor is incapable of giving birth, as she would die first. |
| Leviticus 12:7 | her blood [ dameha ]” | Niddah 19a:19 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: <b>The verse states,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman: “And she shall be purified from the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 12:7). The plural form of the word blood, <i>dameha</i>, indicates at least two types of blood. And another verse states: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source, and she has uncovered the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>];</b> both of them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 20:18). The use of the plural form of blood once again indicates another two types, which means that <b>there are four</b> types of blood stated <b>here.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:7 | “ Dameha ” | Niddah 19a:22 | § The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, and like the liquid that drips from roast meat, are ritually impure. The Gemara asks: <b>But do Beit Shammai not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two mentions of the plural form of blood: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b> |
| Leviticus 12:7 | “ Dameha ” | Niddah 19b:2 | § The mishna states: Blood that is <b>green, Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But does Akavya</b> ben Mahalalel <b>not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two verses: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b> |
| Leviticus 12:7 | “And she shall be purified from the fountain of her blood” | Niddah 38b:17 | <b>Rava said: With this</b> response <b>Rabbi Eliezer triumphed over the Rabbis: Didn’t you say</b> that the reason why a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of blood that is emitted due to labor pains before birth is because the verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25)? The term <b>“her blood”</b> indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure due to <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child. So too,</b> one can say that as the verse states with regard to a woman who gives birth: <b>“And she shall be purified from the fountain of her blood”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), this indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is pure from <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:7 | “This is the law for one who gives birth, | Niddah 40a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>that a <i>tanna</i> taught before Rav Sheshet:</b> The verse states: <b>“This is the law for one who gives birth,</b> whether to a male or a female” (Leviticus 12:7). This <b>teaches that</b> a woman <b>brings a single offering for many offspring</b> born within a short time, e.g., after a multiple birth. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she may bring</b> an offering <b>for</b> her <b>childbirth and</b> an offering <b>for</b> an irregular <b>discharge</b> of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>], in a case where she is required to bring one, <b>as one,</b> i.e., that she may fulfill her two obligations with a single offering. |
| Leviticus 12:7 | the verse states: “This | Niddah 40a:12 | <b>Rather,</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> should be revised, as follows: One <b>might</b> have thought that a woman <b>may bring</b> an offering <b>for a childbirth that</b> occurred <b>before the completion</b> of her term of postpartum purity, <b>and for</b> a second <b>childbirth that</b> happened <b>after the completion</b> of that period, <b>as one,</b> i.e., she may fulfill her two obligations with a single offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> is the law for one who gives birth” (Leviticus 12:7), indicating that each birth, unless it occurred within the period of purity following another birth, requires its own offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this derivation? The Gemara answers that in their opinion, <b>even though it is written: “This</b> is the law,” <b>it was</b> still <b>necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“For a son, or for a daughter.”</b> |
| Leviticus 12:8 | “And she shall purchase two doves | Keritot 28a:10 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> with regard to the offering of a woman after childbirth: <b>“And she shall purchase two doves</b> or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). And with regard to the offering of a leper it is written: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice</b> the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering” (Leviticus 15:30). Together, these verses indicate that one bird is designated as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering <b>either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:8 | “And the priest shall atone for her and she shall become purified” | Sanhedrin 83b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the punishment for a priest <b>who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process and who performs the Temple service is death at the hand of Heaven. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is his punishment? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a woman after childbirth who is obligated to bring an atonement offering: <b>“And the priest shall atone for her and she shall become purified”</b> (Leviticus 12:8). He infers: As the verse states <b>“shall become purified,” by inference,</b> one concludes <b>that</b> until the priest sacrifices her atonement offering <b>she is impure</b> to a certain extent. <b>And the Master says</b> earlier in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>An impure</b> priest <b>who performs</b> the Temple <b>service</b> is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven. |
| Leviticus 12:8 | it is written: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure” | Yevamot 74b:13 | <b>Abaye said: Two verses are written with regard to a woman after childbirth: It is written:</b> “She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, <b>until the days of her purification are completed”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), which suggests that <b>once her days are completed</b> and the sun has set on the last day, <b>she is</b> completely <b>pure</b> and requires nothing more. <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 12:8), which indicates that following childbirth a woman is not completely pure until she has brought her offerings. <b>How so? Here,</b> in the first verse, it is referring <b>to <i>teruma</i>; there,</b> in the second verse, it is referring <b>to sacrificial food.</b> A woman following childbirth falls into the category of one who lacks atonement, but nevertheless the verse teaches that if she has immersed, she may eat <i>teruma</i> after sunset. The same is true of a confirmed leper and all others who lack atonement. |
| Leviticus 12:8 | written: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure” | Yevamot 74b:7 | <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Three verses are written</b> with regard to purity for eating sacred food. <b>It is written: “And he shall not eat of the holy things, unless he has bathed his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 22:6); <b>but</b> if <b>he has bathed,</b> i.e., immersed, he is immediately <b>pure</b> and may partake of sacred food. <b>And it is written: “And when the sun has set, he shall be pure, and afterward he may eat from the holy things”</b> (Leviticus 22:7), which indicates that he must wait until sunset. <b>And it is</b> further <b>written: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 12:8), which indicates that following childbirth a woman is not completely pure until she has brought her offering. <b>How so?</b> How can the apparent discrepancy between these three verses be resolved? <b>Here,</b> in the first verse, it is referring <b>to</b> second <b>tithe; there,</b> in the second verse, it is referring <b>to <i>teruma</i>;</b> and <b>here,</b> in the third verse, it is referring <b>to sacrificial food.</b> |
| Leviticus 12:8 | two verses with regard to sacrificial food, | Yevamot 75a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to that <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael and says</b> that <b>the verse</b> “Any man from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a <i>zav</i> shall not eat of the holy things until he be pure” (Leviticus 22:4) <b>is speaking of a <i>zav</i> who</b> already experienced <b>three sightings</b> of an emission, <b>and of a confirmed leper,</b> both of whom must bring an offering as part of their purification process; <b>and,</b> this being the case, <b>that</b> phrase <b>“until he be pure”</b> must mean <b>until he brings</b> his <b>atonement</b> offering; then <b>why do I</b> need <b>two verses with regard to sacrificial food,</b> this verse and the verse with regard to a woman after childbirth: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure” (Leviticus 12:8), to teach us that sacrificial food may not be eaten until after the atonement offering has been brought? |
| Leviticus 12:8 | “And she shall take | Yoma 41a:3 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> in one verse: <b>“And she shall take</b> two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering and the other for a sin-offering” (Leviticus 12:8). In another verse, it is also written: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>offer</b> them, the one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 15:15). The verses mention only the possibility of designating the offering <b>either upon taking</b> them <b>or upon</b> the <b>performance</b> of the sacrificial rite. |
| Leviticus 12:8 | “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure” | Zevachim 19b:2 | § The mishna teaches that rites performed by <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process are disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Huna says: The verse states</b> with regard to the offering brought by a woman who has given birth: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 12:8). Since the verse states: “And <b>she shall be pure,”</b> one learns <b>by inference that she is ritually impure</b> to some extent until she brings her offering, even though she has already immersed. Anyone who has not yet brought an atonement offering is likewise impure to some extent, and rites performed by one who is impure are disqualified (see 17a). |
| Leviticus 12:8 | hear | Zevachim 90a:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a further proof from a <i>baraita</i>. The Torah states that a woman who has given birth must bring a sheep as a burnt offering and a bird as a sin offering. If she is poor she may bring two birds: “One for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In <b>every</b> other <b>instance where</b> a bird offering <b>is exchanged</b> for an animal <b>sin offering,</b> the <b>sin offering precedes</b> the burnt offering. For example, in the case of the sliding scale sin offering brought for entering the Temple while ritually impure, where a poor person brings two birds, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, the sin offering comes first. <b>But here, in</b> the case of <b>a woman who gave birth,</b> the <b>burnt offering takes precedence,</b> as it takes the place of an animal burnt offering, mentioned first in the verse: “She shall bring a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering (Leviticus 12:6). |
| Leviticus 13:2 | “When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh” | Arakhin 3a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>indeed so,</b> that a minor does not become impure by means of leprous marks? The Gemara answers that the verse states: <b>“When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 13:2), to include all people, <b>in any case,</b> irrespective of age. |
| Leviticus 13:2 | “When a person shall have | Horayot 10a:16 | The Gemara asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, do</b> leprous <b>marks</b> that result from <b>circumstances beyond one’s control not cause ritual impurity? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“When a person shall have</b> in the skin of his flesh a wool-white leprous mark or a scab” (Leviticus 13:2); these <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>from</b> this <b>statement onward,</b> i.e., from the time that God gave this mitzva to the Jewish people, and these <i>halakhot</i> do not apply to leprosy that preceded the giving of the mitzva? <b>And could this not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference:</b> The Torah <b>deemed</b> one <b>impure in</b> the case of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> one <b>impure in</b> the case of leprous <b>marks. Just as a <i>zav</i></b> is ritually impure only <b>from the statement onward, so too,</b> with regard to leprous <b>marks,</b> there is impurity only <b>from that statement onward.</b> There is no need for a derivation from the verse Leviticus 13:2. |
| Leviticus 13:2 | “When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh” | Niddah 44a:6 | The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b>leprous marks.</b> The Gemara explains that this is derived from that <b>which is written</b> with regard to leprous marks: <b>“When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 13:2). This serves to include <b>anyone who is a person,</b> irrespective of age. |
| Leviticus 13:2 | the verse states: “And he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests” | Niddah 50a:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> these two <i>halakhot</i> are compared, one can also say that <b>just as disputes</b> are judged specifically <b>by three</b> judges, <b>so too, leprous marks</b> must be viewed <b>by three</b> priests. <b>And this</b> suggestion is supported by <b>a logical inference:</b> If a case that only involves <b>one’s money</b> is adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that leprous marks, which afflict the person <b>himself,</b> should be viewed by three priests? To counter this notion, <b>the verse states: “And he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests”</b> (Leviticus 13:2). <b>You</b> have <b>learned</b> from this <b>that even one priest may view leprous marks.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:2 | the verse states: “And he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one | Sanhedrin 34b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> these two matters are juxtaposed, why not say that <b>just as disputes</b> are judged specifically <b>by three</b> judges, <b>so too leprous sores</b> are viewed <b>by three</b> priests? <b>And this</b> would be supported by <b>a logical inference:</b> If a case involving one’s <b>money</b> is judged <b>by three</b> judges, is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that the person <b>himself</b> should be viewed by three priests? To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one</b> of his sons, the priests” (Leviticus 13:2). From this <b>you</b> have <b>learned that even one priest views leprous sores.</b> In any event, as opposed to the mishna, Rabbi Meir holds that disputes are judged only during the day. |
| Leviticus 13:2 | are written in the passage | Zevachim 102a:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of the examination of <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks are different, because</b> specifically <b>Aaron and his sons,</b> and not Moses, <b>are written in the passage</b> that discusses them: “Then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests” (Leviticus 13:2). Therefore, there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i> that Moses was not a priest. |
| Leviticus 13:4 | if it is a white baheret ” | Shevuot 6b:3 | § The Gemara considers the source from which the different shades of marks are derived: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that <i>baheret</i> is an intense</b> white color? <b>Abaye said: The verse states:</b> “And <b>if it is a white <i>baheret</i>”</b> (Leviticus 13:4), which indicates that <b>it</b> alone <b>is</b> a bright <b>white and there is no other</b> as <b>white</b> as it. |
| Leviticus 13:4 | is stated with regard to a se’et and “white” | Shevuot 6b:5 | <b>We found</b> a source for a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>se’et</i>; from where do we</b> derive that there is also a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>baheret</i>? Rabbi Zeira said: “White”</b> (Leviticus 13:10) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> and “white”</b> (Leviticus 13:4) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i>.</b> This teaches that <b>just as</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the mark that is the color of an egg membrane, <b>so too,</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the lime-colored mark. |
| Leviticus 13:6 | “The priest shall pronounce him clean: It is but a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be purified [ vetaher ]” | Megillah 8b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Huna.</b> It is written with regard to a leper who was purified from quarantine: <b>“The priest shall pronounce him clean: It is but a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be purified [<i>vetaher</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 13:6). The word <i>vetaher</i> is not in the future tense, which would indicate that from that point he is purified; it is rather in the present tense, indicating <b>that at the outset,</b> even before the priest’s pronouncement, <b>he was pure</b> in the sense that he was exempt <b>from</b> the initial obligation of <b>letting</b> the hair on his head grow <b>wild and rending</b> his garments, as those obligations are incumbent exclusively upon the confirmed leper. |
| Leviticus 13:9 | a leprous mark | Sanhedrin 101a:4 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> among those who have no share in the World-to-Come is <b>one who whispers</b> invocations <b>over a wound. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> that is the case only <b>where he spits into</b> the wound while he whispers, <b>as one does not mention the name of Heaven over spittle,</b> and doing so is an act of contempt for God. <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav says: Even</b> the verse: “When <b>a leprous mark</b> is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest” (Leviticus 13:9), in which there is no mention of the name of God, may not be whispered as an invocation. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Even</b> a verse that is unrelated to the specific illness in question, for example: <b>“And He called to Moses”</b> (Leviticus 1:1), may not be whispered as an invocation. |
| Leviticus 13:10 | secondary to a baheret ? Rabbi Zeira said: “White” | Shevuot 6b:5 | <b>We found</b> a source for a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>se’et</i>; from where do we</b> derive that there is also a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>baheret</i>? Rabbi Zeira said: “White”</b> (Leviticus 13:10) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> and “white”</b> (Leviticus 13:4) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i>.</b> This teaches that <b>just as</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the mark that is the color of an egg membrane, <b>so too,</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the lime-colored mark. |
| Leviticus 13:12 | “As far as the priest’s eyes can see” | Moed Katan8a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rava</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the examination is performed <b>during the day but not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“As far as the priest’s eyes can see”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), which indicates that the priest must be able to carry out a careful examination of the leprous symptoms; this cannot be done at night, when his vision is limited. <b>And Abaye</b> could say that <b>this</b> verse <b>is necessary to exclude</b> a priest who is <b>blind in one eye</b> from inspecting symptoms of leprosy, as it says “eyes,” in the plural. |
| Leviticus 13:12 | as it is written: “As far as appears to the priest” | Niddah 50a:2 | <b>And just as leprous marks</b> are seen by priests who can see, but <b>not by blind</b> priests, <b>as it is written: “As far as appears to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), which teaches that they must be viewed by priests who can see with both eyes, <b>so too, disputes are not</b> adjudicated <b>by blind judges,</b> even if they are blind in only one eye. <b>And</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes leprous marks to disputes</b> to teach that <b>just as disputes may not</b> be judged <b>by relatives</b> of the litigants, <b>so too, leprous marks may not</b> be viewed <b>by</b> a priest who is <b>a relative</b> of the afflicted party. |
| Leviticus 13:12 | as it is written: “As far as appears to the priest” | Sanhedrin 34b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes disputes to leprous sores,</b> teaching that <b>just as leprous sores</b> are viewed by a priest only <b>in the daytime, as it is written: “And on the day when</b> raw flesh <b>appears in him</b> he shall be impure” (Leviticus 13:14), <b>so too disputes</b> are judged only <b>in the daytime. And just as leprous sores</b> are viewed by a priest who can see, but <b>not by blind</b> priests, <b>as it is written: “As far as appears to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), <b>so too disputes</b> are judged by sighted judges, <b>not by blind judges. And</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes leprous sores to disputes,</b> teaching that <b>just as disputes</b> are judged by independent judges, <b>not by</b> judges who are <b>relatives</b> of the litigants, <b>so too leprous sores</b> are viewed <b>by</b> a priest who is <b>not a relative</b> of the afflicted person. |
| Leviticus 13:12 | from his head to his feet, | Zevachim 49b:18 | The Gemara continues its proof: <b>But there,</b> with regard to the head, which serves as the source for this verbal analogy, <b>from where do we</b> derive that if the leprosy spreads throughout the head he is pure? <b>As it is written:</b> “And if the leprosy breaks out on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the mark, <b>from his head to his feet,</b> as far as it appears to the priest” (Leviticus 13:12). <b>And</b> the verse thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> leprosy on <b>his head to</b> leprosy on his <b>foot,</b> teaching the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to leprosy of the body and foot, if <b>its entirety turned white,</b> and it <b>spread all over him,</b> he is <b>pure, so too here,</b> in the case of leprosy of the head, if <b>its entirety turned white and it spread over all his</b> head, he is <b>pure.</b> Evidently, a matter derived via a juxtaposition can then teach its <i>halakha</i> to another matter via a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 13:13 | pure, | Niddah 19a:16 | <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a person, if the leprosy <b>spread to his entire</b> body he is <b>pure,</b> as the verse states: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce pure the one who has the leprous mark; it is all turned white: He is pure” (Leviticus 13:13), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to garments, if the leprosy <b>spread to</b> the <b>entire</b> garment it is <b>pure.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:13 | it is all turned white: He is pure” | Niddah 19a:8 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> then does the other expression in the verse: <b>“Between leprous mark and leprous mark,” also</b> mean: <b>Between a pure leprous mark and an impure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is what it means, <b>is there</b> a type of <b>pure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that there is in fact a pure leprous mark, according to the verse: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce pure the one that has the leprous mark; <b>it is all turned white: He is pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:13), <b>that</b> mark is not classified as a leprous mark; rather, it <b>is called a paleness,</b> as a leprous mark is by definition impure. |
| Leviticus 13:13 | “It is all turned white; he is ritually pure” | Sanhedrin 97a:9 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: During the generation that the son of David comes, arrogance will proliferate and the cost</b> of living <b>will corrupt</b> people so they will engage in deceit. <b>The vine will produce its fruit, and</b> nevertheless, <b>the wine</b> will be <b>costly. And the entire</b> gentile <b>monarchy will be converted to</b> the <b>heresy</b> of Christianity, <b>and there will be no</b> inclination among the people to accept <b>rebuke.</b> This <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The son of David will not come until the entire kingdom will be converted to heresy. Rava says: What is the verse</b> from which this statement is derived? It is the verse: <b>“It is all turned white; he is ritually pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:13). One is a leper and ritually impure only if he has a leprous mark, however small, but not if his skin is completely leprous. Similarly, the world will be redeemed only when the Jewish people reach their lowest point. |
| Leviticus 13:13 | pure, | Zevachim 49b:17 | <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a person, if the leprosy <b>spread throughout him</b> entirely he is <b>pure,</b> as the verse states: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all of his flesh, he shall pronounce the one who has the mark pure; it is all turned white: He is pure” (Leviticus 13:13), <b>so too here</b> with regard to garments, if the leprosy <b>spread throughout the entire</b> garment it is <b>pure.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:14 | twenty-four extremities in a person, none of which can become ritually impure due to unaffected skin. | Kiddushin 25a:4 | After this encounter Rav Hamnuna <b>came before Rav Ḥisda</b> and told him what had happened. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: They raised before you a dilemma</b> that can be resolved from <b>a <i>baraita</i>,</b> which was cited in connection to a mishna, and you did not know how to answer them. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 6:7): There are <b>twenty-four extremities in a person, none of which can become ritually impure due to unaffected skin.</b> The Torah states that if a leprous spot contains some healthy flesh, the person is immediately rendered impure (Leviticus 13:14). The <i>halakha</i> of unaffected skin does not apply to the extremities because the priest must be able to see the entirety of the untainted area at once. Due to the shape of the twenty-four extremities, it is impossible to see the entirety of the area from a single vantage point. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of unaffected skin does not apply to them. |
| Leviticus 13:14 | “But on the day it appears in him” | Moed Katan7b:9 | § The Gemara returns to the original dispute with regard to the priest’s examination of the symptoms of leprosy. <b>Is this to say that the matter depends upon</b> the discretion of <b>the priest,</b> i.e., the priest can decide whether to declare the affected person ritually pure or impure or whether to examine the leprous symptoms or not? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and</b> so too <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“But on the day it appears in him”</b> (Leviticus 13:14), from which it may be inferred that <b>there is a day when you examine</b> the symptoms found in <b>him and there is a day when you do not examine</b> those symptoms. |
| Leviticus 13:14 | said: It was necessary | Moed Katan8a:2 | <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It was necessary</b> for the Torah to state both verses: “But on the day it appears in him” (Leviticus 13:14), as well as: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house” (Leviticus 14:36). <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“But on the day it appears in him,” I would have said</b> that <b>for a matter of mitzva, yes,</b> one may delay the priest’s examination of the leprous symptoms, but <b>for an optional matter, no,</b> one may not, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Therefore <b>the Merciful One wrote: “Then the priest shall command,”</b> in order to teach that one may delay his examination even for an optional matter. |
| Leviticus 13:14 | appears in him | Niddah 50a:1 | <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “According to their word shall every dispute and every leprous mark be”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:5)? <b>What do disputes have to do with leprous marks?</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes disputes to leprous marks,</b> to teach that <b>just as leprous marks</b> are viewed by a priest only <b>in the daytime, as it is written</b> with regard to leprous marks: <b>“And on the day when</b> raw flesh <b>appears in him</b> he shall be impure” (Leviticus 13:14), <b>so too, disputes</b> are adjudicated only <b>in the daytime.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:14 | appears in him | Sanhedrin 34b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes disputes to leprous sores,</b> teaching that <b>just as leprous sores</b> are viewed by a priest only <b>in the daytime, as it is written: “And on the day when</b> raw flesh <b>appears in him</b> he shall be impure” (Leviticus 13:14), <b>so too disputes</b> are judged only <b>in the daytime. And just as leprous sores</b> are viewed by a priest who can see, but <b>not by blind</b> priests, <b>as it is written: “As far as appears to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), <b>so too disputes</b> are judged by sighted judges, <b>not by blind judges. And</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes leprous sores to disputes,</b> teaching that <b>just as disputes</b> are judged by independent judges, <b>not by</b> judges who are <b>relatives</b> of the litigants, <b>so too leprous sores</b> are viewed <b>by</b> a priest who is <b>not a relative</b> of the afflicted person. |
| Leviticus 13:18 | and it is healed” | Sotah 5a:19 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Concerning leprosy of the <b>flesh, it is written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to it:</b> “And when the flesh has in the skin thereof a boil, <b>and it is healed”</b> (Leviticus 13:18), but concerning the leprosy of <b>a person, it is not written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to it: And it is healed.</b> Both verses discussing leprosy of a person make no mention of healing (Leviticus 13:2, 13:9). This indicates that one who sees himself as flesh will be cured, but one who holds himself in high regard will not be cured. |
| Leviticus 13:23 | “But if the white leprous spot stays in its place [ taḥteha ]” | Temurah 27a:1 | <b>“But if the white leprous spot stays in its place [<i>taḥteha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 13:23). In this verse, the word “<i>taḥteha</i>” indicates that the white leprous spot remains in its place. This usage of the word is fitting for substitution, since when sanctity is transferred by substitution from a consecrated animal to a non-sacred animal, the sanctity of the consecrated animal remains in place, despite the fact that the non-sacred animal is also consecrated. |
| Leviticus 13:24 | a burn from fire” | Pesachim 75a:9 | Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami <b>raised a contradiction</b> based on the Torah’s statement with regard to the laws of leprosy: “Or flesh that shall have on its skin <b>a burn from fire”</b> (Leviticus 13:24). From the fact that it says a burn from fire, I have derived <b>nothing other</b> than a case in which <b>it is burned by fire</b> itself; if it <b>is burned by a coal, by burning ash, by burning lime, by burning plaster [<i>gipsis</i>], or</b> by <b>anything</b> else that is burning <b>and</b> whose source of heat <b>comes from fire, to include</b> also <b>water heated by fire, from where</b> is it derived that these are also considered a burn from fire? <b>The verse states: A burn, a burn,</b> twice. By repeating the term, <b>it includes</b> all these types of burns. |
| Leviticus 13:25 | states: “And its appearance is deeper than the skin” | Shevuot 6b:4 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The bright shade of <b>a <i>baheret</i></b> makes it appear <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding skin, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:25). This is <b>like the appearance of</b> an area illuminated by the <b>sun, which</b> appears <b>deeper than</b> the area in <b>the shade.</b> The darker shade of <b>a <i>se’et</i></b> makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word <b><i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than raised, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [<i>hanissaot</i>] hills”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). The words <i>hanissaot</i> and <i>se’et</i> share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>” (Leviticus 14:56), the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other than secondary, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And he will say: Append me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>] please</b> to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36). This teaches that there is a leprous mark that is secondary and appended to a <i>se’et</i>. This is a mark that is the color of an egg membrane. |
| Leviticus 13:29 | ritual impurity from leprosy, it is written explicitly: “And when a man or woman has a plague upon the head or upon the beard” | Kiddushin 35b:14 | The Gemara objects: Concerning <b>ritual impurity from leprosy, it is written explicitly: “And when a man or woman has a plague upon the head or upon the beard”</b> (Leviticus 13:29). This indicates that there is no difference between a man and woman with regard to the beard in the case of leprosy. The <i>baraita</i> would not state a <i>halakha</i> that is explicit in the verse. <b>Rather, Mar Zutra says:</b> This <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to ritual purification from leprosy,</b> i.e., women can also be purified from leprosy of the beard. |
| Leviticus 13:30 | “And, behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin” | Bava Batra84a:6 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this claim: With regard to a verse that speaks of leprosy: <b>“And, behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), the Sages explain: This means that it is <b>like the appearance of the sun,</b> which is <b>deeper than the shadow. But there,</b> leprosy <b>is white</b> and yet it is likened to the sun. The Gemara answers: There, it means that it <b>has an appearance like the sun</b> in certain respects, <b>but</b> it is <b>not like the appearance of the sun</b> in all respects. It is <b>like the appearance of the sun</b> in <b>that</b> it is <b>deeper than the shadow, and</b> it is <b>not</b> entirely <b>like the appearance of the sun, as there</b> the leprous spot is <b>white, and here</b> the sun is <b>red.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:30 | “And its appearance is deeper than the skin” | Bekhorot 41a:20 | <b>Rava said:</b> Even <b>without</b> the comparison to <b>“broken,” you cannot say that a crack in the location of flesh,</b> where there is no bone, <b>is a blemish. As, if</b> it would <b>enter your mind</b> that <b>it is a blemish, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>said</b> with regard to <b>“<i>garav</i>”</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to boils that are hard as <b>earthenware [<i>ḥeres</i>],</b> evidently this blemish is <b>a crack</b> in the skin, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the skin disease of leprosy: <b>“And its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), and the Sages explained: <b>It is similar to the appearance of</b> an area lit by the <b>sun that</b> seems <b>deeper than the shade,</b> which appears to cover it. |
| Leviticus 13:30 | “If the appearance thereof be deeper [ amok ] than the skin” | Chullin 63a:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>The Master said:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the crow. Is that to say</b> that the particular crow <b>stands before us,</b> such that one immediately knows which one it is? <b>Rather, say:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the black crow, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “His locks are curled, and black as a crow”</b> (Song of Songs 5:11). The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The valley</b> crow <b>[<i>ha’amaki</i>]</b> is the <b>white</b> crow. <b>And so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to leprosy: <b>“If the appearance thereof be deeper [<i>amok</i>] than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), and the Sages explained: <b>As the appearance of</b> an area lit by the <b>sun, which</b> seems <b>deeper than the shade,</b> which appears to cover it. There is therefore an association between a valley and the color white. |
| Leviticus 13:33 | “Then he shall be shaven” | Kiddushin 30a:11 | <b>Therefore,</b> because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the <b>first</b> Sages <b>were called: Those who count [<i>soferim</i>],</b> because <b>they would count all the letters in the Torah, as they would say</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:42) <b>is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll.</b> The words: <b>“Diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), <b>are the midpoint of the words</b> in a Torah scroll. And the verse that begins with: <b>“Then he shall be shaven”</b> (Leviticus 13:33), is the midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>verses.</b> Similarly, in the expression: <b>“The boar out of the wood [<i>miya’ar</i>] ravages it”</b> (Psalms 80:14), <b>the <i>ayin</i> in</b> the word wood <b>[<i>ya’ar</i>]</b> is the <b>midpoint of Psalms,</b> with regard to its number of letters. The verse: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity”</b> (Psalms 78:38), <b>is the midpoint</b> of <b>verses</b> in the book of Psalms. |
| Leviticus 13:42 | a person: | Niddah 19a:15 | It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and, behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white mark, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42). |
| Leviticus 13:42 | a person: | Zevachim 49b:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan ben Avtolemos says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if leprosy <b>of garments spreads</b> throughout an entire garment <b>that it is pure?</b> It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42). |
| Leviticus 13:44 | man” | Arakhin 3a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>why do I</b> need the term: “He is a leprous <b>man”</b> (Leviticus 13:44)? The Gemara answers: It comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase “he is a leprous <b>man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a leprous <b>man. From where</b> is it derived that leprous marks also render <b>a woman</b> impure? <b>When</b> the subsequent verse <b>states: “And the leper</b> in whom the affliction is” (Leviticus 13:45), <b>there are two</b> individuals indicated <b>here,</b> male and female, as this verse did not need to restate: “And the leper,” since the subject of this clause was clear from the previous verse. |
| Leviticus 13:44 | a leprous man, | Arakhin 3a:8 | The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 3:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>leprous marks?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor.</b> As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “He is <b>a leprous man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44), this is teaching that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he does become impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a minor becomes impure by means of leprous marks. |
| Leviticus 13:44 | garments, as it is taught | Keritot 8b:10 | <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>a female leper does not require letting</b> her <b>hair grow wild and rending</b> her <b>garments, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “He is a leprous man” (Leviticus 13:44): <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> can be a leper; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> can also be a leper? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And the leper</b> in whom the mark is” (Leviticus 13:45), without specifying a man, the verse teaches that <b>there are two here,</b> i.e., a man and a woman. |
| Leviticus 13:44 | man, | Sotah 23b:6 | § The mishna states: <b>And what</b> are the halakhic differences <b>between a man</b> and a woman? A man lets his hair grow and rends his garments when he is a leper, but a woman does not. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “He is a leprous <b>man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of a confirmed leper apply to <b>a man; from where</b> do I derive that they apply to <b>a woman? When it says</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“And the leper in whom</b> the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall grow wild and he shall cover his upper lip; and he shall cry: Impure, impure” (Leviticus 13:45), <b>there are two</b> individuals indicated <b>here,</b> as this verse did not need to restate “and the leper,” as the subject of the verse was clear from the previous verse. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | states: “And the leper | Arakhin 3a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>why do I</b> need the term: “He is a leprous <b>man”</b> (Leviticus 13:44)? The Gemara answers: It comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase “he is a leprous <b>man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a leprous <b>man.

| Leviticus 13:45 | below: | Arakhin 3a:11 | <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “A leprous <b>man”?</b> This is referring <b>to the matter of</b> the leper rending his clothes and letting his hair grow wild, which is stated in the verse <b>below:</b> “His clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose” (Leviticus 13:45). The verse therefore teaches that <b>a man</b> who is a leper <b>lets</b> his hair <b>grow and rends</b> his garments, <b>but a woman</b> who is a leper <b>does not let</b> her hair <b>grow and</b> does not <b>rend</b> her garments. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | and he shall cry: Unclean, unclean” | Bava Kamma92b:1 | The verse states with regard to one diagnosed with leprosy: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, <b>and he shall cry: Unclean, unclean”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). Not only must the leper suffer from the leprosy itself; he must undergo further embarrassment by publicizing his condition. This is akin to the aphorism that poverty follows the poor. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And he will cry: Impure, impure” | Chullin 78a:2 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And he will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), that a leper must publicize the fact that he is ritually impure. <b>He must announce</b> his pain <b>to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf. And likewise, one to whom</b> any unfortunate <b>matter happens must announce</b> it <b>to the masses, and</b> then <b>the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:45 | states: “And the leper | Keritot 8b:10 | <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>a female leper does not require letting</b> her <b>hair grow wild and rending</b> her <b>garments, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “He is a leprous man” (Leviticus 13:44): <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> can be a leper; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> can also be a leper? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And the leper</b> in whom the mark is” (Leviticus 13:45), without specifying a man, the verse teaches that <b>there are two here,</b> i.e., a man and a woman. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | garments, as it is written: “His garments shall be rent and the hair of his head shall go wild” | Keritot 8b:9 | The Gemara objects: But <b>the impurities of a male leper and a female leper are also distinct, as a male leper requires letting</b> his <b>hair grow wild and rending</b> his <b>garments, as it is written: “His garments shall be rent and the hair of his head shall go wild”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), <b>and he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And the leper in whom [ bo ] the plague is, | Megillah 8b:13 | <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that a quarantined leper is exempt from the obligation to let his hair grow and to rend his clothing is derived <b>from here.</b> It is written: <b>“And the leper in whom [<i>bo</i>] the plague is,</b> his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall grow wild” (Leviticus 13:45), indicating that only <b>one whose leprosy is dependent on</b> the state of <b>his body,</b> in whom the plague is, is obligated to let his hair grow wild and to rend his garments. This <b>excludes that</b> leper <b>whose leprosy is not dependent</b> solely <b>on</b> the state of <b>his body, but rather on</b> the passage of <b>days,</b> as he is obligated to wait seven days. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And the leper | Moed Katan14b:20 | <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source. The verse states: <b>“And the leper</b> in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent” (Leviticus 13:45). The extra emphasis of the phrase: “And the leper” comes <b>to include the High Priest,</b> teaching that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the leper apply to him. <b>And</b> the status of <b>the High Priest</b> during <b>the entire year is like</b> that of <b>everyone on a Festival, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 12b): The <b>High Priest sacrifices</b> animals when he has the status of <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., before the burial of a close relative who died, <b>but he may not eat</b> of the offering. <b>Learn from it</b> that a leper <b>practices the customs of his leprosy during the Festival.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is so. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And he shall cover his upper lip” | Moed Katan15a:12 | The Gemara continues and asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>greeting</b> others? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall cover his upper lip”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). This means that <b>his lips should be stuck together, that he should be like one who is ostracized and like a mourner, and he is prohibited from greeting</b> others or being greeted. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is so. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “His garments shall be rent” | Moed Katan15a:24 | The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>rending? Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“His garments shall be rent”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), meaning <b>that they shall be torn.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And he shall cover his upper lip” | Moed Katan15a:5 | The Gemara continues and asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>wrapping of the head? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based upon the verse: <b>“And he shall cover his upper lip”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), from which it may be learned <b>by inference that he is obligated to wrap</b> his <b>head.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And the leper” | Moed Katan15a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who is ostracized,</b> with regard to phylacteries? The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. The Gemara proceeds to its next question: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a leper</b> with regard to phylacteries? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the leper”</b> (Leviticus 13:45); as explained earlier, this comes <b>to include the High Priest</b> in all the <i>halakhot</i> of the leper. The verse states there: <b>“His garments shall be <i>perumim</i>,”</b> meaning <b>that they shall be rent.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And his head shall be <i>parua</i>,”</b> and this <b><i>peria</i></b> means <b>only growing the hair long;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:45 | shall cry: Impure, impure” | Moed Katan5a:16 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> An allusion to the marking of graves may be derived <b>from here:</b> “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and <b>shall cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). This verse teaches that <b>impurity cries out</b> to the passerby <b>and tells him: Remove yourself.</b> The leper must inform others of his status so that they know not to come into contact with him and thereby maintain their ritual purity. So too, in our case, graves must be marked so that others will know to avoid them and prevent contracting ritual impurity. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Uzziel, grandson of Rabbi Uzziel the Great, said: Impurity cries out</b> to the passerby <b>and tells him: Remove yourself.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:45 | and will cry: Impure, impure” | Niddah 66a:14 | <b>Some say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: Reveal</b> this fact <b>to your friends, so that</b> those women <b>who were</b> against <b>you on this side,</b> and gossiped about you, <b>will be</b> with <b>you on that side,</b> and be kind to you. <b>And some say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: Reveal</b> this fact <b>to your friends, in order that they will pray for mercy for you, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse: “And the leper in whom the mark is, his clothes shall be ripped and the hair of his head shall grow long and he will put a covering upon his upper lip <b>and will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). The leper publicizes the fact that he is ritually impure, as he <b>must announce his pain to the masses, and</b> then <b>the masses will pray for mercy on his</b> behalf. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | and he shall cover his upper lip [ ya’te ]” | Sanhedrin 26a:26 | With regard to the phrase: <b>“And he will wind you round and round,” Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Shebna <b>developed leprosy; it is written here: “And he will wind you round and round [<i>ve’otkha ato</i>],” and it is written there,</b> in the Torah, with regard to a leper: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall go loose, <b>and he shall cover his upper lip [<i>ya’te</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). The Hebrew word for upper lip is from the same root as the verb in the verse cited from Isaiah. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | and will cry: Impure, impure” | Shabbat 67a:16 | The Gemara explains: He does so <b>so that people will see</b> the tree <b>and pray for mercy for it. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be ripped and the hair of his head shall grow long and he will put a covering upon his upper lip <b>and will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). The leper publicizes the fact that he is ritually impure because <b>he must announce his pain to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his</b> behalf. <b>Ravina said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we hang bunches of</b> unripe <b>dates on a palm tree</b> that casts off its dates? <b>According to that <i>tanna</i></b> who taught that one must publicize his pain to the masses. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And the leper in whom | Sotah 23b:6 | § The mishna states: <b>And what</b> are the halakhic differences <b>between a man</b> and a woman? A man lets his hair grow and rends his garments when he is a leper, but a woman does not. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “He is a leprous <b>man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of a confirmed leper apply to <b>a man; from where</b> do I derive that they apply to <b>a woman? When it says</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“And the leper in whom</b> the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall grow wild and he shall cover his upper lip; and he shall cry: Impure, impure” (Leviticus 13:45), <b>there are two</b> individuals indicated <b>here,</b> as this verse did not need to restate “and the leper,” as the subject of the verse was clear from the previous verse. |
| Leviticus 13:45 | “And will cry: Impure, impure” | Sotah 32b:12 | The Gemara corrects the previous statement: <b>Do not say</b> that one should say that which is to <b>his discredit</b> in a loud voice; <b>rather, say</b> that one should publicize <b>his pain</b> in a loud voice. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), that a leper must publicize the fact that he is ritually impure. <b>He must announce his pain to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf. And</b> similarly, <b>anyone to whom</b> a painful <b>matter happens must announce it to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:46 | a leper, that the Torah states: “He shall dwell alone; outside of the camp shall be his dwelling” | Arakhin 16b:2 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nadav asked Rabbi Ḥanina, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nadav, the son-in-law of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who asked <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, and some say</b> that he asked it <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: What is different</b> and notable about <b>a leper, that the Torah states: “He shall dwell alone; outside of the camp shall be his dwelling”</b> (Leviticus 13:46)? He replied: By speaking malicious speech <b>he separated between husband and wife</b> and <b>between</b> one <b>person and another; therefore</b> he is punished with leprosy, and <b>the Torah says: “He shall dwell alone;</b> outside of the camp shall be his dwelling.” |
| Leviticus 13:46 | it is written: “He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his dwelling be” | Berakhot 25a:11 | <b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> in the case of leprosy, <b>it is contingent upon the permanence</b> of the place, <b>as</b> with regard to the leper <b>it is written: “He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his dwelling be”</b> (Leviticus 13:46). His impurity is in his permanent dwelling-place. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the obligation to distance oneself from something repulsive, <b>the Torah stated</b> the principle: <b>“And your camp shall be holy”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), <b>and there is no</b> holiness in those circumstances. |
| Leviticus 13:46 | “All the days during which the plague shall be in him [ bo ] he shall be impure” | Megillah 8b:14 | <b>Abaye said to him: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> then also with regard to the verse: <b>“All the days during which the plague shall be in him [<i>bo</i>] he shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:46), say <b>one whose leprosy is dependent on</b> the state of <b>his body requires expulsion</b> from the camp, <b>and one whose leprosy is not dependent</b> solely <b>on</b> the state of <b>his body,</b> but rather on the passage of days, <b>does not require expulsion.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:46 | he shall dwell in isolation, his dwelling shall be outside the camp” | Pesachim 67a:7 | Having cited verses dealing with the requirement to send out the ritually impure from the camp, the Gemara addresses several <i>halakhot</i> relevant to that topic. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A leper,</b> who must be sent out from all of the camps including the Israelite camp, <b>who went in beyond his boundary,</b> that is, he entered an area that is prohibited to him, <b>is</b> nonetheless <b>exempt</b> from the punishment of lashes. With regard to the ritually impure, the Torah states: “Both male and female shall you send out, outside the camp shall you send them, and they shall defile not their camps in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3), from which we learn that an impure person who enters the camp is liable to receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of “they shall not defile.” A leper, however, is exempt, <b>as it is stated:</b> “All the days that the plague shall be in him he shall be impure; he is impure, <b>he shall dwell in isolation, his dwelling shall be outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 13:46). |
| Leviticus 13:46 | “He shall dwell alone; | Zevachim 117a:3 | <b>Rava said to him: Rather, what</b> would you say instead? Would you say that <b>the Israelite camp was not</b> present in Shiloh? If so, it would be <b>found</b> that <b><i>zavim</i> and lepers are</b> both <b>sent to one place,</b> i.e., outside the Levite camp. <b>But the Torah said</b> with regard to the leper: <b>“He shall dwell alone;</b> outside the camp shall his dwelling be” (Leviticus 13:46). The word “alone” teaches <b>that another ritually impure person should not dwell with him.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:47 | a woolen garment, or a linen garment” | Bekhorot 17a:18 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> likewise <b>says: Everyone concedes that its wool does not become ritually impure with</b> leprous <b>marks, as it is stated:</b> “And when the mark of leprosy is <b>in</b> a garment, whether it be <b>a woolen garment, or a linen garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:47). <b>Just as</b> the <b>linen</b> of a garment <b>has not changed, so too,</b> only a garment made of <b>wool</b> from an animal <b>that has not changed</b> can become impure with leprous marks. |
| Leviticus 13:47 | wool or linen, | Menachot 39b:14 | <b>As</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since</b> the word <b>garments is</b> usually <b>stated in the Torah without specification</b> as to the material from which the garments are made, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references to garments that it is referring to garments made from <b>wool or linen,</b> as it states: “And the garment in which there will be the mark of leprosy, whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment” (Leviticus 13:47), it may be derived that <b>so too, all</b> garments mentioned in the Torah are those made from <b>wool or linen.</b> Other fabrics are not classified as garments by Torah law. Consequently, when the Torah requires strings on the corners of garments (see Numbers 15:38), it is referring specifically to garments made of wool or linen. |
| Leviticus 13:47 | garment” | Menachot 39b:15 | <b>Abaye said: This</b> statement by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael diverges from another</b> statement by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that all fabrics are considered garments. <b>As</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> From the fact that the verse states: “A woolen <b>garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:47), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a garment of wool</b> can become ritually impure. <b>From where</b> is it derived that garments made of <b>camels’ hair, rabbits’ wool, goats’ hair, or</b> the types of silk <b><i>kalakh</i>, <i>serikin</i>, and <i>shirayin</i>,</b> are also <b>included</b> in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Or</b> a linen <b>garment.”</b> The word “or” serves as an amplification to include all types of fabric. |
| Leviticus 13:47 | wool and linen: | Shabbat 26b:1 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> and the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> essentially <b>said the same thing,</b> even though they said it in different ways. The Gemara elaborates: The statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> is <b>that which we said:</b> The only fabrics woven from plant materials that are considered bona fide fabrics are those made of linen. <b>What is</b> the statement of the <b><i>tanna</i> from the school</b> of <b>Rabbi Yishmael? As it was taught</b> in <b>the school</b> of <b>Rabbi Yishmael: Since</b> the word <b>garments is stated in the Torah unmodified,</b> without stating from what materials those garments were made, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references to garments, in the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity of leprosy, <b>wool and linen:</b> “And the garment in which there will be the plague of leprosy, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment” (Leviticus 13:47), the conclusion can be drawn: <b>Just as below,</b> when it mentions a garment in the case of leprosy, the Torah is referring to one made of <b>wool</b> or <b>linen, so too, all</b> garments mentioned in the Torah are those made from <b>wool</b> or <b>linen.</b> Other fabrics are not classified as garments. |
| Leviticus 13:47 | The verse states: “And the garment | Shabbat 26b:3 | <b>In any case,</b> based on the above, <b>everyone agrees</b> that, clearly, <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths <b>in</b> a <b>wool</b> or <b>linen</b> garment can <b>become ritually impure with</b> the impurity of <b>leprosy.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara responds that it is derived <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this matter. When the Torah states: <b>Garment,</b> unmodified, <b>I have</b> derived that <b>nothing other</b> than a whole <b>garment</b> can become ritually impure. However, with regard to a cloth that is <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>from where</b> do I derive that it is also included in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “And the garment</b> in which there will be the plague of leprosy” (Leviticus 13:47). From the addition of the word: And the garment [<i>vehabeged</i>], it is derived that all woven swatches are subsumed within the category of garment in this matter. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps <b>say</b> that it comes <b>to include</b> a woven garment that is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths? The Gemara answers: That is inconceivable. <b>Is that not</b> derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference?</b> As, <b>now,</b> even the threads of the <b>warp</b> or the threads of the <b>woof</b> can <b>become ritually impure, is it necessary</b> to mention that a cloth <b>three by three</b> handbreadths can become ritually impure as well? A garment that is three by three handbreadths is comprised of several warp and woof threads that can themselves become ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 13:47 | “A woolen garment or a linen garment” | Yevamot 4b:6 | How so? <b>Since it is written: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds mingled together”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since</b> the word <b>garments is stated in the Torah unmodified,</b> without stating from what materials those garments were made, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references to garments, in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity of leprosy: <b>“A woolen garment or a linen garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:47), the following conclusion can be drawn: Just as when the Torah mentions a garment in the case of leprosy it is referring to one made of wool or linen, <b>so too, all</b> garments mentioned in the Torah are those made from <b>wool or linen.</b> Other fabrics are not classified as those used for garments. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“Wool and linen” that the Merciful One wrote</b> with regard to diverse kinds? <b>Learn from this that</b> the superfluous passage is <b>free.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:48 | from here, as it was taught | Shabbat 28a:5 | <b>Rava said</b> that the proof that <b>the hide of a non-kosher animal becomes ritually impure in a tent over a corpse</b> is derived <b>from here, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated in the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity of leprosy that the leprosy could be: “Either in the warp, or in the woof, whether they be of linen, or of wool; or in a hide, or in any thing made of hide” (Leviticus 13:48). The verse could have simply stated: <b>Or hide,</b> and it said instead: <b>Or in a hide.</b> The Sages said: These words, or in a hide, <b>amplify</b> to include <b>the hide of a non-kosher animal</b> as well as hide <b>that was afflicted in the hands of a priest,</b> i.e., before the owner showed it to the priest there was no leprosy but it became leprous while in the hands of the priest, that they too become ritually impure. If <b>one cut</b> pieces from each of these types <b>and made of them a single</b> cloth, <b>from where</b> is it derived that it can become ritually impure? <b>The verse states</b> from the broader amplification: <b>Or in anything made of hide.</b> The Gemara remarks: <b>There is</b> room <b>to refute</b> this parallel, rendering it impossible to derive the laws of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse from the laws of leprosy. <b>What</b> is the comparison <b>to leprosy</b> with regard to which the Torah is stringent, <b>as</b> even <b>the warp and woof</b> that have not been woven into a garment <b>can become ritually impure from it,</b> which is not the case in impurity imparted by a corpse? |
| Leviticus 13:52 | is different, as the verse states: “And he shall burn the garment” | Yevamot 103b:17 | The Gemara answers: That is correct; the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a rag with confirmed leprosy, but nevertheless it is not difficult for Rav Pappi. Although generally objects that are required to be burnt are considered crushed even before they are burnt, this is not true with regard to a garment with leprosy. <b>There</b> the <i>halakha</i> for a garment that has confirmed leprosy <b>is different, as the verse states: “And he shall burn the garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:52), which indicates that <b>even when it is being burned, it is still called a garment.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:54 | with intent, | Chullin 31b:13 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse dealing with the purification of a leprous garment, which must be laundered, quarantined for a week, and then immersed in a ritual bath: “And the garment…that you shall wash and the leprosy departed from them, and it shall be washed a second time and shall be pure” (Leviticus 13:58). <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> It would have been sufficient for the verse to simply state: <b>And it shall be washed</b> and shall be pure. For <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state: “A second time”?</b> The Torah <b>juxtaposes the second washing,</b> the immersion, <b>with the first washing,</b> the laundering. <b>Just as the first washing is</b> performed <b>with intent,</b> as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they wash the garment that has the leprous mark, and he shall quarantine it seven days more” (Leviticus 13:54), <b>so too, the second washing,</b> the immersion in a ritual bath, must be performed <b>with intent.</b> |
| Leviticus 13:55 | garments: | Niddah 19a:15 | It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and, behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white mark, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42). |
| Leviticus 13:55 | garments: | Zevachim 49b:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan ben Avtolemos says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if leprosy <b>of garments spreads</b> throughout an entire garment <b>that it is pure?</b> It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42). |
| Leviticus 13:58 | As it is taught | Chullin 31b:13 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse dealing with the purification of a leprous garment, which must be laundered, quarantined for a week, and then immersed in a ritual bath: “And the garment…that you shall wash and the leprosy departed from them, and it shall be washed a second time and shall be pure” (Leviticus 13:58). <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> It would have been sufficient for the verse to simply state: <b>And it shall be washed</b> and shall be pure.

| Leviticus 13:58 | the verse states: “And shall be pure” | Chullin 31b:14 | <b>If</b> so, based on the same juxtaposition, perhaps derive: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the first washing, <b>we require the intent of a priest,</b> who commands to wash the garment, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the second washing, <b>we require the intent of a priest.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:58), indicating that there is purity <b>in any case</b> where there is intent, even without a command from a priest. In the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef, even the immersion of the non-sacred garment must be performed with intent. Rav Yosef states that Rabbi Yoḥanan bases his statement on Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef’s opinion. |
| Leviticus 13:58 | “And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any article of leather that you shall wash” | Zevachim 94a:11 | § <b>Rava said: And is there anyone who says</b> that <b>leather is not suitable for laundering? But isn’t it written</b> with regard to leprosy: <b>“And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any article of leather that you shall wash”</b> (Leviticus 13:58)? <b>Rather, Rava said: The verse</b> that speaks of leprosy <b>and the mishna</b> that speaks of the sin offering are ruling <b>with regard to soft</b> leather, which is considered subject to laundering. In the <i>baraita</i>, <b>when</b> the Rabbis and the others <b>disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> an item that is made of <b>hard</b> leather; as the Rabbis hold that laundering does not apply to hard leather. |
| Leviticus 13:59 | to pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure” | Moed Katan7b:1 | <b>it is with regard to</b> a suspected leper who is already in his <b>second</b> week of <b>quarantine. One Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>the matter depends upon</b> the discretion of <b>the priest; if he is</b> found ritually <b>pure, the priest declares him pure, and if he is</b> found <b>ritually impure, the priest</b> can <b>remain silent.</b> As long as the priest does not declare the affected individual ritually impure, he does not become impure. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that since <b>it is written:</b> “This is the law of the plague of leprosy…<b>to pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:59), the priest is not permitted to be silent; just as he is obligated to declare him pure when that is the case, so too, he is bound to declare him impure when his symptoms indicate impurity. |
| Leviticus 13:59 | to pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure” | Nazir 65b:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The verse states:</b> “This is the law of the plague of leprosy…<b>to pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:59). <b>Since the verse opened with purity first,</b> this teaches that any case of uncertainty concerning leprous sores is deemed pure. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the <i>halakha</i> is based on this verse, then <b>even once</b> it <b>has been determined</b> to be a case <b>of impurity, uncertainty</b> concerning <b>it</b> should be deemed <b>pure as well,</b> as this interpretation of the verse should apply to all cases of uncertainty with regard to leprosy. |
| Leviticus 13:59 | Rav said: The verse states: “To pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure” | Nazir 65b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>keiha</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>pronounced</b> the matter <b>unsolvable and</b> ruled it is <b>pure.</b> The Gemara further asks: <b>And perhaps</b> this means that he <b>pronounced</b> the matter <b>unsolvable and</b> ruled it is <b>impure? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The verse states: “To pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:59); <b>since the verse opened with purity first,</b> any case of uncertainty concerning leprous sores is deemed pure. |
| Leviticus 13:59 | Two exclusions are written; | Shabbat 26b:5 | The Gemara also asks: Indeed, there is amplification in the Torah, derived from the term: And the garment, which is a generalization that comes to expand upon the details that follow. <b>And say</b> that it comes <b>to include</b> the ruling that cloth that is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>in garments</b> made of materials <b>other</b> than wool or linen can become ritually impure. The Gemara answers: That is inconceivable. <b>The verse said: A garment of wool</b> or <b>linen,</b> indicating that a garment made of <b>wool</b> or <b>linen, yes,</b> it becomes ritually impure; a garment made of <b>other materials, no,</b> it does not become ritually impure. The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that <b>when</b> the verse <b>excluded,</b> it excluded specifically a garment that is <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths; <b>however,</b> a garment that is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>can become ritually impure.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Two exclusions are written;</b> once it is stated: “A garment of wool or linen” (Leviticus 13:59), and it is also stated: <b>“Whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment” (</b>Leviticus 13:47). <b>One</b> verse comes <b>to exclude</b> cloth of <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>and one</b> verse comes <b>to exclude</b> cloth of <b>three by three</b> handbreadths, to emphasize that a garment made of a material that is neither wool nor linen cannot become ritually impure at all. This corresponds to Abaye’s opinion that garments not made of wool or linen cannot become ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | which is written: “This shall be the law of the leper [ metzora ] | Arakhin 15b:9 | <b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This shall be the law of the leper [<i>metzora</i>]</b> in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest” (Leviticus 14:2)? This means that <b>this shall be the law of a defamer [<i>motzi shem ra</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 14:2 | “This | Keritot 28a:24 | The Gemara explains that Rabbi Ḥagga could have <b>said to you:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different with regard to</b> a wealthy <b>leper, as the Merciful One excluded</b> the possibility of a wealthy person bringing the offering of a poor person in the verse: <b>“This</b> shall be the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2). The emphasis of “this” teaches that a leper fulfills his obligation only with the appropriate offering. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | the law of the leper | Keritot 9b:11 | The mishna teaches that <b>a leper who was afflicted</b> with <b>several</b> instances of <b>leprosy</b> brings one single offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it is written: “This</b> shall be <b>the law of the leper</b> in the day of his purification” (Leviticus 14:2). The term “the law” teaches that <b>one law,</b> meaning one sacrificial offering, can suffice <b>for several lepers,</b> i.e., for several instances of leprosy in the same individual. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing” | Megillah 21a:2 | <b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for breaking the neck of the heifer,</b> as the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Atonement is written with regard to</b> the heifer, teaching that it is treated <b>like sacred</b> offerings, and it has already been established that all actions relating to offerings must be performed during the day. <b>And for purifying the leper,</b> it is derived <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing”</b> (Leviticus 14:2). |
| Leviticus 14:2 | a leper, about which it is written only “law,” | Menachot 19a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of the offering of <b>a leper, about which it is written only “law,”</b> as the verse states: “This shall be the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to the <b>four species that</b> are used <b>in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper,</b> i.e., cedar, hyssop, scarlet wool, and birds, failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, since it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper.”</b> Due to the added emphasis of the term “shall be,” it is <b>considered as if</b> the term <b>statute were written with regard to it.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:2 | as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper” | Menachot 27a:20 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>that are in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2), and the term “shall be” indicates an indispensable requirement. <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>of the <i>lulav</i>,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, as the verse states: <b>“And you shall take” [<i>ulkaḥtem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), which alludes to: <b>A complete taking [<i>lekiḥa tamma</i>],</b> comprising all four species. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | being, as the verse states: “This shall be the law of the leper” | Menachot 5a:14 | <b>Rav Pappa said</b> in response: <b>The <i>halakhot</i> of a leper are different, as</b> it <b>is written concerning them</b> an expression of <b>being, as the verse states: “This shall be the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2). The term <b>“shall be”</b> indicates that <b>it shall be as it is,</b> i.e., the purification process of a leper must be performed in accordance with the precise order prescribed in the Torah. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | as it is written: “This is the law of the leper” | Nedarim 36a:2 | The Gemara answers. The reference is to <b>blood of the sin-offering of a leper and blood of the guilt-offering of a leper.</b> These are offerings brought by a leper who is lacking atonement, in order to complete his purification process, <b>as it is written: “This is the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2). And the verse comes to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> of a leper apply to <b>both an adult and a minor.</b> This offering, too, does not require the knowledge of the one for whom the offering atones. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | as it is written: “This | Yoma 41b:6 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna: <b>A poor leper who brings</b> the <b>offering</b> that <b>a wealthy person</b> is required to bring <b>fulfills</b> his obligation. <b>A wealthy person who brings</b> the <b>offering</b> that <b>a poor person</b> is required to bring <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of leper, <b>as it is written: “This</b> shall be the law of the leper on the day of his purification” (Leviticus 14:2). The word “this” serves to emphasize that the details of the purification process must be carried out without any deviation. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | “The law of” | Yoma 41b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if any deviation is unacceptable, then in the case of <b>the first clause,</b> in which a poor leper brings the offering that a wealthy person is required to bring, he should <b>also</b> not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One includes</b> that case by stating: <b>“The law of”</b> (Leviticus 14:2). <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The law of”</b> was stated <b>in order to include a poor leper who brought</b> the <b>offering</b> that <b>a wealthy</b> person is required to bring. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a wealthy</b> person <b>who brought</b> the <b>offering</b> that <b>a poor person</b> is required to bring also fulfills his obligation. Therefore, <b>the verse states “this”</b> to indicate that the wealthy person may not deviate from what is required of him. |
| Leviticus 14:2 | shall be | Yoma 62b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>The reason</b> is specifically <b>because the Merciful One</b> in the Torah <b>amplified</b> and thereby indicated that the lambs are valid even if they are not identical. <b>Doesn’t this</b> indicate that if <b>the Merciful One did not amplify, I would have said</b> the lambs are <b>disqualified? From where do we</b> derive that the lambs are <b>prevented</b> from being sacrificed if they are not identical? The Gemara answers: It could <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written:</b> “This <b>shall be</b> the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2), the verse indicates that every detail stated in this context is indispensable. Therefore, it was necessary for the Torah to indicate that the lambs are valid even if they are not identical. |
| Leviticus 14:3 | and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed | Megillah 8b:18 | <b>Abaye said</b> that the <b>verse states: “And the priest shall go out of the camp,</b> and the priest shall look, <b>and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed</b> in the leper” (Leviticus 14:3), then the purification process that includes shaving and bringing birds commences. This indicates that these <i>halakhot</i> apply to a confirmed leper <b>whose leprosy is dependent on healing, to exclude that</b> leper <b>whose leprosy is not dependent</b> solely <b>on healing but rather on</b> the passage of <b>days.</b> Even if his symptoms are healed, he is pure only at the conclusion of the seven days of quarantine. |
| Leviticus 14:4 | he is to bring two birds for his purification | Arakhin 16b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Levi says: What is different</b> and notable about <b>a leper that the Torah states</b> that <b>he is to bring two birds for his purification</b> (Leviticus 14:4)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He says: He acted</b> by speaking malicious speech <b>with an act of chatter; therefore the Torah says</b> that <b>he is to bring an offering</b> of birds, who chirp and <b>chatter</b> all the time. |
| Leviticus 14:4 | two living birds [ tzipporim ] | Chullin 140a:5 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage discussing the purification ritual of a leper: “Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed <b>two living birds [<i>tzipporim</i>]</b> that are kosher” (Leviticus 14:4). Since the birds are obviously alive before the purification ritual begins, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“living”?</b> Is it <b>not that they are living in your mouth,</b> i.e., permitted for consumption? If so, <b>by inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that there are</b> birds [<i>tzipporim</i>] <b>that are not living in your mouth,</b> i.e., that are not kosher. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> that is not its meaning. Rather, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“living”?</b> It means <b>that their extremities are living,</b> i.e., attached to their bodies. The verse indicates that the kosher birds must have all their limbs attached to their bodies in order to be used in the purification ritual. |
| Leviticus 14:4 | the purification of a leper, | Chullin 62a:5 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The bird known as <b>the scratching bird is fit for</b> use in <b>the purification of a leper,</b> i.e., it is kosher. Only kosher birds are fit for this rite, as the verse states: “Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be purified two living pure birds” (Leviticus 14:4). <b>And this is the white <i>senunit</i> about which Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed</b> in the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 14:4 | “Taking [ kiḥa ]” | Chullin 82a:7 | His reasoning is that he <b>derives</b> it via verbal analogy <b>from</b> the terms: <b>“Taking [<i>kiḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), with regard to the birds, and: <b>“Taking [<i>kiḥa</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), with regard to the <b>heifer whose neck is broken.</b> Consequently, just as deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited from the time of its selection, so too must deriving benefit from these birds be prohibited from the time of their selection. Clearly, then, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds that deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited while it is still alive. Therefore, its slaughter is one that does not render the animal fit for consumption. Accordingly, Rabbi Shimon would exempt its slaughterer from the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, as is taught in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 14:4 | “And scarlet wool [ ushni tola’at ]” | Menachot 42b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says: Even a second appearance</b> caused by the dye <b>is fit,</b> meaning even if it is the second time that the dye is being used, it is still fit. <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And scarlet wool [<i>ushni tola’at</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), which is interpreted to mean that this may be the second [<i>sheni</i>] usage of the dye. |
| Leviticus 14:4 | birds” | Yoma 62b:8 | The Gemara comments: <b>And we also learned similarly with regard to</b> the birds used for the purification of <b>a leper.</b> The verse states that the priest should take “two <b>birds”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), and the <b>minimum</b> number indicated by the plural term <b>birds</b> is <b>two. What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: Two?</b> It indicates <b>that the two</b> birds <b>should be identical. And from where</b> do we derive <b>that even if they are not identical</b> they are <b>valid? The verses state: Bird, bird</b> (Leviticus 14:5–6), repetitively, to <b>amplify.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:5 | a leper | Sotah 15b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>taught:</b> It must be <b>a new earthenware vessel;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yishmael <b>derives</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“vessel”</b> in the case of the <i>sota</i> (Numbers 5:17) and <b>“vessel” from</b> the case of <b>a leper</b> (Leviticus 14:5). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the leper, <b>a new earthenware</b> vessel is required, <b>so too here,</b> a <b>new earthenware</b> vessel is required. |
| Leviticus 14:5 | As it is written: “And he shall slaughter one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water” | Sotah 15b:5 | <b>And there,</b> with regard to the leper, <b>from where do we</b> derive that a new vessel is required? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And he shall slaughter one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water”</b> (Leviticus 14:5). <b>Just as running water has not been used</b> beforehand <b>for work,</b> i.e., once used it is no longer considered to be running, <b>so too</b> the <b>vessel</b> must <b>not have been used for work.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:7 | into the open field” | Kiddushin 57b:3 | The Gemara offers another answer to the question of how the <i>baraita</i> knew which bird the verse is permitting. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The verse states: “And shall let go</b> the living bird <b>into the open field”</b> (Leviticus 14:7), which indicates that the bird is <b>like a field: Just as a field is permitted, so too, this</b> bird <b>is also permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: Is <b>that</b> word <b>“field” coming to</b> teach <b>this? That</b> word <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b>“field”</b> teaches <b>that one may not stand in Jaffa and throw</b> the bird that is set free <b>to the sea,</b> or stand <b>in Gevat and throw it to the desert, and that he may not stand outside the city and throw it inside the city. Rather, any</b> manner in <b>which he is standing in the city and throws it outside the wall</b> to the field is valid. The word “field” teaches that one must set it free only to the field and nowhere else, not to teach that the bird is permitted. |
| Leviticus 14:8 | marital relations, as it is written: “But he shall dwell outside his tent seven days” | Chullin 141a:15 | The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this leper, since as long as he is not purified he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations, as it is written: “But he shall dwell outside his tent seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8), and when the verse states: <b>“His tent,” this</b> is referring to <b>his wife,</b> such that one may derive <b>from here that</b> a leper <b>is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations,</b> perhaps his purification ceremony should take precedence. This is because <b>perhaps you</b> will <b>say: Since he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations, let his positive mitzva</b> of purification <b>come and override the positive mitzva of the sending</b> away <b>of</b> the mother bird from <b>the nest.</b> Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” <b>teaches us</b> that even so, one may not take the mother bird. |
| Leviticus 14:8 | sexual intercourse, as it is stated: “And he shall dwell outside his tent for seven days” | Keritot 8b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If so, why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “A leprous <b>man”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse removed it from the matter</b> stated <b>earlier,</b> and applied it <b>to the matter</b> stated <b>later:</b> “His garments shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go wild,” <b>to say</b> that <b>a man</b> who is a leper <b>lets his hair grow wild and rends his garments, but the woman</b> who is a leper <b>does not</b> need to <b>let her hair grow wild and</b> does not <b>rend her garments. And</b> a female leper <b>is permitted to</b> engage in <b>sexual intercourse, as it is stated: “And he shall dwell outside his tent for seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8), <b>and not: Outside her tent.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:8 | “But he shall remain outside his tent | Moed Katan15b:13 | The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>sexual relations? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning a leper states: <b>“But he shall remain outside his tent</b> seven days” (Leviticus 14:8), from which it is derived <b>that</b> a leper <b>should be like one who is ostracized and like a mourner, and he is prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in sexual relations.</b> How is this derived? The <b>only</b> meaning of the term <b>“his tent”</b> is <b>his wife, as is stated</b> after the giving of the Torah: <b>“Go say to them, return again to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27). This statement rendered it permitted for the men to once again engage in sexual relations with their wives after they had previously been prohibited to do so in anticipation of the giving of the Torah, as expressed in the verse: “Come not near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that it is prohibited for a leper to engage in sexual relations. |
| Leviticus 14:8 | “But he shall remain outside his tent seven days” | Moed Katan7b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that a confirmed</b> leper <b>is permitted</b> to engage <b>in conjugal relations</b> with his wife? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and so</b> too <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a leper who is counting his seven days, it is written: <b>“But he shall remain outside his tent seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8). This verse teaches <b>that</b> the leper <b>is prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in conjugal relations,</b> as the words <b>his tent</b> refer <b>only</b> to <b>his wife, as it is stated: “Go, say to them: Return again to your tents” (</b>Deuteronomy 5:27). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse states: “And after he is cleansed, <b>they shall count for him seven days”</b> (Ezekiel 44:26), indicating that he is prohibited from having conjugal relations during <b>the days of his counting, but not</b> during <b>the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | “And he shall bathe his flesh [ et besaro ] in water” | Bava Kamma82a:15 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, concerning a verse that discusses one who must undergo ritual immersion: <b>“And he shall bathe his flesh [<i>et besaro</i>] in water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). This verse teaches <b>that no substance should interpose between his flesh and the water.</b> When the verse states this in the expanded form of <b>“<i>et</i> his flesh,”</b> using the term “<i>et</i>,” this teaches that the water must come into contact even with <b>that which is subordinate to his flesh. And what is that?</b> It is one’s <b>hair.</b> Accordingly, the Torah itself states that there may not be any interposing substance in the hair at the time of immersion. What, then, did Ezra add? |
| Leviticus 14:9 | “And he shall bathe his flesh in water” | Chagigah 11a:12 | § The mishna further taught that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity</b> have something to support them. The Gemara again asks: But ritual purity <b>is written</b> explicitly in the Torah. The Gemara answers: The observation that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity merely have something to support them <b>is necessary only for</b> the minimum <b>measure of a ritual bath, which is not written</b> explicitly in the Torah. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall bathe his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). This means <b>in the water of a ritual bath.</b> And it is stated: “And he shall wash <b>all his flesh</b> in water” (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that it must contain <b>water in which his whole body can enter. And how much</b> water <b>is this? One cubit by one cubit with a height of three cubits. And the Sages estimated</b> that the measure for <b>ritual bath water</b> is <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:9 | As it is taught | Nazir 40b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the Rabbis;</b> how do they derive from this <i>halakha</i> that a leper must shave with a razor? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the shaving of a leper: “He shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard” (Leviticus 14:9). Since the verse states: “All his hair,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “His beard”?</b> It is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the same</b> should <b>also</b> apply to <b>a leper,</b> i.e. that a leper who was a priest should be prohibited from shaving his beard. For this reason <b>the verse states: “His beard,”</b> which emphasizes that despite the general prohibition barring a priest from shaving his beard, a priest who is a leper is obligated to do so. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | his head | Nazir 41a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, what is</b> his <b>reason?</b> From where does he derive the <i>halakha</i> that a leper must use a razor? He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the fact that the verse states with regard to a leper: “He shall shave all his hair off <b>his head</b> and his beard” (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why does the verse state: “His head,”</b> if it already stated: “All his hair”? It is <b>because it is stated with regard to a nazirite: “No razor shall come upon his head”</b> (Numbers 6:5), and therefore one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the same</b> should <b>also</b> apply to <b>a nazirite</b> who is <b>a leper,</b> i.e., it should be prohibited for him to shave his head even for the purification ritual for his leprosy. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His head,”</b> to teach that a nazirite who is a leper must shave his head with a razor. Being that a nazirite is prohibited only to use a razor, if a leper could fulfill his obligation to remove his hair using other implements, a nazirite who is a leper would not be permitted to use a razor. Therefore, it can be inferred from the <i>halakha</i> of a nazirite who is a leper that the only way for a leper to remove his hair is with a razor. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | “his beard” | Nazir 41a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write: “His head”? And let one derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> that the mitzva of shaving overrides that prohibition <b>from</b> the term <b>“his beard”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why does the verse state: “His beard”?</b> It is <b>because</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), and therefore one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the same</b> prohibition against shaving one’s beard should <b>also</b> apply to <b>a leper.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His beard.”</b> |
| Leviticus 14:9 | his head” | Nazir 44a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let shaving not be exempted from its general prohibition</b> in the case of a leper, due to <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the prohibition of <b>wine: And if wine, which does not negate</b> naziriteship, <b>is not exempted from its general prohibition;</b> then, with regard to <b>shaving, which does negate</b> naziriteship, <b>is it not logical that it should not be exempted from its general prohibition?</b> The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to a leper: “That he shall shave all his hair,” and adds: “Off <b>his head”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). <b>And the Merciful One</b> further <b>states:</b> “And <b>his beard,”</b> which teaches that he shaves despite the prohibition of naziriteship. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | his head | Nazir 57b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue of whether one who <b>rounds the entire head</b> is considered to have rounded its corners <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a verse that deals with the shaving of a leper: “He shall shave all his hair; <b>his head</b> and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off” (Leviticus 14:9). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “His head,” after it has already stated: “All his hair”? The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>since it is stated: “You shall not round the corners of your heads”</b> (Leviticus 19:27), |
| Leviticus 14:9 | his beard” | Nazir 58a:10 | The Gemara continues this line of inquiry: <b>And</b> according to <b>this <i>tanna</i>, who derives from</b> the term <b>“his head”</b> that a positive mitzva overrides <b>only a prohibition, from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of a leper’s shaving <b>comes and overrides</b> the <b>prohibition and the positive mitzva</b> of a nazirite? From where does this <b>tanna</b> learn that a nazirite who contracted leprosy is obligated to shave? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: “He shall shave all his hair; his head and <b>his beard”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). |
| Leviticus 14:9 | rounding the entire head is called rounding. | Nazir 58a:5 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts its previous explanation and states the opposite. It is <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>rounding the entire head is called rounding.</b> If so, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the verse: “He shall shave all his hair; his head” (Leviticus 14:9), comes to permit the rounding of a leper’s entire head is easily understood, as it is derived from here that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition. <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who establishes the verse</b> “He shall shave all his hair; his head” as coming <b>to override</b> the <b>prohibition and</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of a nazirite, <b>from where does he</b> derive that a positive mitzva overrides <b>only a prohibition?</b> |
| Leviticus 14:9 | his head | Nazir 58b:3 | The Gemara turns its attention to the other opinion: <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who establishes this</b> verse: “He shall shave all his hair; <b>his head</b> and his beard” (Leviticus 14:9), as referring <b>to a nazirite,</b> i.e., he derives from this verse the principle that in certain cases, including that of a leprous priest, a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition and a positive mitzva, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“his beard”?</b> |
| Leviticus 14:9 | “And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all his hair” | Sotah 16a:8 | The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yishmael <b>taught</b> some cases <b>and omitted</b> others; his list is not exhaustive. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>did he omit that he omitted this?</b> It is not reasonable that he would provide a list lacking only one item. The Gemara answers: <b>He omitted the leper, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 1:9): In the verse: <b>“And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all his hair”</b> (Leviticus 14:9), the phrase “all his hair” is <b>a generalization.</b> The phrase that follows: <b>“His head and his beard and his eyebrows,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> And with the following phrase: <b>“Even all his hair he shall shave off,”</b> the verse <b>then generalized</b> again. In any case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail is explicitly</b> referring to <b>areas</b> where there is <b>a collection of hair which is visible, so too all areas</b> on the leper that have <b>a collection of hair which is visible</b> must be shaven. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | in the Torah, as it is written: “And he shall bathe his flesh in the water” | Sukkah 6a:9 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said earlier that Rav said that the <i>halakhot</i> governing <b>interpositions</b> that invalidate ritual immersion are <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>These,</b> too, <b>are</b> written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “And he shall bathe his flesh in the water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9), and the Sages derived <b>that nothing should interpose between his flesh and the water.</b> Apparently, the <i>halakhot</i> of interposition are derived from a verse in the Torah and not through oral tradition. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | his head | Yevamot 5a:2 | The Gemara responds: <b>They derive it from</b> the verse mentioned with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the purification of a leper from his leprosy [<i>tzara’at</i>]: “And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off <b>his head</b> and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off” (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Since it states “all his hair,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “his head”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>as it is stated: “You shall not round the corners of your heads”</b> (Leviticus 19:27), i.e., it is prohibited to shave the corners of the head, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a leper is</b> included in this prohibition. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | “His beard” | Yevamot 5a:5 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara provides an alternative suggestion: The principle that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition <b>is derived from</b> the superfluous phrase: <b>“His beard”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “His beard”?</b> After all, a beard is already included in the phrase: “All his hair.” The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a leper who is a priest is included</b> in this prohibition against shaving his beard. Therefore, <b>the verse states “his beard”</b> in the case of a leper. |
| Leviticus 14:9 | by this tanna . As it is taught | Yevamot 5a:8 | § <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this line of reasoning in favor of an alternative answer. The principle that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition <b>is derived</b> from a different interpretation of the phrase <b>“his head,”</b> cited <b>by this <i>tanna</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “He shall shave all his hair off his head” (Leviticus 14:9); <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “His head”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“No razor shall come upon his head”</b> (Numbers 6:5), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a leper who is a nazirite</b> is prohibited from shaving his head upon purification. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His head.”</b> This teaches that the positive mitzva for a leper to shave overrides the prohibition of a nazirite. |
| Leviticus 14:10 | and three-tenths of fine flour for a meal offering, | Menachot 91a:25 | § The mishna teaches that in general sin offerings and guilt offerings do not require libations. <b>But</b> the exception is <b>that the sin offering of a leper and his guilt offering require libations.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the following verse, which details the offerings a leper is required to bring as part of his purification process: “And on the eighth day he shall take two unblemished male lambs, and one unblemished female lamb in its year, <b>and three-tenths of fine flour for a meal offering,</b> mixed with oil, and one <i>log</i> of oil” (Leviticus 14:10). The <i>baraita</i> explains: It is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering</b> that <b>the verse speaks,</b> and so it is stating that each of the three offerings mentioned requires libations. |
| Leviticus 14:10 | written, | Shabbat 132a:14 | <b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: But if</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> then, with regard to <b>those lacking atonement,</b> such as a <i>zav</i> or a healed leper, who must after their immersion still bring an atonement offering in order to complete their purification process, <b>with regard to whom</b> the term <b>on the day is</b> also <b>written,</b> as in the verse: “And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish” (Leviticus 14:10), sacrificing their atonement offerings <b>should also override Shabbat.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan responded: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to teach that the sacrifice must be brought <b>during the day and not at night.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:10 | “He shall take two lambs” | Yoma 62b:5 | The Gemara comments that <b>this was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>lambs</b> brought by a <b>leper,</b> based upon the verse: <b>“He shall take two lambs”</b> (Leviticus 14:10). The <b>minimum</b> number of <b>lambs,</b> which is a plural term, is <b>two.</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “two”?</b> It teaches <b>that the two should be identical.</b> And <b>from where</b> do we derive <b>that even if the two</b> lambs <b>are not identical</b> they are nevertheless <b>valid? The verses state: Lamb, lamb,</b> repetitively, <b>to amplify</b> and indicate that the lambs are valid even if they are not identical. |
| Leviticus 14:11 | as it is written: “And the priest that cleans | Sotah 8a:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Because there,</b> at the Eastern Gate, <b>they give the <i>sota</i> women</b> the bitter water <b>to drink,</b> and there the lepers and women who have given birth are purified. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the <i>sota</i> women</b> are given the bitter water to drink there, <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall stand the woman before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 5:18), and the Eastern Gate is directly opposite the Sanctuary, which is the area referred to as “before the Lord.” Similarly, with regard to <b>lepers as well,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And the priest that cleans</b> him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:11). <b>But what is the reason that</b> a woman <b>who has given birth</b> must also be purified there? |
| Leviticus 14:12 | and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering | Menachot 61a:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that both the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies the guilt offering of a recovered leper and the guilt offering itself require waving. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs <b>and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12). The plural form “them” <b>teaches that</b> the <i>log</i> of oil and the offering <b>require waving,</b> and that this should be performed with both of them <b>together.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:12 | leper and his guilt offering | Menachot 61a:5 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> are the items that <b>require waving and do not require bringing near</b> to the altar: <b>The <i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper and his guilt offering</b> itself, as it is written: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12); <b>and the first fruits, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov; and the sacrificial portions of the peace offerings of an individual and their breast and thigh,</b> as it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the portions consumed by fire, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15). |
| Leviticus 14:12 | he begins from the place where he stopped, here he has no remedy. | Yoma 61b:2 | <b>And</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, who say</b> that <b>he begins from the place where he stopped, here he has no remedy.</b> According to their opinion, a service that has not been completed properly remains valid. In this case, once he has slaughtered the animal he cannot bring a second guilt-offering, as the verse states: “And offer it for a guilt-offering” (Leviticus 14:12), and not two guilt-offerings. |
| Leviticus 14:12 | it | Yoma 61b:3 | <b>Rav Ḥisda strongly objects to this: But isn’t it written:</b> “And offer <b>it</b> for a guilt-offering” (Leviticus 14:12), which indicates that he must offer that same guilt-offering he waved earlier, and if he does not do so the rite is invalid? If so, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, he cannot use another offering. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <b>difficult</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan. |
| Leviticus 14:12 | before the Lord” | Zevachim 119b:15 | The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>waving</b> of those offerings that require waving is <b>as it is written: “And the priest</b> shall take one of the lambs, and offer it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and <b>wave</b> them for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 14:12). The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>bringing</b> meal offerings to the corner of the altar before the removal of the handful is <b>as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8). The definite article before the word “altar” indicates that this applies only to the altar in the Tabernacle, and not on a private altar. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | the guilt offering of the leper, it is explicitly written with regard to it: “For as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt offering” | Menachot 73a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the verse. The Torah states: <b>“And every guilt offering of theirs,” to include the guilt offering of the nazirite</b> who has become ritually impure (see Numbers 6:12) <b>and the guilt offering of the leper,</b> teaching that they are also eaten by the priests. The Gemara objects: With regard to <b>the guilt offering of the leper, it is explicitly written with regard to it: “For as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13), which already teaches that it is eaten by the priests. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | “And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt-offering” | Yevamot 7a:14 | <b>How so?</b> The <i>baraita</i> provides an example of this principle. With regard to the guilt-offering of a leper, the verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “As the sin-offering</b>…<b>so is the guilt-offering,”</b> since apparently this comparison does not teach anything new because the <i>halakhot</i> of guilt-offerings are already stated elsewhere (Leviticus 7:1–10), then <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “As the sin-offering</b>…<b>so is the guilt-offering”?</b> |
| Leviticus 14:13 | the verse states: “For as the sin-offering is, so is the guilt-offering” | Yoma 61b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to the blood of the leper’s guilt-offering that he presents <b>on the altar,</b> like the blood of other guilt-offerings, it is <b>so</b> that he collects the blood in his hand rather than with a vessel. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For as the sin-offering is, so is the guilt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13): <b>Just as a sin-offering requires a vessel</b> for collection of its blood, <b>so too,</b> the blood of <b>a guilt-offering requires</b> collection in <b>a vessel. And you find that you</b> must <b>say: The leper’s guilt-offering</b> requires <b>two priests</b> to <b>collect its blood; one</b> collects <b>by hand, and</b> the other <b>one</b> collects <b>in a vessel. The one who collected in a vessel comes to the altar</b> and sprinkles some of the blood on it, <b>and the one who collected by hand comes to the leper</b> and sprinkles some of the blood on him. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | It is explicitly written with regard to the guilt offering of a leper | Zevachim 44b:9 | The Gemara challenges: <b>It is explicitly written with regard to the guilt offering of a leper</b> that it is consumed by the priests: “For as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt offering” (Leviticus 14:13). Why, then, is this derivation necessary? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means to say that the phrase: “Every guilt offering of theirs,” serves <b>to include the guilt offering of a nazirite,</b> teaching that it is <b>like the guilt offering of a leper,</b> in that both are eaten by the priests. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | the verse states: “For as the sin offering is, so is the guilt offering” | Zevachim 47b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to the blood of the leper’s guilt offering that he presents <b>on the altar,</b> like the blood of other guilt offerings, it is <b>so,</b> that he collects the blood in his hand rather than with a vessel. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “For as the sin offering is, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13). This teaches that <b>just as a sin offering requires a vessel</b> for collection of its blood, <b>so too,</b> the blood of <b>a guilt offering requires a vessel</b> for collection of its blood. <b>You consequently say:</b> In the case of <b>a leper’s guilt offering, two priests collect its blood; one</b> collects the blood <b>by hand, and</b> the other <b>one</b> collects the blood <b>in a vessel. This</b> one, <b>who collected</b> the blood <b>in a vessel, comes to the altar</b> and sprinkles some of the blood on it. <b>And that</b> one, <b>who collected</b> the blood <b>by hand, comes to</b> the <b>leper</b> and places some of the blood on his right ear, right thumb, and right big toe. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | “And he shall slaughter the sheep | Zevachim 49a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> a verse teaching that in order <b>to</b> perform the <b>mitzva</b> in the optimal manner, the slaughtering of the guilt offering is in the north. <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>to disqualify</b> after the fact an offering slaughtered elsewhere, not in the north? The Gemara answers: <b>Another verse is written,</b> referring to a guilt offering, which states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the sheep</b> in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; to the priest, it is most holy” (Leviticus 14:13). This teaches that all guilt offerings are disqualified if they are not slaughtered in the north. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | “And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; | Zevachim 49a:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>How so?</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin offering, so is the guilt offering;</b> to the priest, it is most holy” (Leviticus 14:13). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “As the sin offering, so is the guilt offering,”</b> since the verse had already equated the guilt offering with the sin offering, <b>why</b> does the <b>verse state: “As the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”?</b> What does it serve to teach? |
| Leviticus 14:13 | sacrificial portions, which require priesthood, | Zevachim 49b:3 | <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: Say</b> that <b>when the verse returned</b> the guilt offering of a leper to the class of standard guilt offerings, that is only <b>with regard to place-ment of blood</b> on the altar <b>and</b> burning the <b>sacrificial portions, which require priesthood,</b> i.e., only a priest may perform those rites. As the verse states: “For as the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; to the priest” (Leviticus 14:13). <b>But</b> say that <b>slaughter, which does not require priesthood,</b> as even a non-priest may slaughter an offering, <b>does not require</b> that it be done in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 14:13 | to a burnt offering | Zevachim 49b:5 | § The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>to juxtapose</b> the guilt offering of a leper <b>to a sin offering</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that it must be slaughtered in the north, and <b>why do I</b> need <b>to juxtapose</b> it <b>to a burnt offering</b> to teach the same <i>halakha</i>? The verse states: “And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 14:13). |
| Leviticus 14:14 | ear | Kiddushin 15a:1 | <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, would say: <b>That</b> term, “his ear,” <b>comes for a verbal analogy. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived that the <b>piercing</b> of a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl is performed <b>on the right ear? It is stated: Ear, here,</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave, <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the ritual purification of a leper: “The right <b>ear</b> of he who is to be purified” (Leviticus 14:14). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a leper, it specifies the <b>right</b> ear explicitly, <b>so too here,</b> the piercing of a slave must be performed on the <b>right</b> ear. |
| Leviticus 14:14 | does not have a thumb or big toe, | Nazir 46b:5 | To <b>what</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is Rabbi Pedat referring? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A leper who <b>does not have a thumb or big toe,</b> upon both of which he must place the blood and oil of his purification ritual (Leviticus 14:14) can <b>never</b> attain <b>ritual purity.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The priest <b>puts it on the spot</b> of the missing thumb, <b>and</b> the leper thereby <b>fulfills</b> his obligation. <b>The Rabbis say: Let him put it on the left</b> thumb <b>and</b> thereby <b>fulfill</b> his obligation. According to Rabbi Pedat, Rabbi Eliezer and Beit Shammai both maintain that if the ritual cannot be performed in the precise manner delineated, one cannot fulfill his obligation and has no remedy. This is one version of the discussion. |
| Leviticus 14:14 | it is the right | Yevamot 104a:11 | It was taught in the mishna that if <i>ḥalitza</i> was performed <b>using</b> his <b>left foot, her <i>ḥalitza</i></b> is invalid, while Rabbi Elazar validates it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the Rabbis’</b> opinion? <b>Ulla said: We derive</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“foot”</b> stated here, and the word <b>“foot” stated regarding the leper. Just as there,</b> with respect to the leper, <b>it is the right</b> foot (Leviticus 14:14), <b>so too here,</b> with respect to <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>it is the right</b> foot that must be used. |
| Leviticus 14:14 | shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering, | Yoma 61b:7 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> “And the priest <b>shall take of the blood of the guilt-offering,</b> and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:14). One <b>might</b> have thought that he should take it <b>in a vessel;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And put.” Just as putting</b> means <b>with the priest’s own</b> body, <b>so too, taking</b> means <b>with the priest’s own</b> body. |
| Leviticus 14:14 | shall take | Zevachim 47b:5 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 9:2): The Torah states with regard to the guilt offering of a leper: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take</b> of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:14). One <b>might</b> have thought that he should take it <b>in a vessel;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall put.” Just as putting</b> the blood on the ear, thumb, and big toe must be performed <b>with the priest’s own</b> body, <b>so too, taking</b> of the blood is performed <b>with the priest’s own</b> body, not with a service vessel. |
| Leviticus 14:15 | “And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand” | Menachot 9b:17 | § The mishna teaches: If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is unfit. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And the meal offering was presented; and he filled his hand from it”</b> (Leviticus 9:17). Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>This hand, I do not know what it is,</b> i.e., the left hand or the right. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the atonement of a leper: <b>“And the priest shall take of the <i>log</i> of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand”</b> (Leviticus 14:15), it mentions the left hand. One can therefore derive that <b>here,</b> where the verse specifies, the priest must use his <b>left</b> hand, whereas in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in a verse <b>“hand”</b> without specification, it is referring <b>only</b> to the <b>right</b> hand. |
| Leviticus 14:16 | is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger” | Menachot 10a:12 | The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both a finger and</b> the <b>priesthood</b> to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16). This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> there is the verse that addresses <b>the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>in which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (6a): If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:16 | of the leper, | Menachot 27b:3 | <b>But</b> with regard to the sprinkling of the blood <b>that</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, of inner sin offerings, the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, the blood of the bull of the anointed priest, the blood of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and the blood of the goats of idol worship, which are to be sprinkled “before the Lord, in front of the Curtain of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and</b> the sprinkling of the oil <b>that</b> takes place during the purification <b>of the leper,</b> which is done “seven times before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), if these are performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>they are not valid.</b> But if they are performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the direction where they should be sprinkled, <b>they are valid.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:16 | there are its placements, | Menachot 74b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <b><i>log</i> of oil of a leper</b> that he brings on the day that he becomes ritually clean, which is given completely to the priests? The Gemara answers: It is not given completely to the priests, as <b>there are its placements,</b> when oil is sprinkled seven times “before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), and applied to the leper’s right ear, thumb, and big toe (see Leviticus 14:17). |
| Leviticus 14:16 | right | Menachot 83a:13 | The Gemara asks: Why must the <i>baraita</i> teach that the <i>halakha</i> of the sin offering teaches that the rites of offerings must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand?</b> Isn’t this <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana? As Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In <b>any place</b> in the Torah <b>that it is stated</b> that an action is performed with <b>a finger, or</b> that it is performed by <b>priesthood,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the rite is performed <b>only</b> with the <b>right</b> hand. This is derived from the Torah’s statement with regard to the leper: “And the priest shall dip his right finger” (Leviticus 14:16). The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>cited</b> the principle from the model of a sin offering <b>for no reason,</b> since it is actually derived from Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s statement. |
| Leviticus 14:16 | is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger” | Zevachim 24b:5 | The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both</b> a finger and the priesthood to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16).

| Leviticus 14:16 | placements of its | Zevachim 44a:19 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling, that even the <i>log</i> of oil of a leper is included in the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who</b> agrees with the Rabbis that the libations of an animal offering are not permitted by the blood of the offering. And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> with regard to the <b><i>log</i> of oil of a leper</b> that it is not the blood of the guilt offering that renders it permitted; rather, the <b>placements of its</b> oil “before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16) <b>render</b> the remainder of the oil <b>permitted</b> to be eaten by the priests. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>placements of its</b> oil <b>render</b> the oil <b>permitted,</b> by the same token the <b>placements of its</b> oil <b>render it <i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., if the oil was placed with the intent that the priests should consume its remainder on the following day, one who consumes the oil is liable for consuming <i>piggul</i>. |
| Leviticus 14:16 | right | Zevachim 98a:10 | The Gemara asks: Why must the <i>baraita</i> teach that <i>halakha</i> of the sin offering teaches that the rites of an offering must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand?</b> Is this not <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana?

The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>cited</b> the principle from the model of a sin offering <b>for no reason,</b> since it is actually derived from Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s statement. |
| Leviticus 14:17 | written: “Upon the blood of the guilt offering” | Menachot 10a:1 | After all, a verse already indicates that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe, <b>as</b> it is <b>written: “Upon the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:17). Since the Torah has already specified that the blood is placed upon the right thumb and big toe (Leviticus 14:14), it is clear that the oil is placed there as well. Similarly, why must the verse specify with regard to a poor leper that the oil is placed on the right thumb and big toe? Isn’t already clear from the verse where the oil must be placed, as it states: “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering” (Leviticus 14:28)? The Gemara responds: <b>One</b> specification, stated with regard to a wealthy leper, serves <b>to permit</b> the placement of the oil on the <b>sides</b> of the thumb and sides of the big toe in addition to the nail side of the thumb and big toe, <b>and one,</b> stated with regard to a poor leper, serves <b>to disqualify the sides of sides,</b> i.e., their undersides. |
| Leviticus 14:17 | “Upon the blood of the guilt offering” | Menachot 10a:2 | The Gemara inquires with regard to the verse: <b>“Upon the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), stated with regard to the purification of a wealthy leper, and the verse: <b>“Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:28), stated with regard to the purification of a poor leper. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>do they come,</b> i.e., why are both verses necessary? |
| Leviticus 14:17 | “Upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” | Menachot 9b:21 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> According to your opinion, one interprets homiletically the additional specifications in the passage discussing the purification of a leper. If so, there is another apparently superfluous verse: <b>“Upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), <b>which is written with regard to</b> the placement of the <b>oil</b> upon the right thumb and big toe <b>of a wealthy leper. Why do I</b> need the verse to specify that the oil is placed on the leper’s right thumb and big toe? |
| Leviticus 14:17 | “And of the rest | Yoma 61a:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> with regard to the leper’s <i>log</i> of oil, <b>as it is written</b> earlier: <b>“And of the rest</b> of the oil that is in his hand, the priest shall put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), and it is also written: <b>“And of the rest</b> of the oil that is in the priest’s hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified” (Leviticus 14:18). This shows that the presentation on the head is performed only with the remainder of the oil, and therefore this action is certainly not indispensable. |
| Leviticus 14:18 | “And of the rest | Yoma 61a:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> with regard to the leper’s <i>log</i> of oil, <b>as it is written</b> earlier: <b>“And of the rest</b> of the oil that is in his hand, the priest shall put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), and it is also written: <b>“And of the rest</b> of the oil that is in the priest’s hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified” (Leviticus 14:18). This shows that the presentation on the head is performed only with the remainder of the oil, and therefore this action is certainly not indispensable. |
| Leviticus 14:18 | to make atonement for him before the Lord” | Zevachim 6b:2 | <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna with regard to the purification process of a leper (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:10): The verse states: <b>“And the rest of the oil that is in</b> the priest’s <b>hand</b> he shall put upon the head of the one that is to be purified, <b>to make atonement for him before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 14:18). This teaches that <b>if</b> the priest <b>placed</b> the oil on the leper’s head, <b>it atoned</b> for him, and he is purified, <b>but if he did not place</b> the oil on his head, <b>it did not atone</b> for him; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> Placement of the oil on the leper’s head <b>is a non-essential mitzva.</b> Therefore, <b>whether</b> the oil <b>was placed</b> on his head or <b>whether it was not placed</b> on his head, <b>it atoned</b> for him, <b>but</b> the verse <b>ascribes</b> the leper blame <b>as though it did not atone</b> for him. |
| Leviticus 14:19 | the sin offering of a leper; as it is written: “And the priest shall offer [ ve’asa ] the sin offering” | Zevachim 8a:13 | <b>Rather, Rava says:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the sin offering of a leper; as it is written: “And the priest shall offer [<i>ve’asa</i>] the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:19), teaching <b>that all</b> sacrificial <b>actions of [<i>asiyyotav</i>]</b> a sin offering <b>must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:19 | The verse states: “And make atonement for the one that is to be purified | Zevachim 8a:14 | <b>And we found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a sin offering must be sacrificed without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering,</b> and that this is indispensable. <b>From where do we</b> derive that sacrificing a sin offering without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner</b> is also indispensable? <b>The verse states: “And make atonement for the one that is to be purified</b> of his impurity” (Leviticus 14:19), indicating that the sin offering must be sacrificed <b>for</b> the sake of <b>this</b> person <b>who is being purified, and not for another</b> person <b>who is to be purified.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:20 | “And the priest shall sacrifice the burnt offering and the meal offering” | Menachot 91a:26 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering</b> that the verse speaks? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to a meal offering that comes by itself. When</b> the verse <b>states,</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice the burnt offering and the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:20), which demonstrates that the meal offering accompanies the burnt offering, <b>you must say</b> that in the earlier verse as well it is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering that the verse speaks.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:20 | “And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering” | Pesachim 59b:1 | <b>“And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:20); this is interpreted as referring to the burnt-offering <b>that has already been offered.</b> From here it is derived that the leper achieves atonement even if the standard order is reversed and the burnt-offering is brought before the sin-offering. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | the Merciful One states: “And if he is poor, | Arakhin 17a:16 | § The mishna teaches: <b>But with regard to offerings that is not so, as</b> in the case of one <b>who</b> vowed and <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to provide <b>the offering of this leper,</b> if the one undergoing purification <b>was a destitute leper,</b> the one who vowed <b>brings the offering of a destitute</b> leper. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> it was <b>a wealthy person who takes the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for him?</b> But <b>the Merciful One states: “And if he is poor,</b> and his means do not suffice, then he shall take one sheep” (Leviticus 14:21). This indicates that the specified offering is only for the poor, <b>and</b> in this instance the one taking the vow <b>is not poor.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:21 | “And if he is poor” | Arakhin 17b:10 | The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse similarly states with regard to a destitute leper: <b>“And if he is poor”</b> (Leviticus 14:21), <b>so too,</b> Rabbi Yehuda should maintain that he is considered poor <b>only if he is in his</b> state of <b>poverty from his beginning until his end</b> of bringing the leper’s offering, but if he was wealthy in between he should be obligated to bring the offering of a wealthy individual, even if he is now poor. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | the verse states: “And if he is poor and cannot afford” | Keritot 28a:26 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive</b> a principle <b>from that</b> verse that with regard to any sliding-scale offering, a wealthy person who brings a poor person’s offering has not fulfilled his obligation? The Gemara answers: With regard to a leper <b>the verse states: “And if he is poor and cannot afford”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The emphasis of “he” teaches that <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a leper that a wealthy person who brought a poor person’s offering</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure, <b>a wealthy person who brought a poor person’s offering</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | for a meal offering, and a log of oil” | Menachot 106b:6 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (88a): Each tenth of an ephah of flour requires one <i>log</i> of oil. Accordingly, <b>even</b> if one brings <b>a meal offering of sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>one adds to it sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its volume, <b>even a meal offering of sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offering brought by a poor leper on the day of his purification: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle that pertains to all meal offerings, that each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | for a meal offering, and a log of oil” | Menachot 88a:18 | Each tenth of an ephah of flour requires one <i>log</i> of oil. Accordingly, <b>even</b> if one brings <b>a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>one adds to it sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its volume, <b>even a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offering brought by a poor leper on the day of his purification: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle for all meal offerings: Each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | and a log | Menachot 89a:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a poor leper,</b> who cannot afford the standard offerings that are required as part of the purification process and is instead required to bring one lamb as a guilt offering and a tenth of an ephah of flour as a meal offering, <b>it is written:</b> “And <b>a tenth</b>-<b>part</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil for a meal offering, <b>and a <i>log</i></b> of oil” (Leviticus 14:21). The verse juxtaposes the need for a <i>log</i> of oil with the fact the offering is made of a tenth of an ephah of flour. Accordingly, it <b>teaches about</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>that it requires</b> one <b><i>log</i> of oil;</b> this is <b>the statement of the Rabbis.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:21 | to be waved to effect atonement | Menachot 93b:8 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to waving in this way:</b> “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering <b>to be waved to effect atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 14:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Does waving</b> the offering <b>effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of <b>the blood? As it is stated: “For it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated waving</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>effects atonement</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | “If he be poor” | Yoma 41b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> for the parallel case of a sliding-scale offering <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the offering of leper. Consequently, in the case of a sliding-scale offering, if a wealthy person brings the offering that a poor person is required to bring, he does fulfill his obligation, contrary to Rabbi Ḥaga’s opinion. The Gemara answers: With regard to a sliding-scale offering, <b>the Merciful One excludes</b> the validity of such an offering by stating: <b>“If he be poor”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The word “he” serves to emphasize that the offering required for a poor person is valid only for him. |
| Leviticus 14:21 | to be waved to make atonement | Yoma 5a:5 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings <b>throughout the generations,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that failure to wave the offering <b>does not invalidate</b> the offering? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse says: “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt-offering <b>to be waved to make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 14:21). <b>Does waving</b> the offering <b>atone</b> for one’s sins? <b>Isn’t atonement</b> accomplished <b>only by</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11)? <b>And</b> for <b>what</b> purpose, then, <b>does the verse state: To be waved to make atonement?</b> It teaches that if <b>one deemed</b> the ritual of <b>waving</b> to be <b>a peripheral aspect of the mitzva</b> and therefore failed to perform it, <b>the verse ascribes to him</b> status <b>as though he did not achieve</b> optimal <b>atonement; and</b> nevertheless, the offering <b>atones</b> for his sins on his behalf. |
| Leviticus 14:28 | “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering” | Menachot 10a:2 | The Gemara inquires with regard to the verse: <b>“Upon the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), stated with regard to the purification of a wealthy leper, and the verse: <b>“Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:28), stated with regard to the purification of a poor leper. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>do they come,</b> i.e., why are both verses necessary? |
| Leviticus 14:29 | because it is written: “And the rest of the oil | Yoma 61a:16 | The Gemara analyzes this issue: <b>The Master said</b> above that everyone agrees that the <b>presentations of</b> oil placed on <b>the head</b> of the leper <b>are not indispensable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “And the rest of the oil</b> that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified, to make atonement for him before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:29), which indicates that this presentation involves only the rest of the oil and is therefore not an essential element of atonement, <b>however, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> consider the verse: <b>“But the rest of the meal-offering</b> shall be for Aharon and his sons; it is one of the sacred offerings of the Lord by fire” (Leviticus 2:3). Should we say, <b>so too, that they are not indispensable?</b> This cannot be the case, as the <i>halakha</i> is that if the remnants of the meal-offering are lost before the handful is burnt, the owner of the offering must bring another handful. |
| Leviticus 14:32 | whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification” | Arakhin 17b:13 | The Gemara explains: It <b>was stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: And</b> all <b>three of these</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse,</b> which deals with the destitute leper: “This is the law of him in whom is the mark of leprosy, <b>whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification”</b> (Leviticus 14:32). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> The individual’s status depends on <b>an item that atones,</b> and <b>what is it?</b> The <b>sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:32 | whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification” | Keritot 9b:15 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> All <b>three of them interpreted the same verse</b> to arrive at their respective opinions: “This is the law of he who has the mark of leprosy, <b>whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification”</b> (Leviticus 14:32). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the term “his purification” is referring to the <b>matter that atones for his</b> sin, i.e., the sin offering. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that it is referring to the <b>matter that renders him fit</b> to consume sacrificial meat, which is the guilt offering. And <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> that it is referring to the <b>matter that causes him</b> to return to a state of <b>purity. And what are these?</b> The <b>birds.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:34 | that it is written: “And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” | Bava Kamma82b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And</b> a house in Jerusalem does <b>not become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprous sores.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written: “And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> maintains that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. It is therefore not included in the description “a house of the land of your possession.” |
| Leviticus 14:34 | “And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” | Gittin 82a:12 | <b>Moreover,</b> an objection against this interpretation may be raised as follows: <b>Do</b> the <b>houses of gentiles become ritually impure</b> at all? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that from the verse: <b>“And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34), it is derived that only <b>the land of your possession,</b> i.e., the houses of Jews, <b>becomes impure through leprous sores</b> of the house, <b>but</b> the <b>houses of gentiles do not become impure through leprosy? Rather, conclude from</b> the mishna that the meaning of <i>ella</i> <b>is except.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Conclude from it</b> that <i>ella</i> means except. |
| Leviticus 14:34 | and I shall place the mark of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” | Horayot 10a:15 | The Sages <b>say: Yes,</b> there is a basis for that understanding, as <b>we find</b> that type of interpretation elsewhere; <b>as it is written:</b> “When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, <b>and I shall place the mark of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34). <b>These are tidings</b> informing <b>them,</b> i.e., the Jewish people, <b>that leprous marks</b> will <b>come upon them</b> when they enter Eretz Yisrael; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> This verse serves to teach that leprosy causes ritual impurity only when its origins are divine, <b>to the exclusion of leprosy</b> that results from <b>circumstances beyond one’s control,</b> i.e., those that have a clear physical cause. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that leprosy could be <b>tidings,</b> i.e., that there will definitely be leprosy? <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the king, <b>say</b> that <b>it is a decree</b> that he will sin. <b>Therefore, it is written: “If</b> the anointed priest shall sin,” meaning that the sin is not a given. |
| Leviticus 14:34 | in a house of the land of your possession” | Megillah 26a:9 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to leprosy of houses: “And I put the plague of leprosy <b>in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34), from which it may be inferred: <b>“Your possession,”</b> i.e., a privately owned house, <b>can become ritually impure with leprosy, but</b> a house in <b>Jerusalem cannot become ritually impure with leprosy,</b> as property there belongs collectively to the Jewish people and is not privately owned. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> this distinction stated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the site of the Temple alone,</b> but not with regard to the entire city of Jerusalem. |
| Leviticus 14:34 | it is written: “In a house of the land of your possession” | Nedarim 56a:3 | <b>Abaye said: Even if you would say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> is <b>the Rabbis,</b> they too <b>require a verse</b> to include the second story in this case, <b>as it might enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written: “In a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34), only that <b>which is attached to the ground</b> has the <b>status of a house</b> but with regard to <b>a second story, that is not attached to the ground.</b> Even according to the Rabbis, the verse is necessary to prevent the conclusion that the legal status of a second story is not that of a house with regard to leprosy. |
| Leviticus 14:34 | the verse states: “In a house of the land of your possession” | Yoma 11b:11 | <b>And say</b> it is <b>indeed so</b> that a woman’s house and a jointly owned house are excluded from the impurity of leprosy. The Gemara responds that <b>the verse states: “In a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34). The word your is written in the plural form to teach that all houses in Eretz Yisrael are subject to this impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, why do I</b> need the emphasis of the term: <b>His,</b> if every house is subject to the impurity of leprosy? The Gemara answers that the term does not teach a <i>halakha</i> but reveals why a house might be afflicted with leprosy. The house belonging to <b>one who dedicates his house to himself</b> alone, <b>who refuses to lend his vessels</b> to others <b>and says that he does not have</b> them, will be punished. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, publicizes his</b> possessions for all to see <b>when</b> he is forced to <b>empty</b> them from <b>his house</b> due to leprosy. <b>This excludes</b> one <b>who lends his vessels to others;</b> his house is not afflicted with leprosy. |
| Leviticus 14:34 | your possession” | Yoma 12a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And do</b> the synagogues <b>in</b> large <b>cities not become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprosy? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “In a house of the land of <b>your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34); the land of <b>your possession becomes ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprosy, and</b> the city of <b>Jerusalem does not become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprosy,</b> since it belongs to all the Jewish people rather than to a specific tribe? <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> that it is <b>only the site of the Temple [<i>mikdash</i>] alone</b> that does not become ritually impure with the impurity of leprosy. It can be inferred <b>that</b> in the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, even <b>synagogues and study halls</b> in Jerusalem <b>become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprosy, and</b> that is the case <b>even though they</b> are synagogues <b>in</b> large <b>cities.</b> The Gemara rejects this; rather, one must emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> that it is <b>only a sacred [<i>mekudash</i>] site alone.</b> That definition includes synagogues and study halls. |
| Leviticus 14:34 | for a possession, | Yoma 12a:7 | After discussing the status of Jerusalem, the Gemara addresses the matter of synagogues in villages. The Gemara asks: <b>And do</b> the synagogues <b>in villages become impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprosy? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> as follows? It is written: “When you enter the land of Canaan that I give you <b>for a possession,</b> and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” (Leviticus 14:34). The term: “For a possession,” means <b>until you conquer it</b> and it becomes entirely yours. However, in a case where <b>they conquered it but did not divide it among the tribes,</b> or where <b>they divided</b> it <b>among the tribes but did not distribute</b> it <b>to the patrilineal families;</b> or where <b>they distributed</b> it <b>to the patrilineal families, but every one</b> of them <b>does not recognize his</b> individual portion, <b>from where</b> is it derived that it does not become impure? |
| Leviticus 14:35 | And for stinginess, as it is written: “Then he that owns the house shall come | Arakhin 16a:12 | <b>And for stinginess, as it is written: “Then he that owns the house shall come</b> and tell the priest, saying: There seems to me to be as it were a mark in the house” (Leviticus 14:35). <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse calls him the one who owns the house <b>because</b> it is referring to <b>one who</b> was stingy and treated <b>his house</b> as being <b>exclusively his,</b> and did not allow others to share his property. |
| Leviticus 14:35 | “There seems to me as it were a plague in the house” | Moed Katan8a:10 | If so, <b>from where</b> does Rava derive the <i>halakha</i> that a priest examines leprous symptoms <b>during the day but not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse that quotes a homeowner saying to a priest: <b>“There seems to me as it were a plague in the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:35), which emphasizes that the leprous symptom is seen <b>by me, and not by</b> way of <b>my light,</b> i.e., that this takes place during the day. When the next verse states that the priest comes to view the leprous symptom, it means that this also takes place by day. |
| Leviticus 14:35 | taught | Nedarim 56a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of leprosy that in the verse “it appears to me as it were a plague in the house” (Leviticus 14:35), the term <b>“in the house”</b> comes <b>to include the gallery,</b> a half story above the ground floor, and <b>“in the house”</b> comes <b>to include the upper story? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> is <b>Rabbi Meir, as, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> were <b>the Rabbis, didn’t the Rabbis say</b> that <b>a second story is included in the house? Why</b> then <b>do I</b> need the <b>verse</b> containing the phrase <b>“in the house” to include</b> the second story? |
| Leviticus 14:35 | “And the one whom the house is his will come” | Yoma 11b:10 | § Apropos the <i>baraita</i> just cited, the Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i> that addresses a different topic. <b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A synagogue, a house</b> jointly owned by <b>partners, and a woman’s house become impure with</b> the impurity of <b>leprosy</b> of the house, like all other houses. The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious;</b> why wouldn’t they become impure? The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that it is written with regard to leprosy: <b>“And the one whom the house is his will come”</b> (Leviticus 14:35), which could be interpreted: <b>His and not hers; his and not theirs,</b> to the exclusion of a house owned by a woman or by partners. Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that these houses are also included in this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 14:35 | The verse states: “And the one whom the house is his will come” | Yoma 12a:8 | <b>The verse states: “And the one whom the house is his will come”</b> (Leviticus 14:35); one <b>whom</b> the house <b>is designated for him</b> and who is certain of his ownership, <b>excluding those</b> houses <b>which are not designated for him.</b> Apparently, the legal status of synagogues in villages is that of communal property, as the portion of each individual is not clearly identifiable, and therefore they cannot become impure. <b>Rather,</b> there is no distinction in this regard between synagogues in large cities and those in villages. And with regard to the original question, <b>it is clear as we responded initially</b> with alternative resolutions to the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i>. |
| Leviticus 14:36 | And for theft, as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they empty the house, | Arakhin 16a:11 | <b>And for theft, as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they empty the house,</b> before the priest go in to see the mark, that all that is in the house not become impure; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house” (Leviticus 14:36). In explanation of this verse, the Sages <b>taught: He gathered property that is not his,</b> therefore let <b>the priest come and scatter his property.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:36 | It says: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house | Moed Katan7b:11 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The ruling is correct, but <b>there is no need</b> to prove it from this verse, as a much simpler proof can be brought from a different source. <b>It says: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house</b> before the priest goes into it to see the plague, so that all that is in the house be not made unclean” (Leviticus 14:36). <b>If we delay</b> the priest’s examination of the house in order to give the owner time to remove his utensils and prevent them from contracting ritual impurity, which is merely <b>an optional matter, all the more so</b> should we delay his examination <b>for a matter of mitzva,</b> e.g., so as not to detract from the bridegroom’s joy or from the joy of a Festival. |
| Leviticus 14:36 | so that all that is in the house shall not be made impure” | Shevuot 17b:6 | <b>But I am afraid of my colleagues,</b> as they might raise the following objection: <b>If so,</b> that the impurity depends on the person entering the house in the normal manner, then even if <b>his entire</b> body entered the house, he would <b>also</b> be pure, as he did not go into the house in the normal fashion. <b>Rava said:</b> This is not difficult, as if <b>his entire</b> body entered in this manner, he is impure, because he is <b>no worse</b> now, i.e., his <i>halakha</i> should be no more lenient, <b>than vessels that are in the house,</b> which become impure, <b>as it is written:</b> “And they shall empty the house…<b>so that all that is in the house shall not be made impure”</b> (Leviticus 14:36). |
| Leviticus 14:37 | states above: | Bava Batra164b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah <b>states above:</b> “If the plague be in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:37). The verse did not state: <b>A wall,</b> but <b>“walls,”</b> indicating that the house in question has at least <b>two</b> walls. And where it <b>states below:</b> “If the plague has spread in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:39), instead of stating: <b>A wall,</b> the verse states <b>“walls,”</b> indicating another <b>two</b> walls. There <b>are</b> a total of <b>four</b> walls mentioned <b>here</b> in order to indicate that a house can become impure through leprous spots only if it has four sides. |
| Leviticus 14:37 | walls: | Nazir 8b:11 | The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> dealing with these same expressions: <b>The Sages taught: A round house, a two-sided</b> house, <b>a triangle-</b>shaped house, and <b>a pentagon-</b>shaped house <b>cannot become impure with leprosy,</b> whereas a house shaped like <b>a quadrilateral</b> can <b>become impure with leprosy. What is the reason</b> for this? In the verse <b>below it states,</b> when referring to <b>a wall,</b> the plural term <b>walls:</b> “And, behold, if the plague has spread in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:39). Additionally, in the verse <b>above it states,</b> when referring to <b>a wall,</b> the plural term <b>walls:</b> “And behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:37). These plural terms are unnecessary, and it is therefore understood that <b>there are four</b> walls mentioned <b>here</b> in order to indicate that a house can become impure through leprosy only if it has four sides. |
| Leviticus 14:37 | “walls” is written | Niddah 19a:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The word <b>“wall” is written</b> in the verse, <b>and</b> the word <b>“walls” is written</b> in the same verse: “And he shall see the leprous mark…in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and their appearance is lower than the wall” (Leviticus 14:37). <b>Which is</b> one <b>wall that is like two walls? You must say: This is a corner</b> between two walls. |
| Leviticus 14:37 | of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, | Sanhedrin 71a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a house does not become impure unless it has a mark precisely in the corner? The verse states: “And he shall look at the leprous mark, and, behold, if the leprous mark be in the walls of the house, in greenish or reddish depressions, which in sight are lower than the wall” (Leviticus 14:37). In one part of the verse <b>it is written “wall,” and</b> in another part of the verse <b>it is written “walls.” Which wall is like</b> two <b>walls? You must say this is a corner.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:37 | walls is written | Sanhedrin 87b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: The word <b>wall is written</b> in the verse <b>and</b> the word <b>walls is written</b> in the same verse: And he shall see the leprous mark…in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and their appearance is lower than the wall” (Leviticus 14:37). <b>Which is</b> one <b>wall that is like</b> multiple <b>walls? You must say: This is a corner</b> between two walls. The Rabbis hold that it is a leprous house even if the mark appears on one wall. Therefore, one who entered a house with a leprous mark on one wall and then entered the Temple is liable to receive <i>karet</i> according to the Rabbis; according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, he is not liable. |
| Leviticus 14:38 | “And the priest shall emerge from the house to the entrance of the house, and quarantine the house seven days” | Chullin 10b:8 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to leprosy of houses that after a priest views a leprous mark: <b>“And the priest shall emerge from the house to the entrance of the house, and quarantine the house seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:38). The Gemara asks: How can the priest quarantine the house based on his viewing the leprous mark? <b>Perhaps as he was emerging and coming</b> out of the house, the size of the leprous mark diminished and <b>it lacks</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for leprosy. <b>Rather, is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Establish</b> the status of <b>the matter on</b> the basis of <b>its presumptive status?</b> |
| Leviticus 14:38 | The verse states: “And he shall quarantine the house” | Nedarim 56b:10 | <b>How so?</b> <i>Ab initio</i>, the priest <b>stands</b> outside, <b>alongside the door jamb, and quarantines</b> the house. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if he went to his house and quarantined</b> the house, <b>or stood beneath the lintel and quarantined</b> the house, <b>that his quarantine is</b> an effective <b>quarantine</b> after the fact? <b>The verse states: “And he shall quarantine the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:38), which means <b>in any case.</b> Apparently, the legal status of the area beneath the lintel is identical to the status inside the house, even if it is beyond the doorstop. The Gemara answers: It <b>is different with regard to</b> a leprous <b>house, as it is written:</b> “And the priest shall go out <b>from the house,”</b> indicating that he cannot quarantine the house <b>until he goes out from the entire house.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:38 | “And the priest shall go out from the house | Nedarim 56b:9 | § We learned in the mishna: For <b>one who vows</b> that <b>a house</b> is forbidden <b>to</b> him, it <b>is prohibited</b> to enter <b>only from the doorstop and inward.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>However, from the doorstop outward, no,</b> it is permitted to enter. <b>Rav Mari raised an objection</b> based on a verse written with regard to leprosy: <b>“And the priest shall go out from the house</b> to the entrance of the house, and he shall quarantine the house” (Leviticus 14:38). And the question was raised in the halakhic midrash: One <b>might</b> have thought that the priest <b>may go to his house and quarantine</b> the leprous house that he examined from there. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the entrance of the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:38). <b>If</b> he may go only <b>to the entrance of the house,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may stand beneath the lintel and quarantine</b> the house from there. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall go out <b>from the house,”</b> indicating that he may not quarantine the house <b>until he goes out from the entire house.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:39 | states below: | Bava Batra164b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah <b>states above:</b> “If the plague be in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:37). The verse did not state: <b>A wall,</b> but <b>“walls,”</b> indicating that the house in question has at least <b>two</b> walls.

| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ] | Bekhorot 32a:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>What difference</b> is there whether or not an identical expression is used for a verbal analogy? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the same <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week also applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. Here too, the different terms of <i>pediya</i> and <i>geula</i> should not prevent the application of a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ] | Chullin 85a:14 | The Gemara asks: Being that both terms refer to slaughter, <b>what is the difference</b> which one is used; <b>didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ]” | Eruvin 51a:10 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is</b> significant about <b>the difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming;</b> it is after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference of one letter between <i>ḥutz</i> and <i>ḥutza</i>, should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ]” | Horayot 8b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what difference</b> is there between the different verb conjugations? <b>But didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. If a verbal analogy can be derived between two different terms, it can certainly be derived from two conjugations of the same term. <b>And furthermore, let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“and he is guilty,”</b> written <b>with regard to the defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as it is written: “And he is ritually impure and he is guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), which is a verbal analogy between identical terms. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ] | Makkot 13b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> significant <b>difference is there</b> between them that prevents derivation by means of a verbal analogy? <b>But didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week.

| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ] | Menachot 45b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there whether or not the words are identical? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> which applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week likewise applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. Certainly, if the <i>halakha</i> can be derived via a verbal analogy with the words <i>veshav</i> and <i>uva</i>, the even slighter difference in form between <i>yihyu</i> and <i>tihyena</i> should not prevent the application of a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ] | Menachot 4a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> the following verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse concerning the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week.

| Leviticus 14:39 | “and the priest shall return [ veshav ]” | Nazir 5a:8 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And what is the difference</b> between <i>yamim</i> and <i>yamima</i>? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the words <b>“and the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the words <b>“and the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44)? It is derived from this that just as <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., the priest returns after seven days, <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> which is also after seven days. Just as the Hebrew words <i>veshav</i> and <i>uva</i> can be used in a verbal analogy, certainly two words with a less pronounced variation, i.e., <i>yamim</i> and <i>yamima</i>, can be used to teach a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | walls: | Nazir 8b:11 | The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> dealing with these same expressions: <b>The Sages taught: A round house, a two-sided</b> house, <b>a triangle-</b>shaped house, and <b>a pentagon-</b>shaped house <b>cannot become impure with leprosy,</b> whereas a house shaped like <b>a quadrilateral</b> can <b>become impure with leprosy.

| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ] | Niddah 22b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there between formation and creation? A verbal analogy can be drawn between different words with similar meanings. For example, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses. The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “and the priest shall return [ veshav ]” | Yevamot 17b:5 | The Gemara objects: <b>What difference does it make</b> if there is a minor difference between the words being compared? <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse <b>“and the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse <b>“and the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days, and <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> that it is after seven days. Consequently, a less pronounced difference of one letter between the Hebrew words for “brothers” and “your brother” should certainly not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. The Gemara responds: <b>This applies when nothing</b> else <b>was</b> more <b>similar, but where there is something similar we infer from that which is more similar.</b> In such situations, it is preferable to learn from the word that bears greater similarity. |
| Leviticus 14:39 | “And the priest shall return [ veshav ]” | Yoma 2b:3 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is the practical difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44)? From that verbal analogy it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; and <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> i.e., it is also after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference in grammatical forms between <i>tziva</i> and <i>tzavoto</i> should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. |

| Leviticus 14:44 | “and the priest shall come [ uva ]” | Nazir 5a:8 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And what is the difference</b> between <i>yamim</i> and <i>yamima</i>? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the words <b>“and the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the words <b>“and the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44)? It is derived from this that just as <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., the priest returns after seven days, <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> which is also after seven days. Just as the Hebrew words <i>veshav</i> and <i>uva</i> can be used in a verbal analogy, certainly two words with a less pronounced variation, i.e., <i>yamim</i> and <i>yamima</i>, can be used to teach a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 14:44 | “And the priest shall come [ uva ] | Niddah 22b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there between formation and creation? A verbal analogy can be drawn between different words with similar meanings. For example, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses. The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. |
| Leviticus 14:44 | “and the priest shall come [ uva ]” | Yevamot 17b:5 | The Gemara objects: <b>What difference does it make</b> if there is a minor difference between the words being compared? <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse <b>“and the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse <b>“and the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days, and <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> that it is after seven days. Consequently, a less pronounced difference of one letter between the Hebrew words for “brothers” and “your brother” should certainly not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. The Gemara responds: <b>This applies when nothing</b> else <b>was</b> more <b>similar, but where there is something similar we infer from that which is more similar.</b> In such situations, it is preferable to learn from the word that bears greater similarity. |
| Leviticus 14:44 | “And the priest shall come [ uva ]” | Yoma 2b:3 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is the practical difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44)? From that verbal analogy it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; and <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> i.e., it is also after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference in grammatical forms between <i>tziva</i> and <i>tzavoto</i> should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 14:45 | There it is different, as the verse states: “And he shall break down the house” | Yevamot 103b:13 | The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as the verse states: “And he shall break down the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:45), which teaches that <b>even while it is being broken down it is</b> still <b>called a house,</b> until it is totally destroyed. Therefore, although for other purposes, objects that are required to be burned are considered crushed, the verse explicitly teaches that a house confirmed with leprosy is considered intact with regard to its ability to transmit ritual impurity to those who enter it. |
| Leviticus 14:46 | pure, as it is written: “He that enters into the house | Shevuot 17b:5 | The Gemara returns to the general topic of one who enters the Temple while in a state of ritual impurity, citing <b>Rabbi Oshaya,</b> who <b>said: I wish to say something, but I am afraid of my colleagues,</b> i.e., I am afraid that they will raise an objection against me. What did he want to say? With regard to <b>one who enters a house afflicted with leprosy,</b> if he enters the house <b>backward,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>his entire</b> body entered <b>except for his nose,</b> which remained outside the house, he remains <b>pure, as it is written: “He that enters into the house</b> all the time that it is shut up shall be impure until evening” (Leviticus 14:46), teaching that <b>the Torah prohibited,</b> i.e., conferred impurity, only with regard to <b>the normal manner of entering into</b> a house, i.e., face-first. |
| Leviticus 14:46 | “Moreover, one who enters the | Yevamot 103b:12 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that</b> an item with confirmed leprosy <b>is considered as if it were crushed</b> and not intact due to the requirement to burn it, <b>then</b> in order to contract ritual impurity through entering a house with leprosy, <b>we require</b> that there be a house, as the verse states: <b>“Moreover, one who enters the</b> house…shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 14:46)? <b>And this</b> requirement <b>is not</b> satisfied here, as the house confirmed with leprosy must be burned and consequently should be considered as if it is crushed and not intact. |
| Leviticus 14:50 | Another verse is written: “And he shall slaughter one of the birds | Sotah 16b:10 | <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive that one must <b>mix them</b> together? <b>Another verse is written: “And he shall slaughter one of the birds</b> in an earthen vessel over running water” (Leviticus 14:50). This indicates that the blood of the bird must fall directly into the water below, and the blood and the water will become mixed together. |
| Leviticus 14:51 | and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, | Sotah 16b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yishmael? As it is written</b> with regard to the process of the purification of a leper: “And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, <b>and dip them in the blood of the slain bird,</b> and in the running water” (Leviticus 14:51). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Had the verse stated only the phrase <b>“in the blood,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that these items must be dipped only <b>in</b> the <b>blood and</b> should <b>not</b> be dipped <b>in</b> the <b>water</b> at all. Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states: “In the</b> running <b>water.” If</b> the verse had stated only the phrase “in the running <b>water,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought they should be dipped only <b>in</b> the <b>water and not</b> be dipped <b>in</b> the <b>blood</b> at all. Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states: “In the blood.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? One must <b>bring</b> little enough <b>water</b> so <b>that the blood of the bird</b> will still <b>be recognizable within it. And how much</b> water is this? It is <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. |
| Leviticus 14:52 | as it is written: “And he shall purify [ veḥitte ] the house” | Chullin 27a:4 | <b>Rav Kahana says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to slaughter that it is</b> performed <b>from the neck?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>] the young bull</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>bends [<i>shaḥ</i>], purify it [<i>ḥattehu</i>]</b> through slaughter. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does one ascertain <b>that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of purification?</b> The Gemara answers: It is ascertained from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And he shall purify [<i>veḥitte</i>] the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is ascertained <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop and I will be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9). |
| Leviticus 14:52 | “ Veḥittei the house” | Niddah 31b:4 | The Gemara explains this derivation: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this term “<i>ḥet</i>” is</b> a reference <b>to purity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to leprosy of houses: <b>“<i>Veḥittei</i> the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52), <b>and we translate</b> the verse into Aramaic as: <b>And he shall purify the house. And if you wish, say</b> that the interpretation is derived <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop, and I shall be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9). Evidently, the root <i>ḥet</i>, <i>tet</i>, <i>alef</i> refers to purification. |
| Leviticus 14:56 | “And for a sore and for a scab [ sappaḥat ]” | Kiddushin 70b:15 | <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says: Converts are</b> as <b>difficult for the Jewish people as a scab.</b> The proof is <b>that it is stated: “And the convert shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave [<i>venispeḥu</i>] to the house of Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 14:1). <b>It is written here “<i>venispeḥu</i>,” and it is written there,</b> among the types of leprosy: <b>“And for a sore and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:56). The use of a term with a similar root indicates that converts are like a scab for the Jewish people. |
| Leviticus 14:56 | “For a sore, and for a scab [ sappaḥat ], | Shabbat 62b:21 | With regard to a different verse: <b>“The Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion</b> and the Lord will lay bare their secret parts” (Isaiah 3:17). And the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion; <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: This teaches that there was an outbreak of leprosy among them. It is written here, scab [<i>sippaḥ</i>], and it is written there,</b> among the types of leprosy: <b>“For a sore, and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>],</b> and for a bright spot” (Leviticus 14:56). |
| Leviticus 14:56 | of a se’et , the Merciful One states: “And for a se’et and for a sappaḥat ” | Shevuot 6a:1 | The Gemara answers: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted,</b> it would all be well <b>were it not for</b> the difficulty with regard to a mark the color of the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls, as the difficulty raised with regard to <b>an egg membrane–</b>colored mark is <b>not difficult. As even though</b> the shade of <b>an egg membrane</b> is two stages <b>below</b> that <b>of a <i>se’et</i>, the Merciful One states: “And for a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 14:56), which indicates that <b>a <i>sappaḥat</i> is secondary to a <i>se’et</i></b> and can combine with it <b>even though</b> a <i>sappaḥat</i> <b>is</b> of <b>a much lower</b> degree of brightness <b>than it.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that both of the additional shades not explicitly mentioned in the Torah are derived from the word: <i>Sappaḥat</i>, and so both of them can combine with a <i>se’et</i>. <b>But</b> the difficulty raised with regard to a mark the color of the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls is indeed <b>difficult. Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> |
| Leviticus 14:56 | “And for a sore [ se’et ] and for a scab [ sappaḥat ]” | Sotah 5b:1 | <b>“And for a sore [<i>se’et</i>] and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:56), <b>and <i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>elevated, as it is stated: “And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up [<i>nissaot</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). <b>And <i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>an appendage, as it is stated</b> in the context of the curse given to the descendants of Eli: <b>“Put me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>], I pray of you, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread”</b> (I Samuel 2:36). They will have to be joined with another priestly family to receive their priestly gifts. One can therefore interpret the verses discussing leprosy as teaching that one who initially is arrogant, <i>se’et</i>, will eventually become a <i>sappaḥat</i>, diminished in stature. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | any man | Arakhin 3a:4 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the clause in the mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>]?</b> This serves <b>to add</b> that even <b>a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge becomes impure. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>A man. Why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2)? This serves <b>to include a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that</b> even <b>he becomes impure as</b> one who experiences <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | “out of his flesh” | Chullin 51b:1 | <b>becomes</b> ritually <b>impure</b> if he experiences a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>]. And if it should enter your mind</b> that a newborn <b>is subject to</b> concern about possible <b>shattered limbs, read here</b> the ruling stated with regard to <i>ziva</i>, that one’s discharge renders one impure only when it issues <b>“out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2), <b>but not</b> when it issues <b>due to circumstances beyond his control,</b> e.g., due to illness. Therefore, if one must be concerned that a newborn’s limbs may have shattered during birth, his discharge would not render him impure. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | As it is taught | Keritot 8b:8 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When any man has a discharge from his flesh, his discharge is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). The term <b>“from his flesh”</b> teaches that the discharge is impure only if it is due to an internal cause, <b>and not due to his accident. And</b> furthermore, a <i>zav</i> <b>becomes impure by</b> three <b>sightings</b> of gonorrhea-like discharge on one day <b>like</b> he becomes impure <b>by</b> three such sightings on three consecutive <b>days, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The verse links</b> the impurity of <b>the male,</b> i.e., a <i>zav</i>, <b>to</b> the number of <b>sightings</b> on the same day or on consecutive days, <b>and</b> of <b>the female</b> <i>zava</i> <b>to</b> the number of consecutive <b>days</b> on which she experiences sightings of blood. <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>a <i>zava</i> becomes impure</b> if she has a discharge <b>by accident, and does not become impure by</b> three <b>sightings</b> on one day <b>like</b> she becomes impure <b>by</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days.</b> Therefore, the mishna counts them as two separate cases. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two | Megillah 8a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions: “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his emission he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), <b>and it called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure.</b> Another verse enumerated <b>three</b> emissions: “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3), <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure. How so?</b> If he is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity and three to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | any man | Niddah 32b:6 | § The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of <i>ziva</i> with regard to a male: <b>And so with regard to males,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply even to minor boys. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning a <i>zav</i>: “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “any man”?</b> The verse serves <b>to include a one-day-old baby,</b> teaching <b>that</b> even <b>he is susceptible to impurity of <i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, when any man has an issue [ zav ] | Niddah 34a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Beit Shammai the blood of a gentile woman does not impart impurity. The Gemara objects: <b>And do Beit Shammai not accept</b> that which is taught with regard to the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, when any man has an issue [<i>zav</i>]</b> out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), from which it is inferred: By Torah law, <b>the children of Israel become impure through <i>ziva</i> and gentiles do not become impure through <i>ziva</i>, but</b> the Sages <b>decreed concerning them that they shall be like <i>zavin</i> in all their matters</b> of ritual purity. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | his issue [ zovo ] is unclean” | Niddah 34b:18 | <b>Rava says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue [<i>zovo</i>] is unclean”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse <b>teaches with regard to the <i>zov</i> that it is impure,</b> and that it imparts impurity through carrying. <b>To what</b> case is the verse referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to</b> one who is <b>just a <i>zav</i></b> and not a leper as well, and the verse is teaching that any drop of <i>ziva</i> emitted by him imparts impurity through carrying, |
| Leviticus 15:2 | out of his flesh” | Niddah 35a:8 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the latter clause of the same mishna: <b>When</b> he experiences <b>the second</b> sighting of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. <b>For what</b> purpose does one examine him? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>to</b> exempt him from bringing <b>an offering</b> in the event that he experiences a third discharge <b>but not to</b> clarify that he does not have <b>ritual impurity,</b> this is untenable, as one may <b>read here</b> the verse: “An issue <b>out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2), from which it is derived that one is <b>not</b> rendered a <i>zav</i> if the discharge occurred <b>due to circumstances beyond his control. Rather, is it not</b> that the examination serves <b>to</b> clarify that he does not have <b>ritual impurity? And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the examination in <b>the latter clause</b> is <b>for</b> purposes of <b>impurity,</b> one may conclude that the examination of <b>the first clause</b> is <b>also for</b> purposes of <b>impurity.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | has an issue out of his flesh” | Niddah 43a:5 | § The mishna teaches that a woman becomes ritually impure with the flow of blood from the uterus into the vagina, even if it did not leave the woman’s body. <b>But the <i>zav</i> and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure</b> until their emission of impurity emerges outside the body. The Gemara explains: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “When</b> any man <b>has an issue out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse teaches that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>until his issue emerges out of his flesh.</b> With regard to <b>one who experiences a seminal emission,</b> the reason is <b>that it is written: “And if the flow of seed goes out from a man”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that the flow must exit his body. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | impure: | Niddah 43b:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions <b>and called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure:</b> “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his issue he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). And yet, another verse enumerates <b>three</b> emissions <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? If one is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach that <b>two</b> emissions are necessary <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity, and three</b> are necessary <b>to</b> render a <i>zav</i> liable to bring <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | His issue is impure | Niddah 43b:12 | The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the last part of the previous verse, which can be read as: <b>His issue is impure</b> (Leviticus 15:2)? The Gemara explains that this <b>teaches with regard to the issue</b> itself <b>that it is impure,</b> i.e., not only does it render the man who emitted it impure, but the substance itself is impure and imparts impurity to others by contact. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | any man | Niddah 44a:4 | The mishna further teaches that <b>a baby boy,</b> even one who is <b>one day old,</b> can become impure with the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. Once again, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a <i>zav</i>: “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). It would have been enough for the verse to state “a man.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “any man”?</b> It is in order <b>to include</b> even <b>a one-day-old</b> baby boy who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that he becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | impure” | Niddah 55a:15 | § The mishna teaches: <b>But <i>ziva</i></b> transmits impurity when moist, although not when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>ziva</i></b> transmits impurity? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the verse: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). This <b>taught with regard to <i>ziva</i> that it is impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | impure” | Niddah 55b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have derived</b> the impurity of the discharge of a <i>zav</i> <b>from</b> the verse: “And <b>of one who emits his issue”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2)? |
| Leviticus 15:2 | impure” | Niddah 55b:6 | Since one would not have derived the impurity of <i>ziva</i> from this verse, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “His issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). <b>And now that the Merciful One states: “His issue, it is impure,”</b> one <b>may derive from</b> the verse “and of one who emits his issue” not only the number of emissions, but <b>also this</b> interpretation, that there is no difference between the impurity imparted by <i>ziva</i> by contact and by carrying. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | the verse states: “His issue, it is impure” | Niddah 56a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that blood that issues from the opening of the penis is pure? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a <i>zav</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>blood that issues from his mouth or from the opening of the penis is impure,</b> like his saliva and urine. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His issue, it is impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The term “it” is an exclusion, indicating that <b>it,</b> <i>ziva</i>, <b>is impure, but blood that issues from his mouth or from the opening of the penis is not impure; rather, it is pure.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:2 | out of his flesh” | Niddah 71a:7 | But this is difficult, as <b>I will apply here</b> the principle stated with regard to a <i>zav</i>: “An issue <b>out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2) renders a man impure, <b>but not</b> an issue <b>due to circumstances beyond his control.</b> If a man has a discharge of <i>ziva</i> due to an illness or some accident, he does not become impure. Consequently, if he has a discharge due to fear after seeing the Angel of Death, he would not become ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | “Speak to the children of Israel | Shabbat 83a:3 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what we learned: <b>A gentile man and a gentile woman,</b> with regard to whom the Rabbis issued a decree that they transmit impurity like a <i>zav</i>, <b>idolatry and its accessories,</b> all transmit impurity. <b>They</b> transmit impurity, <b>and not their movement,</b> i.e., they do not transmit impurity to one who moves them. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Both <b>they and their movement</b> transmit impurity. <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> this works out <b>well; however,</b> according <b>to</b> the explanation of <b>Rabba, it is difficult. Rabba</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to your reasoning,</b> with regard to <b>a gentile man and a gentile woman as well,</b> do <b>they</b> transmit impurity <b>and their movement</b> does <b>not</b> transmit impurity? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel</b> and say to them, when any man has an emission from his body, his emission is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), by Torah law, only <b>the children of Israel become impure through</b> the <b>emission of a <i>zav</i>, and gentiles do not become impure through</b> the <b>emission of a <i>zav</i>? But</b> the Sages <b>decreed that they should be</b> considered <b>like a <i>zav</i> for all their</b> halakhic <b>matters.</b> Since gentiles have the legal status of a <i>zav</i>, they should transmit impurity through carrying. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> that states that gentiles do not transmit impurity through carrying is corrupted and must be emended. |
| Leviticus 15:2 | the verse states: “His discharge is impure” | Yevamot 105a:20 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that states with regard to a <i>zav</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that blood that issues from his mouth or from the opening of his genital organ should be ritually impure,</b> like any of the secretions that issue from a <i>zav</i> e.g., saliva and urine; therefore, <b>the verse states: “His discharge is impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2), to teach: Only his white, pus-like discharge and other secretions similar to it are ritually impure, <b>but blood that issues from his mouth or from his genital organ is not impure, but it is pure.</b> And from here one may learn that blood can issue from the mouth without saliva, for if it was as they said, that all spittle necessarily contains saliva, the blood in the spittle would be ritually impure due to the saliva. |
| Leviticus 15:3 | “And this shall be his ritual impurity when he has a discharge” | Bava Kamma24a:2 | Rabbi Meir <b>said to them:</b> The case of the <i>zava</i> does not disprove my opinion, because the verse <b>states</b> in reference to the parallel <i>halakha</i> of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]: <b>“And this shall be his ritual impurity when he has a discharge”</b> (Leviticus 15:3). The word “this” emphasizes that in this matter the <i>halakha</i> requires following the instructions of the verse precisely as they were recorded, and in this case <b>the verse associates</b> the impurity of <b>the <i>zav</i> with</b> the number of <b>sightings</b> of discharges the man observed, <b>and</b> it associates <b>the</b> impurity of the <b><i>zava</i> with</b> the number of <b>days</b> during which she experienced sightings of blood, as it says: “Many days” (Leviticus 15:25). By contrast, with regard to the goring ox, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference remains in place. |
| Leviticus 15:3 | three | Megillah 8a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions: “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his emission he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), <b>and it called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure.</b> Another verse enumerated <b>three</b> emissions: “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3), <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure. How so?</b> If he is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity and three to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:3 | called him impure: | Niddah 43b:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions <b>and called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure:</b> “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his issue he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). And yet, another verse enumerates <b>three</b> emissions <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? If one is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach that <b>two</b> emissions are necessary <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity, and three</b> are necessary <b>to</b> render a <i>zav</i> liable to bring <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:3 | or his flesh be stopped from his issue, | Niddah 43b:3 | § The mishna teaches that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount. Shmuel says:</b> In order for <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to become ritually impure, he <b>must</b> experience a discharge substantial enough <b>to</b> cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis, as it is stated:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue, <b>or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). |
| Leviticus 15:3 | or his flesh be stopped from his issue, | Niddah 43b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> i.e., what is the source in the Torah for his ruling? The Gemara answers: His source is, as mentioned above, <b>that the verse states:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue, <b>or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). This verse indicates that the emission must be enough to cause a blockage of his penis. |
| Leviticus 15:3 | as it is written: “His flesh runs | Niddah 56a:14 | § The mishna teaches that the <i>ziva</i> of a <i>zav</i>, the mucus and saliva of a <i>zav</i>, the carcass of a creeping animal, an animal carcass, and semen all <b>transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>moist,</b> but they do not transmit impurity when they are dry. The Gemara cites the sources for these <i>halakhot</i>: The <i>ziva</i> of <b>a <i>zav</i></b> transmits impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written: “His flesh runs</b> with his issue” (Leviticus 15:3), which is referring to a moist discharge. <b>His phlegm and his mucus and his saliva</b> likewise transmit impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written:</b> “And <b>if one who has an issue spits”</b> (Leviticus 15:8), which is referring to a substance <b>that is like saliva,</b> which is moist. |
| Leviticus 15:4 | the verse states: | Niddah 54b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Every bed upon which the <i>zav</i> lies shall be impure, and every item upon which he sits shall be impure” (Leviticus 15:4). The term <b>“the <i>zav</i>”</b> indicates that only <b>the <i>zav</i>, and not a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy, renders items designated for lying or sitting impure. The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason</b> a stone afflicted with leprosy does not transmit impurity to items designated for lying or sitting is <b>that the verse excluded it, but</b> were it <b>not so,</b> the stone <b>would transmit impurity</b> to items designated for lying or sitting, despite the fact that the concepts of lying and sitting do not apply to a stone. |
| Leviticus 15:4 | and every vessel on which he is sitting | Shabbat 59a:3 | And with regard to the essence of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, the Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yoḥanan not require</b> that the vessel’s new usage must be <b>of the</b> same <b>type as the original labor</b> in order for it to retain its ritual impurity after it has undergone change? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Every bed on which a <i>zav</i> is lying is ritually impure <b>and every vessel on which he is sitting</b> shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 15:4). <b>I might</b> have thought, based on this verse, that if one <b>overturned</b> a vessel the size of <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it, or overturned</b> a vessel the size of <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>tarkav</i>] and sat on it,</b> the vessel <b>would become ritually impure.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: On which the <i>zav</i> is sitting,</b> i.e., <b>that which is designated for sitting, excluding that</b> vessel <b>with regard to which one says</b> to the <i>zav</i>: <b>Stand and we will perform our labor</b> with the vessel. In that case, because the vessel is primarily used for purposes other than sitting, it does not become ritually impure even when the <i>zav</i> sits on it. |
| Leviticus 15:4 | it is written: “Every bed on which the zav lies shall be impure; | Shabbat 84b:2 | Rabbi Ila <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>May the all-Merciful save us from this opinion.</b> Rabbi Ḥanina responded: <b>On the contrary, may the all-Merciful save us from your opinion. And what is the reason</b> that this is relevant? What is the significance of the fact that other vessels of its kind can be purified in a ritual bath if the vessel itself cannot be purified in a ritual bath? It is because <b>two verses are written.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “And whoever touches his bed</b> shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:5). The verse juxtaposes his bed to himself. Just as he has the possibility of purification through immersion in a ritual bath, so too, his bed has the possibility of purification in a ritual bath. This teaches that his bed has the same legal status as he does; in order for a bed on which a <i>zav</i> lies to be subject to the impurity imparted by lying, it must be immersible in a ritual bath. <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “Every bed on which the <i>zav</i> lies shall be impure;</b> and every vessel on which he sits shall be impure” (Leviticus 15:4). This verse includes all beds on which a <i>zav</i> might lie, even one that cannot be purified in a ritual bath. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> two verses be reconciled? If <b>there is</b> purification <b>in</b> other vessels <b>of its kind, even though it</b> itself <b>does not have purification in a ritual bath,</b> it is subject to the impurity imparted by lying. However, if <b>there is no</b> purification <b>in</b> other vessels <b>of its kind,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes his bed to himself.</b> Any vessel that is not like him in the sense that it cannot be purified in a ritual bath, is not subject to impurity imparted by lying. |
| Leviticus 15:5 | that which is taught | Bava Kamma66b:5 | <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye in refutation of this proof: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> consider <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to a <i>zav</i>, a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge: “And whoever touches his bedding shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:5). This indicates that bedding on which a <i>zav</i> lies can become ritually impure and impart impurity only if it is <b>“his bedding,” but not</b> if it is <b>stolen</b> bedding. |
| Leviticus 15:5 | “And whoever touches his bed” | Niddah 33a:1 | <b>If we say</b> the verse is teaching that a mattress <b>beneath a <i>zav</i></b> is impure, this is already <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And whoever touches his bed”</b> (Leviticus 15:5). <b>Rather,</b> the verse is referring to that <b>which touches any</b> item <b>under which the <i>zav</i> will be. And what is this</b> item? It is the bedding <b>above a <i>zav</i>.</b> The verse teaches that the bedding above a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 15:5 | as the verse states: “And whoever touches his bed | Shabbat 84a:4 | The Gemara questions what was stated: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that with regard to impurity imparted by <b>treading, an earthenware vessel is ritually pure? Ḥizkiya said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And whoever touches his bed</b> shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:5). The verse <b>juxtaposes his bed to himself. Just as he has</b> the possibility of <b>purification</b> through immersion <b>in a ritual bath, so too, his bed</b> is referring to a vessel that <b>has</b> the possibility of <b>purification in a ritual bath.</b> Since an impure earthenware vessel cannot be purified in a ritual bath, unlike other vessels, it does not become ritually impure when a <i>zav</i> lies on it. |
| Leviticus 15:5 | it is written: “And whoever touches his bed | Shabbat 84b:2 | Rabbi Ila <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>May the all-Merciful save us from this opinion.</b> Rabbi Ḥanina responded: <b>On the contrary, may the all-Merciful save us from your opinion. And what is the reason</b> that this is relevant? What is the significance of the fact that other vessels of its kind can be purified in a ritual bath if the vessel itself cannot be purified in a ritual bath? It is because <b>two verses are written.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “And whoever touches his bed</b> shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:5). The verse juxtaposes his bed to himself. Just as he has the possibility of purification through immersion in a ritual bath, so too, his bed has the possibility of purification in a ritual bath. This teaches that his bed has the same legal status as he does; in order for a bed on which a <i>zav</i> lies to be subject to the impurity imparted by lying, it must be immersible in a ritual bath. <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “Every bed on which the <i>zav</i> lies shall be impure;</b> and every vessel on which he sits shall be impure” (Leviticus 15:4). This verse includes all beds on which a <i>zav</i> might lie, even one that cannot be purified in a ritual bath. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> two verses be reconciled? If <b>there is</b> purification <b>in</b> other vessels <b>of its kind, even though it</b> itself <b>does not have purification in a ritual bath,</b> it is subject to the impurity imparted by lying. However, if <b>there is no</b> purification <b>in</b> other vessels <b>of its kind,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes his bed to himself.</b> Any vessel that is not like him in the sense that it cannot be purified in a ritual bath, is not subject to impurity imparted by lying. |
| Leviticus 15:6 | “And he who sits on any object | Chagigah 23b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye said:</b> When they said that the Sages did not make innovations, they were not referring to something of this nature, but meant that <b>they did not say</b> that <b>a spade</b> upon which a <i>zav</i> sits <b>can become impure as a seat.</b> They thereby preserved the basic <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And he who sits on any object</b> whereon the <i>zav</i> sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that if a <i>zav</i> <b>turned over</b> a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it,</b> or if he turned over a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> i.e., a half-<i>se’a</i>, <b>and sat on it,</b> that the vessel <b>should be</b> rendered <b>impure</b> as a seat upon which a <i>zav</i> sat. |
| Leviticus 15:6 | sits…and be unclean | Chagigah 23b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he who sits on any object whereon</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>sits…and be unclean</b> until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). The wording of the verse indicates that it is speaking of an object <b>that is designated for sitting,</b> i.e., upon which people generally sit, <b>excluding such</b> a vessel for <b>which we would say to</b> someone sitting on it: <b>Stand up, so we can do our work.</b> A spade and a measuring bowl, then, are not subject to the impurity of the seat of a <i>zav</i>, even if a <i>zav</i> sat on them. Rather, they are considered to be on the lower level of impurity transmitted through simple contact with a <i>zav</i>. The same <i>halakha</i> was applied to the vessels used in preparation of the red heifer; the Sages did not add stringency and decree that a vessel not generally used for sitting should be considered as the seat of a <i>zav</i>. |
| Leviticus 15:6 | object | Niddah 49b:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the impurity of the treading of a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And he who sits on</b> any <b>object</b> whereon the <i>zav</i> sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that if a <i>zav</i> <b>turned over</b> a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it, or</b> if he turned over a vessel used to measure <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> and sat on it,</b> that vessel <b>should be</b> rendered <b>impure</b> as a seat upon which a <i>zav</i> sat. |
| Leviticus 15:6 | whereon the zav sits” | Niddah 49b:11 | Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he who sits on any object <b>whereon the <i>zav</i> sits”</b> (Leviticus 15:6). The wording of the verse indicates that it is speaking of an object <b>that is designated for sitting,</b> i.e., upon which people generally sit, <b>excluding such</b> a vessel, with regard to <b>which we say to</b> someone sitting on it: <b>Stand up and</b> allow us to use it to <b>do our work,</b> i.e., to measure. This is not defined as a vessel used for sitting, as it serves another function. |
| Leviticus 15:8 | spits | Niddah 55b:7 | § The mishna teaches: And the mucus <b>and the saliva</b> of a <i>zav</i> transmit impurity when moist but not when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the ritual impurity of the <b>saliva</b> of a <i>zav</i>? The Gemara answers that this is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And if</b> one who has an issue <b>spits</b> on the pure person, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and he is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:8). One <b>might</b> have thought that the saliva transmits impurity even if the <i>zav</i> merely spat in the direction of a pure person, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that it did not</b> come into <b>contact</b> with him. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if one who has an issue spits <b>on the pure person,”</b> which teaches that <b>unless</b> the saliva comes into <b>contact with the pure person</b> he is not rendered impure. |
| Leviticus 15:8 | if one who has an issue spits” | Niddah 56a:14 | § The mishna teaches that the <i>ziva</i> of a <i>zav</i>, the mucus and saliva of a <i>zav</i>, the carcass of a creeping animal, an animal carcass, and semen all <b>transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>moist,</b> but they do not transmit impurity when they are dry. The Gemara cites the sources for these <i>halakhot</i>: The <i>ziva</i> of <b>a <i>zav</i></b> transmits impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written: “His flesh runs</b> with his issue” (Leviticus 15:3), which is referring to a moist discharge. <b>His phlegm and his mucus and his saliva</b> likewise transmit impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written:</b> “And <b>if one who has an issue spits”</b> (Leviticus 15:8), which is referring to a substance <b>that is like saliva,</b> which is moist. |
| Leviticus 15:8 | by Torah law, as it is written: “And if a zav spits on a pure person | Shabbat 14b:4 | <b>And</b> among the decrees that were listed, there is also the decree concerning <b>the vessels that became impure</b> through contact <b>with liquids.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Vessels that became impure</b> due to contact <b>with liquids that</b> became impure due to contact with <b>what</b> source of impurity? <b>If you say</b> that they become impure due to contact <b>with liquids</b> secreted by <b>a <i>zav</i>,</b> e.g., spittle, urine, etc., <b>they are</b> impure <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “And if a <i>zav</i> spits on a pure person</b> and he should wash his clothes and wash in water and he is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:8). The Sages interpreted homiletically: <b>Whatever is in the hand of the pure person I made impure for you.</b> Not only did the person who came into contact with the liquids of the <i>zav</i> become impure, but the objects in his hand did as well. <b>Rather,</b> here it is referring <b>to liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal,</b> which by Torah law do not transmit impurity to vessels. <b>And</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> with regard to those liquids <b>due to</b> their similarity to the <b>liquids of a <i>zav</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:9 | the school of Rabbi Yishmael: A person should always converse euphemistically, as | Pesachim 3a:12 | Likewise, a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: A person should always converse euphemistically, as</b> one finds in the following verses. The first: “And whichever saddle that the <i>zav</i> rides upon shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 15:9), which discusses the impurity imparted by <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to an object on which he sits, <b>calls</b> this action <b>riding. And</b> the verse: “And anyone who touches anything on which she sat” (Leviticus 15:22), which discusses the parallel ritual impurity <b>of a woman,</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>calls</b> the action <b>sitting.</b> Since riding is slightly demeaning for a woman, as it involves an immodest splaying of the legs, the verse avoids the term riding and opts to convey the more modest image of sitting. <b>And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“And you choose the language of the crafty”</b> (Job 15:5), meaning that one should be clever when speaking and avoid inappropriate phrases. <b>And it says</b> in another verse: “My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; <b>and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely”</b> (Job 33:3). |
| Leviticus 15:9 | and it is written: “And whatever saddle [ hamerkav ] he that has a discharge rides upon shall be unclean” | Sanhedrin 48b:15 | The Gemara clarifies: The curse of being afflicted <b>“with a discharge,”</b> i.e., a <i>zav</i>, was fulfilled among Solomon’s descendants <b>in Rehoboam, as it is written: “And King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot [<i>bamerkava</i>] to flee to Jerusalem”</b> (I Kings 12:18), <b>and it is written: “And whatever saddle [<i>hamerkav</i>] he that has a discharge rides upon shall be unclean”</b> (Leviticus 15:9). The similarity between the words <i>merkava</i> and <i>merkav</i> indicates that Rehoboam was a <i>zav</i>. |
| Leviticus 15:10 | “And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be impure” | Niddah 32b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the bedding <b>above a <i>zav</i></b> imparts ritual impurity only to food and drink? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression <b>“under him”?</b> |
| Leviticus 15:10 | shall be impure” | Niddah 33a:4 | The Gemara objects: <b>Say</b> that <b>the verse removed</b> the bedding above a <i>zav</i> <b>from severe impurity,</b> in the sense <b>that it does not impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> the extent that he may in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to the <b>garments</b> he is wearing. <b>But let</b> the bedding above a <i>zav</i> <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>people or garments.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “And whoever touches anything that was under him <b>shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:10), which <b>indicates lesser impurity.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:10 | and he that carries them | Niddah 55a:2 | <b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response: Items designated for lying or sitting also transmit impurity to items that lie beneath a very heavy stone. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to an item of this kind, which was rendered impure by a <i>zav</i>: “And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be impure until the evening, <b>and he that carries them</b> shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:10). The term <b>“them” is an exclusion,</b> indicating that items designated for lying or sitting transmit impurity to items that lie beneath a very heavy stone, but menstrual blood does not. |
| Leviticus 15:11 | “And whomever he that has the issue touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,” | Chullin 106a:12 | <b>And</b> the obligation is <b>further due to</b> its being <b>a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What mitzva</b> does it involve? <b>Abaye says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to listen to</b> and obey <b>the statements of the Sages,</b> who instituted this washing of the hands. <b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to listen to the statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, as it is written</b> with regard to a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]: <b>“And whomever he that has the issue touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,”</b> he contracts ritual impurity (Leviticus 15:11), and <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh says: From here the Sages based washing of the hands</b> upon a verse <b>from the Torah.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:11 | The Merciful One states: “Whom he touches” | Kiddushin 25a:12 | <b>Ulla says: All concede with regard to a tongue</b> that <b>in the matter of ritual impurity it is</b> considered <b>exposed with respect to a dead creeping animal</b> and other items that impart impurity. In other words, if an individual comes into contact with a source of ritual impurity with his tongue, he is rendered impure. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states: “Whom he touches”</b> (Leviticus 15:11), <b>and this</b> tongue <b>can also touch.</b> It is possible for one to touch objects with his tongue. |
| Leviticus 15:11 | As the verse states: “And whoever a zav touches, without having rinsed his hands in water, | Niddah 43a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that if a <i>zav</i> moved another with a pole in his own folds he does not render the other person impure? <b>As the verse states: “And whoever a <i>zav</i> touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,</b> he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water” (Leviticus 15:11). <b>This is</b> referring to the impurity imparted by <b>the movement of a <i>zav</i>, as we have not found an impurity</b> similar <b>to it in the entire Torah.</b> Only a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity to items by moving them. |
| Leviticus 15:13 | The Merciful One states: “And he shall immerse his flesh in water” | Kiddushin 25a:13 | Similarly, all agree about a tongue with regard <b>to the matter of immersion</b> that the tongue <b>is considered concealed,</b> and therefore one need not open his mouth so that the water touches his tongue. For an immersion to be valid, the water must come into contact with the entire outside of one’s body. Ulla teaches that this does not include the tongue. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states: “And he shall immerse his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 15:13). <b>Just as his flesh is on the outside, so too everything</b> that requires immersion is <b>on the outside,</b> and this does not include what is ordinarily on the inside. |
| Leviticus 15:13 | “And when the zav is cleansed from his emission” | Megillah 8a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you said</b> that the term: <b>From his emission,</b> is exclusionary and comes <b>for derivation, what do you derive from</b> the verse: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed from his emission”</b> (Leviticus 15:13)? |
| Leviticus 15:13 | “And when the zav is cleansed | Megillah 8a:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is needed to</b> derive <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed</b> from his emission, then he shall count to himself seven days for his purification” (Leviticus 15:13), <b>when</b> his emissions <b>cease.</b> The <i>baraita</i> infers from the term: <b>From his emission,</b> that he needs to be cleansed only <b>from his emission, but not from his emission and his leprosy.</b> If one was both a <i>zav</i> and also had leprosy, he need not wait until he is asymptomatic of his leprosy before counting seven clean days. Rather, he counts seven clean days, and after the leprosy symptoms cease, he immerses for both impurities. <b>“From his emission, then he shall count”: This teaches concerning a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions, that he</b> too <b>requires a count of seven</b> clean days. |
| Leviticus 15:13 | and he shall be clean [ vetaher ]” | Megillah 8b:10 | <b>Rava said to him: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> i.e., that <i>vetaher</i> means that one is somewhat pure at the outset, then <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “And he shall wash his clothes,</b> and bathe his flesh in running water, <b>and he shall be clean [<i>vetaher</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 15:13), <b>there, what</b> sense <b>of: And he shall be clean, at the outset is there</b> in that case? Up until that point, the <i>zav</i> was ritually impure in every sense. |
| Leviticus 15:13 | the Merciful One states: | Niddah 33b:4 | The Gemara rejects Rava’s response: <b>And according to your reasoning, how does a <i>zav</i> himself negate</b> only one day from his count due to a seminal emission? After all, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And when the <i>zav</i> is purified of his <i>ziva</i>, then he shall count for himself seven days for his purification, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and he shall be pure” (Leviticus 15:13). The phrase: “Seven days <b>for his purification,”</b> indicates <b>that there should be no impurity separating between them.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:13 | “And when the zav is purified of his ziva ” | Niddah 37a:18 | <b>And Rava</b> would respond: <b>What is this</b> suggestion? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> taught: <b>From her <i>ziva</i> and not from her</b> giving <b>birth,</b> one can understand why the <i>tanna</i> also teaches: From her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy: <b>Since it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>birth,</b> he <b>taught</b> it with regard to <b>her leprosy, due to</b> the fact that he taught it with regard to <b>birth. But if you say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> taught only: <b>From her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy,</b> then the verse is unnecessary, as <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> another verse: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is purified of his <i>ziva</i>”</b> (Leviticus 15:13), i.e., <b>from his <i>ziva</i> and not from his leprosy.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:13 | “And he shall wash his flesh in water” | Yoma 31a:6 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>All the entrances that were there</b> in the Temple, <b>their height is twenty cubits and their width is ten cubits, except for</b> the entrance <b>to the Entrance Hall</b> of the Sanctuary, which was twice that, i.e., forty cubits high and twenty cubits wide. <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated: <b>“And he shall wash his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 15:13), and it is stated in another verse: “And he shall wash all of his flesh in water”(Leviticus 15:16). This refers to water known as <b>the waters of a ritual bath.</b> The verse adds the emphasis: <b>All of his flesh,</b> to say that immersion must be <b>in water that one’s entire body enters</b> at the same time. <b>And how much</b> water <b>is it?</b> It is <b>one cubit</b> length <b>by one cubit</b> width <b>by a height of three cubits.</b> That is sufficient water to cover a person’s height. <b>And the Sages calculated</b> that the volume of <b>the waters of a ritual bath</b> that fit into that space is <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:14 | and come before the Lord to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest” | Nazir 44b:5 | § <b>Abaye said: I encountered</b> the members of <b>the assembly of Rav Natan bar Hoshaya sitting and saying</b> the following: The verse states with regard to a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] who immerses on the seventh day of his purification: “And on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons <b>and come before the Lord to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 15:14). <b>When</b> does <b>he come</b> to the courtyard to sacrifice his offerings? Only <b>when he has immersed</b> on the seventh day <b>and performed</b> the requirement to wait until <b>sunset.</b> In that case, <b>yes,</b> he brings his offerings, but if he <b>has not immersed and</b> has not <b>performed</b> the requirement to wait until <b>sunset, no,</b> he may not enter the courtyard. |
| Leviticus 15:15 | “And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord from his emission” | Megillah 8a:13 | The Gemara raises a different alternative. <b>And say</b> instead: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering, but not to</b> establish <b>impurity; three</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity as well.</b> The Gemara answers that this suggestion <b>cannot enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord from his emission”</b> (Leviticus 15:15). The preposition “from” that precedes the words “his emissions” indicates that <b>some</b> with the status of a <b><i>zav</i> bring an offering and some</b> with the status of a <b><i>zav</i> do not bring an offering. How so?</b> If <b>he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he brings</b> an offering; if he experienced <b>two</b> emissions, <b>he does not bring</b> an offering. |
| Leviticus 15:15 | offer | Yoma 41a:3 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> in one verse: <b>“And she shall take</b> two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering and the other for a sin-offering” (Leviticus 12:8). In another verse, it is also written: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>offer</b> them, the one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 15:15). The verses mention only the possibility of designating the offering <b>either upon taking</b> them <b>or upon</b> the <b>performance</b> of the sacrificial rite. |
| Leviticus 15:16 | the Merciful One states: “The flow of seed” | Avodah Zarah68b:15 | <b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> With regard to the ritual impurity of semen, <b>the Merciful One states: “The flow of seed”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), meaning that the reference is to semen that is <b>fit to fertilize. Here too,</b> with regard to the ritual impurity of a mouse, the verse states: <b>“When they have died”</b> (Leviticus 11:32). <b>The Merciful One states</b> that the carcasses of creeping animals impart impurity only when they are <b>similar to</b> their state at time of <b>their death,</b> i.e., when they are still moist. Therefore, there is no contradiction to the claim that the prohibition against eating a mouse is a novelty and consequently applies even when it detracted from the flavor of the food into which it fell. |
| Leviticus 15:16 | his flesh in water” | Bava Kamma82b:3 | The Gemara analyzes the last of the ten ordinances: <b>And he instituted</b> the requirement of <b>immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission.</b> The Gemara asks: But this <b>is</b> required <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe</b> all <b>his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 15:16). The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law</b> immersion <b>is</b> required only if one wishes to partake <b>of <i>teruma</i> or sacrificial</b> meat. Ezra <b>came</b> and further <b>instituted</b> that immersion is necessary <b>even for</b> reciting or studying <b>matters of Torah.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:16 | all his flesh | Chagigah 11a:12 | § The mishna further taught that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity</b> have something to support them. The Gemara again asks: But ritual purity <b>is written</b> explicitly in the Torah. The Gemara answers: The observation that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity merely have something to support them <b>is necessary only for</b> the minimum <b>measure of a ritual bath, which is not written</b> explicitly in the Torah. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall bathe his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). This means <b>in the water of a ritual bath.</b> And it is stated: “And he shall wash <b>all his flesh</b> in water” (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that it must contain <b>water in which his whole body can enter. And how much</b> water <b>is this? One cubit by one cubit with a height of three cubits. And the Sages estimated</b> that the measure for <b>ritual bath water</b> is <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:16 | “all his flesh” | Eruvin 14b:1 | <b>in water</b>; specifically <b>in the water of a ritual bath.</b> The expression <b>“all his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:16) teaches that one must immerse in <b>water that his whole body can enter</b> at once. <b>And how much is that? A cubit by a cubit by the height of three cubits. And the Sages calculated</b> that the volume of <b>water</b> necessary for <b>a ritual bath</b> of this size <b>is forty <i>se’a</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:16 | in the Torah, as it is written: “And he shall bathe all his flesh in the water” | Eruvin 4b:6 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said above that Rav said that the laws governing <b>interpositions</b> that invalidate ritual immersion are <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara challenges this assertion: These, too, <b>are</b> written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “And he shall bathe all his flesh in the water”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), and the Sages derived <b>that nothing should intervene between his flesh and the water.</b> The definite article in the phrase <b>“in the water”</b> indicates that this bathing is performed in water mentioned elsewhere, i.e., specifically <b>in the water of a ritual bath,</b> and not in just any water. And the phrase <b>“all his flesh”</b> indicates that it must be in <b>water into which all of his body can enter,</b> i.e., in which a person can immerse his entire body at once. <b>And how much</b> water <b>is that?</b> It is <b>a cubit by a cubit by the height of three cubits. And the Sages calculated</b> the volume of a ritual bath of this size and determined that <b>the waters of a ritual bath</b> measure <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b> As this is derived from the Written Torah, what need is there for a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? |
| Leviticus 15:16 | a one-day-old. But raise a contradiction | Niddah 32b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Apparently, when the verse includes</b> a minor boy it <b>includes</b> even <b>a one-day-old. But raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>, which addresses the verse: “And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:16). From the word <b>“man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is rendered ritually impure through a seminal emission. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the seminal emission of a boy <b>aged nine years and one day</b> renders him impure as well? <b>The verse states: “And a man.”</b> Evidently, the verse does not include a one-day-old boy. |
| Leviticus 15:16 | impure. What is the reason? The Merciful One states: “The flow of seed” | Niddah 43a:10 | <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> emission of <b>semen that is not felt by one’s entire body does not render</b> him <b>impure. What is the reason? The Merciful One states: “The flow of seed”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that it is referring to an emission <b>that is fit to fertilize,</b> i.e., it is referring only to the kind of emission which is felt as it exits the body. |
| Leviticus 15:16 | that it is written: “And if the flow of seed goes out from a man” | Niddah 43a:5 | § The mishna teaches that a woman becomes ritually impure with the flow of blood from the uterus into the vagina, even if it did not leave the woman’s body. <b>But the <i>zav</i> and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure</b> until their emission of impurity emerges outside the body. The Gemara explains: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “When</b> any man <b>has an issue out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse teaches that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>until his issue emerges out of his flesh.</b> With regard to <b>one who experiences a seminal emission,</b> the reason is <b>that it is written: “And if the flow of seed goes out from a man”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that the flow must exit his body. |
| Leviticus 15:16 | “And he shall bathe all his flesh in the water” | Pesachim 109a:7 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: The quarter</b>-<i>log</i> measurement <b>of the Torah is two fingerbreadths by two fingerbreadths</b> in volume, <b>by the height of two fingerbreadths and one half fingerbreadth and one-fifth of a fingerbreadth.</b> This statement is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a ritual bath, about which the verse states: <b>“And he shall bathe all his flesh in the water”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), from which the Sages expounded: This phrase teaches <b>that there should be nothing interposing between one’s flesh</b> and <b>the water.</b> The expression <b>“in the water”</b> indicates that the verse is referring to a specific body of water, i.e., <b>in the water of a ritual bath.</b> The phrase <b>“all his flesh”</b> teaches that one must immerse in <b>water that his whole body can enter</b> at once. <b>And how much is that?</b> |
| Leviticus 15:16 | written about that one, | Pesachim 67b:11 | The Gemara expresses surprise: Why did the mishna need to teach that they are comparable with regard to <b>their impurity? Impurity until evening is</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the Torah <b>about this one,</b> meaning that one who came into contact with a creeping animal is impure until the evening and then must undergo ritual immersion in order to become pure, as it states: “And for these you shall be unclean; whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until evening” (Leviticus 11:24). <b>And impurity until evening is</b> explicitly <b>written about that one,</b> one who experienced a seminal emission, as it states: “And if semen goes out from a man, then shall he bathe all his flesh in water and be unclean until evening” (Leviticus 15:16). <b>Rather, is it not</b> that they are compared with regard to <b>their camps,</b> which is not explicit in the Torah? |
| Leviticus 15:17 | and it is written with regard to semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it” | Bava Kamma25b:11 | The Gemara answers: The terms “garment” and “leather,” as stated <b>with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, are also free. Since</b> the impurity of <b>a corpse is juxtaposed with</b> that of <b>semen, as it is written: “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and it is written with regard to semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it”</b> (Leviticus 15:17), <b>why do I</b> need the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse? Learn from it</b> that they are mentioned in order <b>to render them free, and</b> therefore <b>it is free from both sides.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:17 | semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it | Bava Kamma25b:8 | The Gemara affirms: <b>Indeed,</b> the terms <b>are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms “garment” and “leather” are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“Or a man who touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5); <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it</b> shall be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17), since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other. |
| Leviticus 15:17 | semen: “And every garment and every hide on which the semen is | Shabbat 64a:17 | <b>Indeed [<i>la’ei</i>], they are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms garment and leather are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity from contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity from contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And whoever touches anything that is impure by the dead or a <b>man from whom semen is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> is the verse: <b>“Or whoever touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5). <b>And it is written</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of</b> the ritual impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and every hide on which the semen is</b> must be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17). Since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other. Consequently, the words <b>garment and leather, which the Torah wrote with regard to a creeping animal, why do I need</b> them? The relevant <i>halakha</i> could be derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of seminal impurity. <b>Learn from it</b> that garment and leather were mentioned <b>to render them free.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:17 | and it is stated with regard to semen: “And every garment and every hide” | Shabbat 64a:19 | The Gemara answers: Garment and leather stated <b>with regard to</b> impurity imparted by a <b>corpse are also free. Now, since a corpse is juxtaposed with semen, as it is written: “And whoever touches anything that is impure by the dead or a man whose semen is emitted from him”</b> (Leviticus 22:4); <b>and it is stated with regard to semen: “And every garment and every hide”</b> (Leviticus 15:17); the terms <b>garment and leather, which the Torah wrote with regard to</b> ritual impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, why do I</b> need them? <b>Learn from it</b> that they are mentioned in order <b>to render them free.</b> These terms are extraneous in their context, and were written for the purpose of the verbal analogy with the <i>halakhot</i> of creeping animals. |
| Leviticus 15:17 | “And every garment, and every hide on which there is semen | Shabbat 86b:3 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Abba, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: These are the statements of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. However, the Rabbis say: We require</b> that <b>six complete</b> twelve-hour <b>periods</b> elapse between cohabitation and discharge. If a woman discharged semen less than seventy-two hours after having relations, the semen renders her ritually impure. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> over how long semen renders one ritually impure is only with regard to semen that <b>is discharged from a woman; however,</b> if it <b>is discharged from a man,</b> e.g., it was on a garment, <b>it is impure as long as it is moist,</b> regardless of how much time passed since its discharge. <b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: <b>“And every garment, and every hide on which there is semen</b> shall be immersed in water, and be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17). And the Sages taught: This <b>excludes semen which is foul. What, is it not</b> referring to semen <b>discharged from a man,</b> indicating that even moist semen becomes foul after a certain period of time and no longer transmits impurity? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is referring to semen <b>that was discharged from a woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:18 | raise a contradiction | Niddah 32a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Apparently, when the verse includes</b> young girls through the word “and” it <b>includes</b> even <b>a one-day-old. But</b> you can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>, which discusses the verse: “And the woman with whom a man shall lie carnally, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:18). From the word <b>“woman” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the sexual intercourse of an adult <b>woman</b> is considered intercourse that renders her impure. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the <b>sexual intercourse of a girl aged three years and one day</b> is also classified as intercourse? <b>The verse states: And the woman.</b> Evidently, the word “and” includes only a girl aged three years and one day. |
| Leviticus 15:18 | they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening” | Niddah 41b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her? But isn’t it taught</b> to the contrary in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, <b>they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening”</b> (Leviticus 15:18). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: And what does this</b> verse <b>come to teach us? If</b> it teaches <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>comes into contact with semen</b> that they are impure, <b>it is already stated below</b> (Leviticus 22:4): <b>“Or a man</b> from whom the flow of seed goes out,” from which it is derived that coming into contact with semen renders one impure. |
| Leviticus 15:18 | “They shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening” | Niddah 42a:3 | <b>And</b> the statement of <b>Rava is referring to a verse</b> in the Torah, <b>and this</b> is what <b>he is saying: When the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah, with regard to a man and woman who engaged in intercourse: <b>“They shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening”</b> (Leviticus 15:18), which indicates that when evening comes the woman’s purification is complete, it is dealing with a case <b>where she</b> is in bed and <b>does not turn around</b> from side to side. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where she does turn around, she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> for <b>the entire three days</b> following the intercourse, <b>as it is impossible for her not to discharge</b> semen throughout this period. |
| Leviticus 15:18 | As it is taught | Niddah 42b:10 | <b>Abaye said: It is</b> considered <b>encapsulated. Rava said: It is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body. <b>Rava</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> this? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:18). Rabbi Shimon said: Now what does this verse teach? If it teaches that one who touches semen is rendered impure, this is derived from the verse: “Or a man from whom the flow of seed goes out” (Leviticus 22:4). <b>Rather,</b> it must be teaching that a woman who engages in intercourse is rendered impure by the man’s semen, despite the fact that the semen did not touch her on the outside of her body. |
| Leviticus 15:18 | with whom | Yevamot 34b:5 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And the woman, <b>with whom</b> a man shall lie giving seed, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening” (Leviticus 15:18). The extra term <b>“with whom”</b> comes <b>to exclude a bride</b> who does not become ritually impure; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: It excludes</b> the case of sexual intercourse performed <b>in an atypical manner. Hon, son of Rav Naḥman, said to Rav Naḥman: Shall we say that Rabbi Yehuda holds: The Torah spared a bride’s adornments,</b> including her make-up, and therefore exempted her from submersion in water, as that might cause them ruin? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> That is not the reason. Rather, <b>it is because a woman does not become pregnant from the first act of intercourse.</b> Therefore, that act of intercourse would not cause ritual impurity, as it is not considered intercourse that can result in the implanting of seed. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | in her flesh | Niddah 21b:16 | § <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who</b> inserted a tube into her vagina and <b>sees blood,</b> i.e., she found blood <b>in</b> the <b>tube, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya clarified his question: Since it is stated: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue <b>in her flesh</b> is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), perhaps <b>the Merciful One states</b> in this verse that the woman is impure only if the blood is discharged through “her flesh” <b>and not through a tube. Or perhaps this</b> term: <b>“In her flesh,”</b> is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a woman <b>becomes impure</b> by finding blood <b>inside</b> her vagina <b>just as</b> she becomes impure by experiencing bleeding <b>outside</b> her vagina, i.e., once the blood enters the vaginal canal from the uterus the woman is ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | as we interpret | Niddah 32a:11 | The Gemara explains: There is no need to be concerned with regard to <b>our</b> young girls, <b>as we interpret</b> the verse: “And if a woman has an issue” (Leviticus 15:19), and derive from the fact that the verse does not merely state: <b>“A woman,”</b> but: <b>“And</b> if <b>a woman,”</b> that even minor girls are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a menstruating woman. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>when</b> our girls <b>see</b> menstrual blood, <b>we separate them</b> in the manner of all menstruating women. Therefore, <b>the Sages did not decree with regard to them</b> that all young Jewish girls assume the status of menstruating women. By contrast, with regard to <b>them,</b> Samaritans, <b>who do not interpret</b> the difference between <b>“a woman”</b> and <b>“and</b> if <b>a woman,” when</b> their girls <b>see</b> menstrual blood <b>they do not separate them,</b> and therefore <b>the Sages decreed with regard to them</b> that all Samaritan girls assume the status of menstruating women. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | a menstruating woman as well, | Niddah 36b:17 | The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the above verse is interpreted in such a manner, then in the case <b>a menstruating woman as well,</b> with regard to whom the verse states: “And a woman, if she has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), <b>let us say</b> that when the verse states <b>“her issue”</b> this indicates that only <b>her issue</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> renders her a menstruating woman, <b>but not</b> an issue that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:19 | as it is stated: “And her issue in her flesh shall be blood, | Niddah 40a:2 | <b>All women become ritually impure</b> with the flow of blood from the uterus <b>into the outer chamber,</b> i.e., the vagina, although it did not leave the woman’s body, <b>as it is stated: “And her issue in her flesh shall be blood,</b> she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), indicating that even if her menstrual blood remains in her flesh, she becomes impure. <b>But one who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure until their</b> emission of <b>impurity emerges outside</b> the body. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | into the outer chamber, | Niddah 41b:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>All women become ritually impure</b> with the flow of blood from the uterus <b>into the outer chamber,</b> i.e., the vagina, as it is stated: “And her issue in her flesh shall be blood” (Leviticus 15:19). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> exactly <b>is the outer chamber? Reish Lakish says: Any</b> place <b>which can be seen when a little girl sits</b> with her legs spread. When the blood reaches that area in the vagina, the woman becomes ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | The Sages taught | Niddah 41b:14 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written concerning a menstruating woman: “And if a woman has an issue, and her flow in her flesh shall be blood, she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19). The term <b>“in her flesh” teaches that she becomes impure</b> while the blood is still <b>inside</b> her flesh just <b>as</b> when the blood emerges <b>outside</b> her body. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies in the case of <b>a menstruating woman. From where</b> is it derived that it applies to <b>a <i>zava</i></b> as well? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Her flow [<i>zovah</i>] in her flesh.”</b> |
| Leviticus 15:19 | “blood” | Niddah 41b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> kind of impurity is this woman subject in this situation? <b>If we say</b> that she is subject <b>to the impurity of seven</b> days of menstruating women, that is impossible, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that such impurity is caused by <b>“blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:19), <b>and not a piece</b> of flesh. <b>Rather,</b> she is subject <b>to impurity</b> that lasts until the <b>evening,</b> as a result of the surface of her body having come into contact with the uterus, which is a source of impurity. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | As the Sages taught | Niddah 44a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation apply even to a one-day-old baby girl, derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days” (Leviticus 15:19). When the verse states <b>“a woman,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation apply to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive that the impurity <b>of a menstruating woman</b> also applies to <b>a one-day-old</b> baby? <b>The verse states: “And a woman,”</b> to include even a baby girl. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | shall be | Niddah 54b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the impurity of the menstrual blood when it is <b>moist,</b> since it is called the menstrual flow; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>dry</b> menstrual blood also transmits impurity? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to menstrual impurity: “And if a woman should have an issue, and her issue in her flesh <b>shall be</b> blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days, and whoever touches her shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:19). The term “shall be” indicates that the blood <b>shall</b> remain <b>in its</b> impure <b>status</b> even once it is dry. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | in her flesh | Niddah 57b:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the cases discussed in the mishna concerning a blood stain found on a woman, <b>Shmuel says:</b> If a woman <b>examined the ground</b> beneath her to see if it was clean from blood and other substances, and she found nothing, <b>and</b> subsequently she <b>sat upon it and</b> then <b>found blood on it,</b> although it might be assumed that this blood came from her, <b>she is ritually pure.</b> The reason is <b>as it is stated:</b> “And her issue <b>in her flesh</b> shall be blood, she shall be in her menstrual state seven days” (Leviticus 15:19). This verse teaches that a woman does not become impure <b>unless she senses,</b> i.e., experiences some type of sensation, <b>in her flesh</b> that she emitted blood from her uterus. Since this woman did not sense an emission of blood, she is pure. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | to be lenient, as it is stated: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh shall be blood” | Niddah 58b:7 | Rabbi Akiva <b>saw his students looking at each other,</b> wondering why he ruled leniently in this case. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: What</b> in this <b>matter is difficult in your eyes?</b> The reason I ruled this way is <b>that the Sages did not state the matter</b> of the impurity of blood stains in order <b>to be stringent; rather,</b> they instituted this impurity in order <b>to be lenient, as it is stated: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh shall be blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:19), from which it is derived that by Torah law, <b>“blood”</b> deems her impure, <b>but not a stain.</b> Impurity from a blood stain was instituted by the Sages, and they rule leniently in any case where the stain can be attributed to another source. |
| Leviticus 15:19 | if a woman has a flow, and her flow on her flesh be blood, | Niddah 72b:19 | <b>And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: “And <b>if a woman has a flow, and her flow on her flesh be blood,</b> she shall be in her impurity seven days; and whoever touches her shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:19)? This is referring <b>to</b> one <b>who sees</b> blood on only <b>one day.</b> But perhaps one who sees blood for three days at the beginning of her days of menstruation should become a <i>zava</i>? <b>The verse states:</b> |
| Leviticus 15:19 | she shall be in her impurity seven days” | Pesachim 90b:26 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>I might</b> have thought that a menstruating woman or a woman after childbirth <b>should immerse while still day,</b> like others who are obligated to immerse. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a woman should have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, <b>she shall be in her impurity seven days”</b> (Leviticus 15:19), which indicates that <b>she shall be in her</b> state of <b>impurity</b> for a <b>full seven</b> days and doesn’t immerse until the night following the seventh day. <b>And</b> this is also true of <b>a woman after childbirth,</b> who <b>is compared</b> in the Torah <b>to a menstruating woman</b> in the verse “If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male, then she shall be unclean seven days, as in the days of her menstrual flow shall she be unclean” (Leviticus 12:2). |
| Leviticus 15:22 | riding. And | Pesachim 3a:12 | Likewise, a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: A person should always converse euphemistically, as</b> one finds in the following verses. The first: “And whichever saddle that the <i>zav</i> rides upon shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 15:9), which discusses the impurity imparted by <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to an object on which he sits, <b>calls</b> this action <b>riding. And</b> the verse: “And anyone who touches anything on which she sat” (Leviticus 15:22), which discusses the parallel ritual impurity <b>of a woman,</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>calls</b> the action <b>sitting.</b> Since riding is slightly demeaning for a woman, as it involves an immodest splaying of the legs, the verse avoids the term riding and opts to convey the more modest image of sitting. <b>And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“And you choose the language of the crafty”</b> (Job 15:5), meaning that one should be clever when speaking and avoid inappropriate phrases. <b>And it says</b> in another verse: “My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; <b>and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely”</b> (Job 33:3). |
| Leviticus 15:23 | upon which she sits, | Niddah 54b:19 | The Gemara replies that <b>from this</b> same derivation one can infer that menstrual blood does not render items designated for lying or sitting impure: <b>Didn’t you say</b> that the term “the <i>zav</i>” teaches that only <b>the <i>zav</i>, and not a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy, renders items designated for lying or sitting impure? <b>So too,</b> a verse excludes menstrual blood from this category of impurity, as <b>the verse states:</b> “And he if is on the bed, or on any item <b>upon which she sits,</b> when he touches it, he shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:23). The term “she” indicates that <b>she,</b> the menstruating woman, <b>but not her blood,</b> transmits impurity to items designated for lying or sitting. |
| Leviticus 15:24 | the verse states: “And her impurity be [ ut’hi ] upon him” | Kiddushin 68a:1 | then <b>even</b> if he betrothed <b>a menstruating woman as well,</b> his betrothal should not be effective and the offspring should be a <i>mamzer</i>, as a menstruating woman is included in the list in that chapter of those with whom sexual intercourse is forbidden. If so, <b>why</b> did <b>Abaye say: All concede with regard to one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a <i>sota</i>,</b> a woman forbidden to her husband on suspicion of being unfaithful to him, <b>that the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i>? Ḥizkiyya said:</b> In the case of a menstruating woman, <b>the verse states: “And her impurity be [<i>ut’hi</i>] upon him”</b> (Leviticus 15:24), from which it is derived that <b>even at the time of her impurity,</b> the type of <b>becoming [<i>havaya</i>]</b> stated with regard to betrothal (see Deuteronomy 24:2) <b>should</b> apply <b>to her.</b> The Gemara is interpreting the connection between the words <i>ut’hi</i> and <i>havaya</i>, as both share the same Hebrew root. |
| Leviticus 15:24 | and her impurity be upon him, | Niddah 33a:5 | § The mishna teaches that Samaritan men are considered men who engage in intercourse with menstruating women, and consequently they impart impurity to the bedding beneath them. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the bedding <b>beneath</b> one who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman</b> is impure? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a menstruating woman: “And if any man lie with her, <b>and her impurity be upon him,</b> he shall be impure seven days, and every bed upon which he lies shall be impure” (Leviticus 15:24). |
| Leviticus 15:24 | the verse states: “And every bed upon which he lies shall be impure” | Niddah 33a:8 | <b>If</b> so, i.e., that one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman is compared to the woman herself, then say: <b>Just as she renders</b> the <b>bedding</b> beneath her <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which she sits impure <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>the garments</b> he is wearing, <b>so too, he renders</b> the <b>bedding</b> beneath him <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which he sits impure <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>the garments</b> he is wearing. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And every bed upon which he lies shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:24). |
| Leviticus 15:24 | and her menstrual flow shall be upon him” | Shevuot 18b:5 | The Gemara explains the intent of the question of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosei ben Lakonya: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive the <b>prohibition with regard to</b> the case in the mishna concerning one who <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, that he must not withdraw immediately?</b> In response to this question <b>Ḥizkiyya said: The verse states:</b> “And if any man lies with her, <b>and her menstrual flow shall be upon him”</b> (Leviticus 15:24), teaching that <b>even</b> at any time <b>when she is menstruating,</b> the prohibition <b>shall be upon him;</b> therefore, he must not withdraw from her immediately. |
| Leviticus 15:24 | betrothal of her takes effect, as it is stated: “And her impurity shall be upon him” | Yevamot 49b:2 | With regard to <b>a menstruating woman</b> the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i> <b>because</b> one’s <b>betrothal of her takes effect, as it is stated: “And her impurity shall be upon him”</b> (Leviticus 15:24). The phrase “shall be” alludes to the fact that a betrothal with her takes effect. The verse teaches that <b>even at the time of her</b> menstrual <b>impurity, betrothal with her takes effect.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:25 | days | Bava Kamma24a:2 | Rabbi Meir <b>said to them:</b> The case of the <i>zava</i> does not disprove my opinion, because the verse <b>states</b> in reference to the parallel <i>halakha</i> of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]: <b>“And this shall be his ritual impurity when he has a discharge”</b> (Leviticus 15:3). The word “this” emphasizes that in this matter the <i>halakha</i> requires following the instructions of the verse precisely as they were recorded, and in this case <b>the verse associates</b> the impurity of <b>the <i>zav</i> with</b> the number of <b>sightings</b> of discharges the man observed, <b>and</b> it associates <b>the</b> impurity of the <b><i>zava</i> with</b> the number of <b>days</b> during which she experienced sightings of blood, as it says: “Many days” (Leviticus 15:25). By contrast, with regard to the goring ox, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference remains in place. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | Rav Naḥman says: Three, | Gittin 46a:9 | <b>Rav Naḥman says: Three,</b> and he derives this from a verse written with regard to a <i>zava</i>. The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood for many days [<i>yamim rabbim</i>]” (Leviticus 15:25). Rav Naḥman holds that <b>“days”</b> are a minimum of <b>two,</b> so the addition of the word <b>“many”</b> indicates that it means <b>three</b> days. Here too, where the mishna uses the term many [<i>rabbim</i>], it is a minimum of three people. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a vow taken in the presence of the public cannot be dissolved is referring to a vow taken in the presence of at least <b>ten</b> people, <b>as it is written</b> in the Torah portion discussing the people of Gibeon, which is the source for this <i>halakha</i>: “For the leaders of the <b>congregation</b> swore to them,” and a congregation consists of at least ten people, as is derived from the episode concerning the spies. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | “many | Ketubot 75a:1 | <b>“And the children of Israel did not smite them, for the princes of the assembly had sworn to them”</b> (Joshua 9:18), and since this oath was uttered in the presence of many people, it could not be rescinded, although it was undertaken in error because the Gibeonites had deceived the people of Israel. The Gemara poses a question: <b>And how many</b> people are considered <b>many</b> for the purposes of this law? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Three,</b> as can be learned from the laws of a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>]: <b>“Days”</b> indicates <b>two,</b> which is the minimal number justifying use of the plural noun. The term <b>“many</b> days” (Leviticus 15:25) therefore indicates a total of <b>three. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Ten, as</b> the term <b>“assembly” is written in relation to the</b> Gibeonites, and it is taught elsewhere that an assembly is comprised of at least ten members. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | has a flow of her blood | Niddah 22a:12 | § <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, asked Rabbi Elazar:</b> If a woman discharges <b>dry blood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does she have the status of a menstruating woman? The Gemara explains the dilemma: Since <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And <b>if</b> a woman <b>has a flow of her blood</b> many days” (Leviticus 15:25), does this indicate <b>that</b> the woman is not impure <b>unless</b> the blood <b>flows,</b> i.e., if it is <b>wet, yes,</b> she is impure, whereas if it is <b>dry</b> she is <b>not</b> impure? <b>Or perhaps this</b> phrase: <b>“If</b> a woman <b>has a flow of her blood,” is</b> merely referring to <b>the normal manner</b> that menstrual blood emerges, <b>but actually even dry</b> blood renders the woman impure. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | that which is taught | Niddah 32b:2 | The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>]: The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25). From the word <b>“woman” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <i>ziva</i> applies to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive <b>that a ten-day-old</b> girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>ziva</i>? The verse states: “And</b> if <b>a woman.” Why do I</b> need the verse? <b>Let one derive</b> that a ten-day-old girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> <b>from</b> the fact that a one-day-old girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> as a woman may become a <i>zava</i> only after seven days of menstruation and three subsequent days of experiencing uterine discharge. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | As the Sages taught | Niddah 36b:12 | § The mishna teaches that if a woman experiences bleeding due to labor pains during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> she is not considered a <i>zava</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a <i>zava</i>: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25). The term <b>“her blood”</b> indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure as blood of <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:25 | “her blood” | Niddah 36b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>And now that it is written: “And she shall be impure two weeks as in her menstruation,” why do I</b> need the term <b>“her blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:25) from which it is likewise derived that blood emitted due to labor pains during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is pure? The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the term <b>“her blood,” I would say</b> the verse is teaching that a woman who gives birth is impure <b>as in her menstruation, and not as in her <i>ziva</i>, and</b> therefore, <b>even</b> if she experienced bleeding during her days of <i>ziva</i> <b>in</b> a state of <b>resting</b> from labor pains, she remains pure. Consequently, the term “her blood” <b>teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only if she experiences bleeding due to labor pains. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | her blood many days | Niddah 38a:5 | Some Sages <b>state another version</b> of the above disagreement: <b>Rabbi Levi says: The</b> birth of <b>a child renders</b> the mother <b>ritually pure only</b> if she experienced bleeding during the eleven <b>days that are fit</b> for her <b>to become a greater <i>zava</i>,</b> i.e., if she experienced bleeding on three consecutive days during that time. But if she experienced bleeding on only one or two days she is rendered a lesser <i>zava</i>, and she must observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge. <b>What is the reason?</b> It <b>is written:</b> “And if a woman has an issue of <b>her blood many days</b>…all the days of the issue of her impurity she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). The verse is referring specifically to a greater <i>zava</i>, indicating that the <i>halakha</i> that a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of an emission of blood caused by labor pains applies only to a greater <i>zava</i>. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | Rabbi Eliezer triumphed over the Rabbis: Didn’t you say | Niddah 38b:17 | <b>Rava said: With this</b> response <b>Rabbi Eliezer triumphed over the Rabbis: Didn’t you say</b> that the reason why a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of blood that is emitted due to labor pains before birth is because the verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25)? The term <b>“her blood”</b> indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure due to <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child. So too,</b> one can say that as the verse states with regard to a woman who gives birth: <b>“And she shall be purified from the fountain of her blood”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), this indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is pure from <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:25 | As the Sages taught | Niddah 44a:3 | The mishna further teaches that a baby girl who is <b>ten days old</b> who experiences an emission of blood for three consecutive days after the conclusion of the seven days fit for menstruation, becomes impure with the impurity <b>of <i>ziva</i>.</b> Again, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her menstruation…she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). When the verse states <b>“a woman,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zava</i> apply to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive that the impurity <b>of <i>ziva</i></b> also applies to <b>a ten-day-old</b> baby? <b>The verse states: “And a woman,”</b> to include even a baby girl. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | not in the time of her menstruation, | Niddah 73a:1 | “And if a woman has a discharge of her <i>ziva</i> blood for many days <b>not in the time of her menstruation,</b> or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her menstruation, all the days of the issue of her <i>ziva</i> she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). This verse teaches that a woman becomes a <i>zava</i> only if she experiences bleeding <b>close to</b> her days of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., on the day following her days of menstruation, but not during her days of menstruation. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | said to him: With regard to your claim, the verse states: “Beyond the time of her menstruation” | Niddah 73a:14 | With regard to the verse discussing the days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>Rav Shemaya said to Rabbi Abba:</b> But one can <b>say</b> that if she experiences bleeding <b>during the daytime she shall be a <i>zava</i>,</b> but if she experiences bleeding <b>at night she shall be a menstruating woman,</b> as the verse specifies “days.” Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: With regard to your claim, the verse states: “Beyond the time of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:25), which teaches that she becomes a <i>zava</i> if she experiences bleeding <b>close to her</b> days of <b>menstruation. When is</b> the time <b>close to her</b> days of <b>menstruation? At night. And</b> with regard to an emission during this time <b>the</b> verse <b>calls her a <i>zava</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:25 | The verse states: “Or if she has a discharge | Niddah 73a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that she is a <i>zava</i> in a case where she experiences bleeding <b>close to</b> her time of <b>menstruation. From where</b> do I derive that if she experiences bleeding <b>one day separated from</b> her days of <b>menstruation</b> she is also a <i>zava</i>? <b>The verse states: “Or if she has a discharge</b> beyond the time of her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:25). |
| Leviticus 15:25 | The verse states: “Not in the time of her menstruation” | Niddah 73a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> a case where she experiences bleeding on the <b>eleventh</b> day after her days of menstruation? <b>The verse states: “Not in the time of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:25). One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include even</b> the <b>twelfth</b> day after her period of menstruation. <b>You</b> must <b>say: No,</b> as that is no longer within her days of <i>ziva</i>. |
| Leviticus 15:25 | “Or if she has a discharge | Niddah 73a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And what did you see to include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day <b>and to exclude</b> the <b>twelfth</b> day? <b>I include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day <b>as it is fit for counting</b> the seven clean days that follow sightings on three consecutive days which ended on the fourth day, as derived from the verse: <b>“Or if she has a discharge</b> beyond the time of her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:25), as explained; <b>and I exclude</b> the <b>twelfth</b> day <b>as it is not fit for counting</b> the seven clean days after the fourth day, a requirement derived from the same verse: <b>“Or if she has a discharge</b> beyond the time of her menstruation.” |
| Leviticus 15:25 | days | Niddah 73a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a woman is impure as a <i>zava</i> if she experiences bleeding for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days. From where</b> do I derive that she is impure if she experiences bleeding for <b>two</b> consecutive <b>days?</b> The continuation of <b>the verse states:</b> “All the <b>days</b> of the issue of her <i>ziva</i> she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). The plural “days” indicates two days. <b>From where</b> is it derived that she is impure if she experiences bleeding on only <b>one day? The verse states: “All the days</b> of the issue of her <i>ziva</i> she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure.” |
| Leviticus 15:26 | as it is written: “All the days of her discharge” | Horayot 4a:17 | The Gemara says: <b>Rather, actually,</b> the reference is to a ruling permitting the initial stage of intercourse <b>in a typical manner, and</b> the judges <b>said:</b> In the case of the prohibition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse, it is with regard to an afflicted woman,</b> who experienced the discharge of blood during her menstrual period, <b>that it is written,</b> not with regard to one who experiences the discharge during the eleven days between the end of one menstrual period and the expected start of another. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that they said:</b> A woman assumes the status of <b>a <i>zava</i>,</b> i.e., one who experiences a discharge of blood for three consecutive days during those eleven days, <b>only</b> if she experienced the discharge <b>during the day,</b> not at night, <b>as it is written: “All the days of her discharge”</b> (Leviticus 15:26). |
| Leviticus 15:26 | as it is written: “All the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her menstruation” | Megillah 20a:13 | <b>And</b> although <b>this one,</b> i.e., a woman who observes a day for a day, <b>cannot immerse on the</b> same <b>day</b> that she experienced the bleeding, <b>as it is written: “All the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:26), which teaches that she remains the entire day of her issue in her impure state and must wait until the day is over before she can immerse herself, nevertheless, one might have said that <b>at least during the night</b> following the day of her issue <b>she should</b> be able to <b>perform a partial observation,</b> i.e., she should verify that part of the night has gone by without bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>immerse herself</b> at night, without waiting until morning. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>since she is required to count</b> one day of purity after her day of impurity, |
| Leviticus 15:26 | like the bed of her menstruation; | Niddah 73a:10 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a <i>zava</i> <b>transmits impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting? The verse states:</b> “Every bed which she lies on all the days of her discharge shall be for her <b>like the bed of her menstruation;</b> and everything that she sits on shall be impure, as the impurity of her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:26). |
| Leviticus 15:26 | shall be for her like the bed of her menstrual period” | Shabbat 84a:5 | Similarly, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the verse states: “Every bed on which she lies all the days of her <i>zava</i> emission <b>shall be for her like the bed of her menstrual period”</b> (Leviticus 15:26). The verse <b>juxtaposes her bed to herself: Just as she has</b> the possibility of <b>purification in a ritual bath, so too, her bed</b> is referring to a vessel that <b>has</b> the possibility of <b>purification in a ritual bath.</b> This is <b>to the exclusion of an earthenware vessel, which does not have</b> the possibility of <b>purification in a ritual bath. Rabbi Ila strongly objects</b> to this from what we learned: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a</b> reed <b>mat</b> becomes ritually impure <b>from</b> contact with <b>a corpse?</b> |
| Leviticus 15:28 | “And she shall count for herself” | Horayot 4a:13 | The Gemara cites proof against the statement of Rav Yehuda, citing Shmuel. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: The judges are liable if they said: <b>There is</b> a prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who engages in intercourse with</b> a woman <b>who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> should they be liable in that case? The <i>halakha</i> of a woman <b>who observes a day for a day</b> that she experiences a discharge <b>is written</b> in the Torah with regard to a woman who experiences a discharge of blood during the eleven-day interval between menstrual periods: <b>“And she shall count for herself”</b> (Leviticus 15:28); this <b>teaches that she counts one</b> clean day <b>for one</b> day that she experiences a discharge. Since it is written in the Torah, even the Sadducees would agree. |
| Leviticus 15:28 | As it is stated: “Then she shall count to herself seven days” | Ketubot 72a:12 | § The mishna stated: <b>Or she engages in sexual intercourse with him</b> while she has the status of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If he knows about her</b> that she is a menstruating woman, <b>he should abstain.</b> And <b>if he does not know,</b> then <b>he should rely on her. Because Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a menstruating woman can count</b> the days <b>for herself,</b> and that she is trusted to testify that she did so? <b>As it is stated: “Then she shall count to herself seven days”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). <b>“To herself”</b> means <b>by herself,</b> and she may be trusted that she did so. If so, why can’t the husband trust his wife that she is not a menstruating woman? |
| Leviticus 15:28 | during the day | Megillah 20b:1 | and <b>counting</b> can only be done <b>during the day</b> and not at night, as it says: “And she shall count for herself seven days” (Leviticus 15:28), she cannot immerse herself until after sunrise, although here she has to count only one day. |
| Leviticus 15:28 | and after that she shall be pure” | Niddah 33b:3 | And if one suggests that <b>she should negate one day</b> alone, this too is untenable, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “But if she is purified from her <i>ziva</i> then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The word <b>“after”</b> indicates that she shall be pure only <b>after all of them,</b> i.e., after seven consecutive clean days, such <b>that there should be no impurity separating between them.</b> If so, there cannot be a situation where a <i>zava</i> negates a single day, and consequently it cannot be that a <i>zava</i> who discharges semen negates any part of her count. |
| Leviticus 15:28 | and after that she shall be pure” | Niddah 37a:15 | <b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that the birth is counted toward the seven days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she is purified from her <i>ziva</i> then she shall count for herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The word <b>“after”</b> indicates that she shall be pure only <b>after</b> counting <b>all of them,</b> i.e., <b>that there should not be an impurity separating between</b> any of the seven clean days. |
| Leviticus 15:28 | from her ziva | Niddah 37a:17 | <b>Rava</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> that the birth is counted toward the seven clean days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she is purified <b>from her <i>ziva</i></b> then she shall count for herself seven days” (Leviticus 15:28). This indicates that she counts seven clean days <b>from her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy,</b> i.e., she begins counting seven days from the cessation of her <i>ziva</i>, even if she is a leper. Likewise, she counts seven clean days <b>from her <i>ziva</i> and not from her</b> giving <b>birth,</b> as she counts seven clean days even if they continue through her days of impurity. The Gemara notes: <b>And Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> From this verse <b>teach one</b> derivation, i.e., <b>from her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy, but do not teach:</b> From her <i>ziva</i> <b>and not from her</b> giving <b>birth.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:28 | and after that she shall be pure” | Niddah 67b:9 | Rava and Abaye replied that they may nevertheless not immerse on the seventh day, <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she be purified of her <i>ziva</i>, then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The purification of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>after</b> the seven days, i.e., <b>after all of the</b> days, which must be consecutive so <b>that there are no</b> days of <b>impurity separating between</b> the seven clean days. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the phrase <b>“And after that she shall be pure”</b> teaches that <b>after the action</b> of counting seven clean days <b>she shall be pure.</b> In other words, once she has examined herself at the beginning of the seventh day she may immerse on that day. |
| Leviticus 15:28 | and after that she shall be pure” | Niddah 68b:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: According to your statement,</b> that the first day is included in her count of seven, <b>you are counting at intervals,</b> i.e., with days in-between that do not count, <b>and the Torah states:</b> “But if she be purified of her <i>ziva</i>, then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). This teaches that the purification of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>after</b> the seven days, i.e., <b>after all of the</b> days, which must be consecutive so <b>that there are no days of impurity separating between</b> the seven clean days. |
| Leviticus 15:30 | “And the priest shall sacrifice | Keritot 28a:10 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> with regard to the offering of a woman after childbirth: <b>“And she shall purchase two doves</b> or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). And with regard to the offering of a leper it is written: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice</b> the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering” (Leviticus 15:30). Together, these verses indicate that one bird is designated as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering <b>either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:31 | “Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity” | Moed Katan5a:21 | <b>Mar Zutra said</b> that an allusion to this obligation is found in the verse <b>“Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:31), which indicates that people must be warned to stay away from that which could cause them to become ritually impure. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall keep My charge”</b> (Leviticus 18:30), which means that you must <b>establish a safeguard for My charge,</b> i.e., protective measures must be enacted to prevent people from transgressing <i>halakha</i>, a task that includes distancing people from ritual impurity by marking off graves, so that they not come to convey ritual impurity to <i>teruma</i> or other consecrated items. |
| Leviticus 15:31 | “You shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity” | Niddah 63b:18 | <b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rava</b> actually <b>say this? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a menstruating woman: <b>“You shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:31). <b>From here, Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that there is <b>a warning to the children of Israel that they should separate from their wives close to</b> the time of <b>their</b> menstrual <b>cycles.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:31 | “And shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness” | Shevuot 18b:7 | § Having mentioned that it is prohibited for a man to engage in intercourse with a woman near the expected date of her menstruation, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse with regard to a menstruating woman states: <b>“And shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness”</b> (Leviticus 15:31), <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: From here</b> we derive <b>a prohibition to the children of Israel that they must separate from their wives near the expected date of</b> their menstruation. <b>And how long</b> before must they separate? <b>Rabba says: A set interval of time</b> for the ritual impurity of a menstruating woman, which is half of a twenty-four hour day, either the daytime or the nighttime. |
| Leviticus 15:32 | And the first emission of a zav is likened to one who experienced a seminal discharge, as it is written: “This is the halakha of him that has an issue and of him whose semen goes from him” | Megillah 20a:12 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to mention separately the case of a woman who observes a day for a day. As, <b>it might enter your mind to say that</b> this woman’s bleeding <b>should be treated like the first emission of a <i>zav</i>,</b> a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like secretion, in that just as a man attains the status of a full-fledged <i>zav</i> once he has three such emissions, so too, a woman attains the status of a full-fledged <i>zava</i> once she experiences three days of bleeding. <b>And the first emission of a <i>zav</i> is likened to one who experienced a seminal discharge, as it is written: “This is the <i>halakha</i> of him that has an issue and of him whose semen goes from him”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). From this it is learned: <b>Just as one who experienced a seminal discharge immerses on the</b> same <b>day</b> that he had the discharge, <b>so too, that one,</b> the <i>zav</i>, <b>may immerse himself on the</b> same <b>day</b> that he had the emission. |
| Leviticus 15:32 | as it is stated: “This is the law of the zav ” | Nedarim 35b:4 | The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that the mishna holds that priests are agents of Heaven, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> in general: <b>He sacrifices for him offerings.</b> Why did the mishna list these particular offerings? <b>Rather,</b> perforce, offerings brought by <b>those lacking atonement are different</b> from other offerings, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>requires knowledge</b> and intent in order to bring the offering, <b>except for those lacking atonement,</b> who bring the offering in order to complete their purification. This can be proven from the fact <b>that a person brings</b> a purification <b>offering for his minor sons and daughters,</b> although they lack halakhic intelligence, <b>as it is stated: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). This apparently superfluous verse comes to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>zav</i> apply to <b>both an adult and a minor.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:32 | “This is the law of the zav , and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges” | Niddah 22a:7 | If so, <b>why is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse’s juxtaposition between a <i>zav</i> and one who experienced a seminal emission: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count. If it is not the emission itself that renders the man impure but only his contact with the semen, why does the emission negate the count of seven clean days? |
| Leviticus 15:32 | “This is the law of the zav , | Niddah 22a:9 | Rabba further objected: <b>If that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> clean days, just like an emission of <i>ziva</i>, not merely the day on which the seminal emission occurred. But then <b>why is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,</b> and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges, so that he is impure by it” (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count. |
| Leviticus 15:32 | But | Niddah 33a:23 | The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a seminal emission negates a day from the count of a <i>zav</i> is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out, so that he is impure thereby” (Leviticus 15:32). Is it right that one <b>will stand and say about the verse</b> that <b>when it is written, it is written</b> specifically with regard to a seminal emission that occurs <b>adjacent to sunset?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Yes, perforce you must leave</b> aside the plain meaning <b>of</b> this <b>verse, as it compels itself to be established</b> as referring to such limited circumstances because it must conform to the principle that the halakhic status of part of the day is like that of an entire day. |
| Leviticus 15:32 | “This is the law of the zav , | Niddah 34b:13 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Beit Shammai</b> could <b>say to you: That</b> phrase <b>“whether it be a male” is necessary to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>, that the phrase <b>“whether it be a male”</b> serves to include <b>anyone who is a male, whether an adult or a minor,</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i>. <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> respond? <b>They derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the following verse: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,</b> and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out, so that he is unclean through it” (Leviticus 15:32). The verse indicates that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply to any male, <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult or whether</b> he is <b>a minor.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:32 | the Merciful One states: “This is the law of the zav , and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out” | Niddah 34b:14 | § The Gemara mentioned earlier that a minor is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i>. In this regard <b>Rav Yosef says: When Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish taught</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of a <i>zav</i>, he raised this dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>of a <i>zav</i></b> who is a <b>minor, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as to</b> whether <b>it imparts impurity through contact?</b> Does one say that as <b>the Merciful One states: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), one’s <i>ziva</i> is thereby compared to his semen? |
| Leviticus 15:32 | “This is the law of the zav ” | Niddah 35a:4 | With regard to the dilemma raised by Rav Yosef about the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> of a leper, <b>Abaye said: What</b> is the reason <b>he raises</b> such <b>a dilemma? But it was he who said</b> that when the verse states: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), it thereby teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor. And since he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from there,</b> the verse: “And of them that have an issue [<i>vehazav</i>] of <i>ziva</i>, whether it be a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33), <b>remains</b> available <b>for him</b> to derive as follows: <b>“Whether it be a male”</b> serves <b>to include a male leper</b> with regard <b>to his sources</b> of bodily emissions, and “or <b>a female”</b> serves <b>to include a female leper</b> with regard <b>to her sources</b> of bodily emissions. |
| Leviticus 15:32 | control, as it is stated: “This is the law of the zav , and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out” | Niddah 35a:6 | § <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity</b> to one who comes into contact with it, even if the emission occurred <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control, as it is stated: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). The verse compares the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> to a seminal emission: <b>Just as semen imparts impurity</b> even if it occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control, so too,</b> the <b>first sighting of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity</b> even if it occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:32 | so that he is thereby impure” | Niddah 68b:18 | <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond to Rabbi Yehoshua’s claim? He would say: <b>Granted, there</b> in the cases of the <i>zav</i> and the nazirite, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “This is the law of him that has an issue, and of him from whom an emission of semen goes out, <b>so that he is thereby impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). This teaches <b>that</b> when a <i>zav</i> experiences a seminal emission it <b>overturns</b> the counting of <b>only that</b> one <b>day. And if</b> one would claim that the Sages should issue a decree <b>due to</b> the concern that one might <b>confuse</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who had an emission of <i>ziva</i> during the seven clean days with a <i>zav</i> who had a seminal emission during the seven clean days, that is not a concern. The reason is that an emission of a <b><i>ziva</i></b> will <b>not be confused with</b> the case of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:33 | states: “And of them that have an issue, whether it be a male or a female” | Arakhin 3a:5 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that this amplification <b>is not necessary,</b> as the verse <b>states: “And of them that have an issue, whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“A male”</b> includes <b>anyone who is male, whether a small child or an adult; “a female”</b> includes <b>anyone who is female, whether a small child or an adult. If so, why</b> does <b>the verse state: “Any man”? The Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> i.e., this is a normal way to phrase the sentence, and therefore one should not derive a <i>halakha</i> from the extra word. |
| Leviticus 15:33 | “And one who has a discharge, whether it be a man or a woman” | Bava Kamma24a:3 | The Gemara asks about this interpretation: <b>From where</b> is it determined <b>that this</b> additional phrase: <b>“And this,”</b> serves <b>to exclude a <i>zava</i> from</b> having her status determined by individual <b>sightings</b> of blood, associating it instead with the number of days on which she experienced bleeding? <b>Say</b> instead that it serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b><i>zav</i> from</b> having his status determined by sightings on separate <b>days,</b> indicating that he will be rendered a <i>zav</i> only if he experienced three discharges on a single day and not on separate days. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> elsewhere: <b>“And one who has a discharge, whether it be a man or a woman”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the ritual impurity of <b>a male to</b> that of <b>a female</b> to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>female’s</b> ritual impurity is caused by sightings on multiple <b>days, so too</b> the ritual impurity of <b>a male</b> can be caused by sightings on multiple <b>days.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:33 | that the bird sin-offering that comes due to uncertainty is not eaten? The verse states: “And they who have an issue, whether a male or a female” | Nazir 29a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold this</b> opinion? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the bird sin-offering that comes due to uncertainty is not eaten? The verse states: “And they who have an issue, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), which <b>juxtaposes a female to a male: Just as a male brings an offering for a definite</b> sin, i.e., for a transgression he is sure he committed inadvertently, <b>so too, a female brings an offering for a definite</b> sin. <b>And just as a male brings</b> a provisional guilt-offering <b>for</b> his <b>uncertain</b> transgression, <b>so too, a female brings</b> an offering <b>for</b> her case of <b>uncertainty.</b> |
| Leviticus 15:33 | the verse states: “And the zav who has an issue [ zav et zovo ], | Nazir 65b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that one examines a <i>zav</i> before he has been confirmed as having a <i>ziva</i>, but not after? <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> that <b>the verse states: “And the <i>zav</i> who has an issue [<i>zav et zovo</i>],</b> whether it is a man or a woman” (Leviticus 15:33). This teaches that after two discharges, corresponding to the words <i>zav</i> and <i>zovo</i>, with regard <b>to the third sighting,</b> when one is already a <i>zav</i>, the verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a male to that <b>of a female:</b> Just as it makes no difference in the case of a female whether her discharge of menstrual blood was triggered by an external factor, as she is ritually impure regardless, once a male <i>zav</i> has the status of impurity, one no longer examines him to see if his discharge was triggered by an external factor. |
| Leviticus 15:33 | whether it be a male or a female” | Niddah 32b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> This derivation <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And of them that have an issue, <b>whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“Whether it be a male”</b> includes <b>anyone who is a male, whether he is an adult</b> or <b>whether he is a minor; “or a female”</b> includes <b>anyone who is a female, whether</b> she is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>a minor.

| Leviticus 15:33 | Rabbi Yitzḥak says: | Niddah 34b:6 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>blood</b> discharged <b>by</b> a female Jewish <b>leper</b> during the days <b>of purity</b> of a woman who gives birth, <b>Beit Shammai</b> deem it ritually pure and Beit Hillel say it imparts impurity only while moist. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Beit Hillel,</b> i.e., from where is their opinion derived? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse states at the conclusion of the passage discussing impure individuals: “Whether it be a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“Whether it be a male”</b> serves <b>to include the sources</b> of bodily emissions <b>of a male leper,</b> teaching that they also impart impurity. Likewise, the phrase <b>“or a female”</b> serves <b>to include the sources</b> of bodily emissions <b>of a female leper,</b> teaching that they too impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 15:33 | “ et ” | Niddah 35a:11 | The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is not the proper explanation of the mishna. Rather, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the examination serves <b>to</b> exempt him from bringing <b>an offering. And here they disagree with regard to</b> whether one interprets instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> in a verse. With regard to a <i>zav</i>, the verse states: “And of them that have an issue of <i>ziva</i> [<i>vehazav et zovo</i>], whether it be a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33). <b>The Rabbis do not interpret</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>,” and Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>.”</b> |
| Leviticus 15:33 | from there, | Niddah 35a:4 | With regard to the dilemma raised by Rav Yosef about the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> of a leper, <b>Abaye said: What</b> is the reason <b>he raises</b> such <b>a dilemma? But it was he who said</b> that when the verse states: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), it thereby teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor.

| Leviticus 15:33 | states: “And of those who have an issue, whether it be a male or a female” | Niddah 44a:5 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that this derivation <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “And of those who have an issue, whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). The phrase <b>“whether it be a male”</b> includes <b>anyone</b> who is a male, <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor; “or a female”</b> includes <b>anyone</b> who is a female, <b>whether</b> she is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>a minor.

| Leviticus 15:33 | of one who emits his issue” | Niddah 55b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have derived</b> the impurity of the discharge of a <i>zav</i> <b>from</b> the verse: “And <b>of one who emits his issue”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2)? |
| Leviticus 15:33 | of one who emits his issue [ zovo ], | Niddah 55b:4 | <b>Rav Yehuda of Diskarta said:</b> This verse <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the case of the <b>scapegoat may prove</b> that the discharge of a <i>zav</i> is not impure, <b>as</b> the scapegoat <b>causes impurity to others and</b> yet the goat <b>itself is pure.</b> Likewise, one might conclude that although the discharge of a <i>zav</i> causes impurity to others, <i>ziva</i> itself is pure. <b>And if</b> one were to dismiss this possibility, <b>due to</b> the verse: “And <b>of one who emits his issue [<i>zovo</i>],</b> in the case of a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33), one could reply <b>that</b> it does not indicate the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. Rather, <b>it comes to</b> teach the <b>number</b> of emissions by which one becomes impure with the impurity of a <i>zav</i>. |
| Leviticus 15:33 | “And of her that is sick in her menstrual status [ niddata ]” | Shabbat 64b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav, what is different</b> about <b>these,</b> the woolen cap and the wig, that the mishna permitted going out into the courtyard with them? <b>Ulla said: So that she will not become unappealing to her husband.</b> That would be the result if all ornamentation was prohibited. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And of her that is sick in her menstrual status [<i>niddata</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), <b>the Elders</b> of the <b>early</b> generations <b>said</b> that this verse comes to teach us that the menstruating woman should be distanced from her husband in all senses, like a person ostracized [<i>menudeh</i>] by the Sages. This includes <b>that she may not paint</b> her eyes <b>blue</b>, <b>and she may not rouge [<i>pokeset</i>]</b> her face, <b>and she may not adorn herself with colorful clothing. Until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: If</b> you do <b>so, you are making her unappealing to her husband, and her husband will</b> consequently <b>divorce her.</b> Therefore, extreme strictures should not be instituted. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of that which <b>the verse states: “And of her that is sick in her menstrual status”?

| Leviticus 16:1 | “After the death” | Megillah 24a:5 | § We learned further in the mishna: <b>One may skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Torah.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 68b): On Yom Kippur, the High Priest <b>reads</b> the section beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), and then he reads the section beginning with the verse: <b>“Only on the tenth day”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). <b>Doesn’t he skip</b> from the first section to the second section? |
| Leviticus 16:1 | near it: “After the death of | Shevuot 18b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who does not separate from his wife near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, <b>even</b> if <b>he has sons</b> who are fit to be great and holy <b>like the sons of Aaron,</b> these sons <b>will die</b> due to his sin, <b>as it is written: “And shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness…</b>this is the law…<b>of her that is sick with her menstrual flow”</b> (Leviticus 15:31–33), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “After the death of</b> the two sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 16:1). |
| Leviticus 16:1 | “After the death” | Sotah 41a:2 | § It is taught in the mishna that the High Priest receives the Torah scroll <b>and reads</b> the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26). Since these two portions are not adjacent to each other, the High Priest skips the section between the two portions. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 24a): <b>One may skip</b> sections when reading the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:1 | the verse states: “After the deaths of the two sons of Aaron” | Yoma 53a:18 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both</b> verses <b>were said before the deaths of Aaron’s sons,</b> who died upon entering the sacred place. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After the deaths of the two sons of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 16:1). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both of them,</b> the punishment and the warning, <b>were said after the deaths of Aaron’s two sons.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover</b>.” <b>How so;</b> how should these verses be understood? The <b>warning</b> was said <b>before</b> the <b>death</b> of Aaron’s sons, <b>and the punishment</b> associated with it was stated <b>after the death</b> of his sons. |
| Leviticus 16:1 | “After the death” | Yoma 68b:13 | <b>The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scroll and gives it to the head of the synagogue</b> that stood on the Temple Mount; <b>and the head of the synagogue gives it to the deputy</b> High Priest, <b>and the Deputy gives it to the High Priest, and the High Priest stands and receives</b> the scroll from his hands. <b>And he reads</b> from the scroll the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1) <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26), <b>and furls the Torah scroll and places it on his bosom and says: More than what I have read before you is written here.</b> The Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“And on the tenth,” from the book of Numbers</b> (29:7), <b>he</b> then <b>reads by heart.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:1 | “After the death” | Yoma 69b:17 | § It was taught in the mishna: <b>And he reads</b> from the scroll the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26). Although both of these portions appear in the book of Leviticus, they are not adjacent to one another. Perforce, the High Priest skipped the sections in between the two portions. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> It is taught in a mishna in tractate <i>Megilla</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>skip</b> sections when reading the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the Prophets, but one</b> may <b>not skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:2 | this verse: “And the Lord said to Moses: Speak to Aaron your brother, that he not come at all times into the holy place, within the Curtain, before the Ark Cover which is upon the Ark, that he not die” | Menachot 27b:7 | <b>With regard to what</b> issue <b>do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the proper understanding of <b>this verse: “And the Lord said to Moses: Speak to Aaron your brother, that he not come at all times into the holy place, within the Curtain, before the Ark Cover which is upon the Ark, that he not die”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that entering <b>into the holy place,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, is <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of: <b>He shall not come,</b> and one who violates it is punished with lashes, whereas entering <b>within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies <b>and before the Ark Cover</b> is <b>subject to</b> the warning of: <b>He shall not die,</b> and entering there is punished by death at the hand of Heaven. |
| Leviticus 16:2 | It is written here: “Before [ penei ] the Ark cover” | Sukkah 5b:1 | <b>of</b> a bird called <b><i>bar Yokhani</i>,</b> whose face is significantly larger than a handbreadth? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If you grasped many, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped something.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say that it is like the face of a bird, which is extremely small? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Rav Huna derives</b> that the thickness of the Ark cover was one handbreadth not through an actual comparison to the real faces of different creatures but rather by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b><i>penei</i></b> and <b><i>penei</i></b> written in different places in the Torah. <b>It is written here: “Before [<i>penei</i>] the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2), <b>and it is written there: “From the presence of [<i>penei</i>] Isaac his father”</b> (Genesis 27:30). The dimension of the Ark cover is like that of the face of a person, a handbreadth. |
| Leviticus 16:2 | All my days I have been troubled over this verse: “For I will appear in the cloud above the Ark cover” | Yoma 19b:4 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a</b> certain <b>Sadducee</b> who was appointed as High Priest, <b>who prepared the incense outside</b> and then <b>brought</b> it into the Holy of Holies. <b>Upon his emergence he was overjoyed</b> that he had succeeded. <b>The father of</b> that Sadducee <b>met him and said to him: My son, although we are Sadducees</b> and you performed the service in accordance with our opinion, <b>we fear the Pharisees</b> and do not actually implement that procedure in practice. The son <b>said to his</b> father: <b>All my days I have been troubled over this verse: “For I will appear in the cloud above the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). The Sadducees interpreted this verse to mean that God will appear above the Ark cover, i.e., will enter the Holy of Holies, only after the incense cloud is already there. <b>I said: When will</b> the opportunity <b>become available to me, and I will fulfill it</b> according to the Sadducee interpretation? <b>Now that</b> the opportunity <b>has become available to me,</b> will <b>I not fulfill it?</b> |
| Leviticus 16:2 | that he not die” | Yoma 53a:17 | § <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> “Speak to Aaron your brother that he should not come at all times into the sacred place within the curtain, before the Ark cover that is upon the Ark; <b>that he not die”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). This verse teaches the <b>punishment</b> for the omission of the smoke-raiser from the spices of the incense. With regard to the verse: <b>“For I will appear in a cloud</b> upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); this is the <b>warning</b> that it is prohibited to omit the smoke-raiser, which causes the cloud to rise. |
| Leviticus 16:2 | “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” | Yoma 53a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> the Sadducees <b>interpret;</b> what verse do they cite as the basis for their opinion? The Gemara answers that it was the verse: <b>“For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2), which the Sadducees say <b>teaches that he should prepare</b> it <b>outside,</b> so there would already be a cloud of incense, and only then should <b>he bring</b> it inside the Holy of Holies. |
| Leviticus 16:2 | the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” | Yoma 53a:4 | <b>The Sages said to them: Wasn’t it already stated</b> explicitly: <b>“And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:13), which indicates that the High Priest should present the incense only when he stands before God in the Holy of Holies? <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2)? This verse does not mean that there should already be an incense cloud before he enters. |
| Leviticus 16:2 | verse? | Yoma 53a:9 | § The Gemara analyzes the above <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that he includes a smoke-raiser in its</b> spices? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:13). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: One <b>verse for</b> another <b>verse?</b> The requirement of a smoke-raiser was already proven from the verse: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); why cite a second verse in support of the first one? |
| Leviticus 16:3 | bull” | Menachot 16a:15 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of two intentions,</b> e.g., one High Priest performed the initial presentation and was thereafter disqualified from performing the other presentations, and a second priest replaced him and performed the remaining presentations, there is still a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the verse: “With this shall Aaron come into the sacred place: <b>With</b> a young <b>bull”</b> (Leviticus 16:3), indicates that a High Priest may enter the Sanctuary <b>even with the blood of a bull,</b> i.e., he may continue the presentations with the blood of the offerings slaughtered by another High Priest. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the verse indicates that a High Priest may enter <b>“with</b> a young <b>bull,” but not with the blood of a bull,</b> i.e., a replacement High Priest must slaughter another bull and begin the presentations again, <b>what can be said?</b> If so, it is impossible for these presentations to be performed by two priests. |
| Leviticus 16:3 | says: One ram is the one that is mentioned here; | Yoma 3a:4 | The Gemara challenges: <b>This</b> works out <b>well</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that the obligatory offering on <b>Yom Kippur is one ram; however,</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that <b>they are two rams</b> that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur, <b>what is there to say?</b> According to that opinion, Yom Kippur is not comparable to the inauguration. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One ram is the one that is mentioned here;</b> as it is written: “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), and <b>it is the</b> same <b>one that is mentioned in the book of Numbers:</b> “And on the tenth day of the seventh month you will have a sacred gathering when you will afflict your souls; you will not do any labor, and you will offer a burnt-offering to the Lord for a sweet aroma: One young bull, one ram…” (Numbers 29:7–8). <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They are two rams</b> offered on Yom Kippur, <b>one mentioned here</b> in the book of Leviticus <b>and one mentioned in the book of Numbers.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:3 | with regard to Yom Kippur, now, since it is written: “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull for a sin-offering | Yoma 3b:5 | And <b>with regard to Yom Kippur, now, since it is written: “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull for a sin-offering</b> and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), with regard to the verse: <b>“And from the congregation of the children of Israel he will take two goat kids for a sin-offering</b> and one ram for a burnt-offering <b>and</b> Aaron <b>will offer his young bull as a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:5–6), <b>why do I</b> need the emphasis that the goats come from the property of the children of Israel? <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>this</b> term: <b>His,</b> written with regard to the calf, means it <b>is from his own</b> property. |
| Leviticus 16:3 | with a bull” | Yoma 49a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Ḥanina</b> actually <b>say that</b> this question, of one High Priest using the incense scooped by another, was difficult to answer? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say:</b> “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, <b>with a bull”</b> (Leviticus 16:3); this means that the High Priest must enter <b>with</b> the offering of <b>a bull and not with the blood of</b> the <b>bull?</b> In other words, the High Priest himself must slaughter his bull. Should a different priest slaughter the bull, receive its blood, and then die, the priest who replaces him may not enter the Holy of Holies with the blood of the bull slaughtered by his predecessor. Instead, he must bring a new bull, slaughter it, collect its blood, and take that blood inside. |
| Leviticus 16:3 | with a bull” | Yoma 49b:3 | § <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a High Priest <b>slaughtered</b> the bull <b>and died, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>another</b> High Priest may <b>enter</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with the blood</b> of the bull that his predecessor slaughtered? <b>Do we say</b> that the verse: “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, <b>with a bull”</b> (Leviticus 16:3) teaches that the priest must enter with the blood of a bull, but it need not necessarily be the blood of the bull he himself slaughtered, <b>and</b> in that case he may enter <b>even with the blood of a bull</b> slaughtered by someone else? <b>Or perhaps</b> the verse should be interpreted precisely: <b>“With a bull,” and not with the blood of a bull</b> slaughtered by another? |
| Leviticus 16:3 | “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, | Yoma 4a:4 | § The Gemara comments: A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the sequestering is derived from the inauguration; <b>and</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that it is derived from Sinai. The Gemara elaborates: A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> It was stated with regard to the inauguration: <b>“With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary,</b> with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3). To what is the term: With this, referring? It is referring to <b>that which is stated in the matter. What is</b> the matter? It is <b>the matter of the inauguration.</b> In the manner that the priest was prepared for the inauguration, so too is he prepared for Yom Kippur. <b>And what is stated in the matter of</b> the <b>inauguration?</b> It is that <b>Aaron</b> the priest <b>withdrew</b> for <b>seven</b> days <b>and served one day, and Moses transmitted</b> the Torah guidelines <b>to him all seven</b> days <b>in order to train him in the</b> Sanctuary <b>service.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:3 | bull, as it is written: “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, with a bull” | Yoma 50a:3 | <b>Rav Ashi said: It is reasonable</b> to say <b>in accordance with the one who said</b> that <b>blood is called</b> part of the <b>bull, as it is written: “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, with a bull”</b> (Leviticus 16:3). <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>he brings</b> it <b>in,</b> to the Holy of Holies, <b>with its horns? Rather,</b> he enters <b>with its blood, and</b> yet the Torah <b>calls that “a bull.”</b> This proves that the blood itself is called a bull. |
| Leviticus 16:3 | ram of Aaron | Yoma 50b:11 | The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Rav Sheshet said: No,</b> this is no proof, as it can be claimed that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>ram of Aaron</b> that the High Priest sacrifices as a burnt-offering on Yom Kippur, as the verse states: “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3). This offering is certainly the High Priest’s alone and is therefore classified as the offering of an individual. |
| Leviticus 16:3 | the one stated here | Yoma 70b:9 | The Gemara notes: Despite their disagreements, <b>everyone</b> agrees, <b>however,</b> that <b>there is</b> only <b>one ram</b> for the people. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Only one ram for the people is sacrificed, as <b>the one stated here</b> in Leviticus: “With this shall Aaron come into the Sanctuary: With a young bull for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), <b>is the same one</b> that is <b>stated in the Book of Numbers:</b> “And you shall sacrifice a burnt-offering to the Lord of pleasing odor: One young bull, one ram, seven unblemished year-old lambs shall be unto you” (Numbers 29:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: There are two rams</b> for the people: <b>One that is stated here</b> in Leviticus, which is part of the service of the day, <b>and one stated in the Book of Numbers,</b> which is part of the day’s additional offerings. |
| Leviticus 16:4 | and trousers of linen shall be on his flesh” | Sanhedrin 49b:15 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that nothing precedes</b> the donning of <b>the trousers</b> when the priest dresses? <b>As it is stated:</b> “He shall wear a sacred tunic of linen; <b>and trousers of linen shall be on his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 16:4). This indicates that the trousers come first, as they are worn directly on the flesh, proving that the list in the mishna is not in accordance with the order in which the priests dressed. |
| Leviticus 16:4 | The verse states: “And he shall have linen trousers upon his flesh” | Yoma 25a:2 | The Gemara supports this latter interpretation: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to follow Rav Sheshet’s interpretation of the mishna. <b>As, if it were to enter your mind</b> to say that the mishna is dealing <b>with those who won the lottery</b> and describes how their non-sacred garments were removed and sacred garments put on, how would one understand the statement: <b>They would leave only their trousers on them?</b> One would have to explain that the priests subsequently donned the sacred clothes on top of the non-sacred trousers; then they would remove the non-sacred trousers and replace them with the sacred trousers. <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that nothing should precede the trousers</b> when the priest dresses? <b>The verse states: “And he shall have linen trousers upon his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 16:4)? However, according to the proposed interpretation of the mishna, the priests donned the other sacred garments and put on the trousers after them. |
| Leviticus 16:4 | which is stated: “He shall be dressed in a sacred linen tunic, and with linen trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a linen belt, and he shall wear a linen mitre; they are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and then put them on” | Yoma 32a:5 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: From where</b> are derived the <b>five immersions and ten sanctifications</b> that the <b>High Priest immerses and sanctifies</b> his hands and feet, respectively, <b>on the day</b> of Yom Kippur? They are derived from that <b>which is stated: “He shall be dressed in a sacred linen tunic, and with linen trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a linen belt, and he shall wear a linen mitre; they are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and then put them on”</b> (Leviticus 16:4). From <b>this you learned: Anyone who moves from</b> an inner <b>service,</b> in the Holy of Holies, <b>to</b> an outer <b>service requires immersion. And</b> the verse <b>says: “They are sacred garments”; all of the garments are equated to one another.</b> Just as the High Priest immerses when donning the linen garments, so he immerses when donning the golden garments. |
| Leviticus 16:4 | states: “He shall be dressed in a sacred linen tunic | Yoma 32b:2 | The Gemara analyzes an additional clause from the <i>baraita</i> cited above. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: From where</b> are derived the <b>five immersions and ten sanctifications</b> that the <b>High Priest immerses and sanctifies</b> his hands and feet, respectively, <b>on the day</b> of Yom Kippur? They are derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “He shall be dressed in a sacred linen tunic</b>, and with linen trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a linen belt, and he shall wear a linen mitre; they are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and then put them on” (Leviticus 16:4). From <b>this you learned: Anyone who moves from</b> an inner <b>service,</b> in the Holy of Holies, <b>to</b> an outer <b>service,</b> and vice versa, <b>requires immersion.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> proof that the High Priest requires immersion when he changes <b>from golden garments to white garments;</b> however, <b>from where</b> is it derived that he requires immersion when he changes <b>from white garments to golden garments?</b> |
| Leviticus 16:4 | states: “They are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and then put them on” | Yoma 32b:4 | The Gemara asks: The <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>can be refuted: What</b> is the comparison <b>to white garments, as he enters with them to the innermost sanctum?</b> As the High Priest does not enter the Holy of Holies with the golden garments, apparently the sanctity of the white garments is greater. The Gemara comments: The source for the requirement to immerse when changing from white garments to golden garments <b>is that which is taught</b> later in the <i>baraita</i>: The verse <b>states: “They are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and then put them on”</b> (Leviticus 16:4), meaning immersion is required before donning all sacred garments. |
| Leviticus 16:4 | “They are sacred garments” | Yoma 32b:6 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that each and every immersion requires two sanctifications</b> of the hands and the feet? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states:</b> “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <b>and he shall remove</b> the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <b>And he shall wash</b> his flesh in water” (Leviticus 16:23–24). And it says: <b>“And he shall wash</b> his flesh in water in a sacred place <b>and put on</b> his garments” (Leviticus 16:24). The Gemara asks: <b>That is written</b> with regard <b>to immersion.</b> The washing mentioned in this verse is not sanctification of the hands and feet but rather immersion. The Gemara answers: <b>If it is not a matter</b> relating <b>to immersion, which is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“They are sacred garments”</b> (Leviticus 16:4), indicating that every change of clothes requires immersion, then <b>render it a matter</b> relating <b>to sanctification.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:4 | a linen | Yoma 35a:4 | The Gemara comments: <b>However, everyone,</b> both Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, <b>agrees that</b> the clothes of the <b>morning are superior</b> and must be more valuable than those of the afternoon. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Ilai, said</b> that with regard to the linen garments donned by the High Priest in the morning, <b>the verse states:</b> “He shall be dressed in a sacred <b>linen</b> tunic, and with <b>linen</b> trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a <b>linen</b> belt, and he shall wear <b>a linen</b> mitre” (Leviticus 16:4). From the fact that the verse repeats the term linen four times it is derived that the <b>choicest linen</b> should be used for this purpose. |
| Leviticus 16:4 | the verse states: “And put them on” | Zevachim 19b:6 | Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> After stipulating that the High Priest must wear the requisite vestments before performing the Yom Kippur service, <b>the verse states: “And put them on”</b> (Leviticus 16:4). This superfluous term serves to indicate that <b>wearing</b> the requisite vestments <b>is indispensable, but nothing else is indispensable.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:5 | “And from the assembly of the children of Israel | Shevuot 14a:4 | The Gemara questions some of the expositions of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: “Goat <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that the priests do not achieve atonement through it? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that the Merciful One states</b> that the goat <b>must be</b> purchased with funds collected <b>from</b> the <b>people.</b> The Gemara refutes this: <b>That</b> requirement <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And from the assembly of the children of Israel</b> he shall take two goats” (Leviticus 16:5). |
| Leviticus 16:5 | “He shall take two goats” | Yoma 62b:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> It states: <b>“He shall take two goats”</b> (Leviticus 16:5). The <b>minimum</b> number indicated by a plural term, as the word <b>goats</b> is here, is <b>two.</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: Two?</b> It teaches <b>that the two should be identical.</b> And <b>from where</b> do we derive that <b>even if the two</b> goats <b>are not identical</b> they are nevertheless <b>valid? The verses state</b> and repeat the word <b>goat, goat</b> (Leviticus 16:9–10) <b>to amplify</b> and indicate that the goats are valid even if they are not identical. |
| Leviticus 16:6 | his own | Shevuot 13b:12 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would</b> also <b>not achieve atonement through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron, as it is already stated:</b> “Aaron shall bring near <b>his own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), which indicates that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others. And if <b>that is so,</b> then <b>they do not have</b> any means through which to achieve <b>atonement.</b> But <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), <b>we have</b> clearly <b>found that they</b> do <b>have</b> a means of achieving <b>atonement.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:6 | “His household” | Shevuot 14a:3 | The Gemara clarifies the last part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And what</b> possible refutation is the <i>baraita</i> referring to when it says: <b>If it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning can be refuted? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> of the preceding proof that it is incorrect to suggest that all priests achieve atonement from the bull of Aaron, as with regard to it the term: <b>“His household”</b> (Leviticus 16:6), <b>is written,</b> which suggests that it atones only for his immediate family, then this can be refuted, as <b>all of</b> the priests <b>are</b> collectively <b>referred to as his household,</b> as is evident from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “House of Aaron, bless the Lord;</b> house of Levi, bless the Lord, <b>those who fear the Lord, bless the Lord.”</b> |
| Leviticus 16:6 | “His own | Shevuot 14a:5 | The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“His own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The High Priest <b>brings,</b> i.e., purchases, the bull <b>from his own</b> funds, <b>but he does not bring it from</b> funds collected <b>from the public.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:6 | “And it will atone for him and for his house” | Yoma 2a:2 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages would <b>even designate another wife for him lest his wife die, as it is stated</b> in the Torah portion of the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And it will atone for him and for his house”</b> (Leviticus 16:6); the Sages interpreted the term: <b>His house, that is his wife.</b> The priest must be married in order to fulfill this commandment. Due to the concern lest his wife die, another wife was designated to address that possibility. <b>The Rabbis said</b> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>If so,</b> that this is a concern, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> as what if the designated replacement wife dies? This possibility need not be a source of concern. |
| Leviticus 16:6 | and atone | Yoma 36b:10 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a halakhic midrash that it is written: “And Aaron is to offer his own bull as a sin-offering <b>and atone</b> for himself and for his household” (Leviticus 16:6). Apparently, <b>the verse is speaking of atonement</b> achieved through <b>words</b> of confession. Do <b>you say</b> it is <b>atonement</b> achieved through <b>words, or perhaps it is only atonement</b> achieved through sprinkling <b>blood,</b> as each mention of atonement associated with an offering involves the sprinkling of blood on the altar? |
| Leviticus 16:7 | As it is written: “He shall take the two goats” | Shevuot 13b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that priests are not atoned for by the scapegoat? <b>As it is written: “He shall take the two goats”</b> (Leviticus 16:7); one is used for the scapegoat and the other for the internal goat. With this verse, the <b>scapegoat is juxtaposed with the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary. It teaches that <b>just as the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as it is written with regard to</b> that goat: “The goat sin-offering <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), which indicates that it atones for Israelites and not for the priests, <b>so too, the scapegoat does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>other transgressions.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:8 | “And Aaron shall place lots on the two goats, | Yoma 37a:12 | § The mishna continues: <b>And there was</b> a lottery <b>receptacle</b> in the east of the courtyard <b>there, and in it were two lots. The Sages taught</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And Aaron shall place lots on the two goats,</b> one lot for God and one lot for Azazel” (Leviticus 16:8). <b>Lots</b> is a general term; they may be fashioned <b>from any material,</b> as the Torah does not specify the material of which they are made. |
| Leviticus 16:8 | the verse states: “One lot for God and one lot for Azazel” | Yoma 37a:13 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he</b> should <b>place two</b> lots <b>on this</b> goat <b>and two</b> lots <b>on that</b> goat; therefore, <b>the verse states: “One lot for God and one lot for Azazel”</b> (Leviticus 16:8), meaning <b>there is only one lot here for God, and there is only one lot here for Azazel.</b> Likewise, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>he</b> should <b>place</b> the lot <b>of God and</b> the lot <b>of Azazel on this</b> goat, <b>and</b> the lot <b>of God and</b> the lot <b>of Azazel on that</b> goat; therefore, <b>the verse states: One lot for God,</b> i.e., <b>there is only one</b> lot <b>here for God, and there is only one</b> lot <b>here for Azazel. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states lots,</b> in the plural, since each of the two goats has one lot not two? It is to teach <b>that</b> the two lots should <b>be identical;</b> that <b>he should not make one of gold and one of silver,</b> or <b>one big and one small.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:9 | and he shall offer it for a sin offering” | Chullin 24a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that statute is written with regard to</b> a certain matter, <b>we do not learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But</b> what <b>about Yom Kippur, with regard to which statute is written:</b> “And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you” (Leviticus 16:34), <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery renders</b> the goat <b>a sin offering, but a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:9 | and he shall sacrifice it for a sin offering” | Keritot 28a:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i> that discusses the drawing of lots for the two goats of Yom Kippur. The verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall sacrifice it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). This teaches that the drawing of <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering, and</b> likewise the act of the <b>priest,</b> placing the lot on the goat, <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:9 | lot | Kiddushin 14a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>anywhere that there is</b> a term that <b>precludes</b> another option <b>one cannot learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But there is</b> the case of the designation of the goats on <b>Yom Kippur, as it is written:</b> “The goat upon which the <b>lot</b> came up for the Lord” (Leviticus 16:9), <b>and:</b> “This shall be an everlasting <b>statute</b> to you” (Leviticus 16:34), which indicates that everything stated with regard to the mitzvot of Yom Kippur is critical to the performance of the service of the day. |
| Leviticus 16:9 | and he shall offer it for a sin-offering” | Kiddushin 14a:12 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery renders</b> it <b>a sin-offering,</b> but <b>a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin-offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:9 | “He shall offer it for a sin-offering” | Kiddushin 14a:14 | To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the goat: <b>“He shall offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9), to indicate that <b>the lottery renders</b> it <b>a sin-offering, but a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin-offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin-offering. And the reason</b> that a verbal designation is ineffective <b>is that the verse excluded</b> this possibility, from which it may be inferred <b>that if it were not so, one would learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>even though it is written with regard to it “statute.”</b> The same logic should apply in the case of <i>ḥalitza</i>, i.e., the term “so” should not prevent one from learning an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, and therefore it might be argued that a <i>yevama</i> can be released through a bill of divorce. |
| Leviticus 16:9 | “which came up” | Yoma 39b:18 | <b>When they disagree, it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that matters that are performed in the white garments outside of the Holy of Holies are not indispensable. <b>The one who said</b> that the drawing of the lots <b>is not indispensable</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the straightforward application of the principle of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And the one who said</b> that the drawing of the lots <b>is indispensable</b> claims that although Rabbi Yehuda’s principle is generally true, <b>it is different here,</b> in the case of the lottery, <b>because the verse repeated</b> the phrase <b>“which came up”</b> (Leviticus 16:9) <b>“which came up”</b> (Leviticus 16:10) <b>two times.</b> In the laws of sacrifices, a repeated phrase indicates the matter is indispensable. |
| Leviticus 16:9 | and he shall offer it for a sin-offering” | Yoma 40b:10 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the drawing of the lots is indispensable. A <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i> teaches: The verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery makes it a sin-offering,</b> but verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:9 | “The goat upon which | Yoma 40b:7 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the drawing of lots is indispensable. A <i>baraita</i> teaches (<i>Sifra</i>, <i>Aharei Mot</i> 2:4): <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>“The goat upon which</b> the lot” (Leviticus 16:9), <b>I would have said</b> the intention is that <b>he</b> must physically <b>place</b> the lot <b>upon it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states:</b> “On which <b>it came up”</b> (Leviticus 16:9), indicating that <b>once</b> the lot <b>has come up</b> from the receptacle, <b>it is not necessary</b> to do <b>more,</b> i.e., the lot does not have to be physically placed upon the goat. |
| Leviticus 16:9 | offer it for a sin-offering” | Yoma 41a:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: The verse states, with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And</b> Aaron shall…<b>offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). This indicates that <b>the lottery makes it a sin-offering,</b> but verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:10 | and atonement is stated there, | Yoma 36b:11 | <b>I will infer</b> via a verbal analogy: <b>Atonement is stated here,</b> with regard to the bull of the sin-offering, <b>and atonement is stated there,</b> with regard to the scapegoat: “And the goat designated by the lottery for Azazel shall be left standing alive before God, to atone with it” (Leviticus 16:10). <b>Just as</b> the <b>atonement that is stated with regard to the goat</b> is atonement achieved through <b>words,</b> as neither is the goat slaughtered nor is its blood sprinkled on the altar, <b>so too,</b> the <b>atonement stated with regard to the bull</b> refers to atonement achieved through <b>words.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:10 | “which came up” | Yoma 39b:18 | <b>When they disagree, it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that matters that are performed in the white garments outside of the Holy of Holies are not indispensable. <b>The one who said</b> that the drawing of the lots <b>is not indispensable</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the straightforward application of the principle of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.

| Leviticus 16:10 | shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement over him, | Yoma 40b:1 | The verse states: “But the goat on which the lot came up for Azazel <b>shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement over him,</b> to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10). The verse indicates that the goat must remain alive until a certain time. Were it to die beforehand, it would have to be replaced. <b>Until when</b> is the goat for Azazel <b>required to stand alive? Until the time of the application of the blood of its counterpart,</b> i.e., the goat for God; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It must remain alive <b>until the time of the verbal confession</b> over it. |
| Leviticus 16:10 | “to make atonement” | Yoma 40b:2 | <b>With regard to what do they disagree? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that the goat should remain alive <b>“to make atonement”</b> (Leviticus 16:10). This indicates that it must remain alive until it effects atonement. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon dispute which atonement the verse is referring to. <b>The verse speaks of atonement through</b> the application of the <b>blood</b> of the sin-offering goat. <b>And similarly it states: “When he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary,</b> and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <b>Just as there</b> the reference is <b>to atonement through blood, so too here</b> the verse is referring to <b>atonement through blood. This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:10 | states: “It shall be stood alive | Yoma 64b:3 | The language of <b>the <i>baraita</i></b> is precise <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as it teaches:</b> When the mishna says that the <b>second</b> goat is left to graze, <b>I do not know whether</b> it is referring to <b>the second</b> goat <b>of the first pair, or the second</b> goat <b>of the second pair. When</b> the verse <b>states: “It shall be stood alive</b> before the Lord, to make atonement over him, to send him away to Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10), it is <b>not</b> referring to the goat <b>whose counterpart died.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may it be inferred,</b> i.e., how does the verse indicate this point? The Gemara answers that it states: <b>“It shall be stood alive,”</b> in the future tense, indicating that it is <b>not</b> referring to the one <b>that already stood</b> with its counterpart that died. |
| Leviticus 16:10 | shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement | Yoma 65a:10 | The Sages <b>of the house of Rabbi Yannai said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, <b>shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement</b> over him, to send him away to Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10). <b>Until when must</b> the scapegoat <b>be alive? Until the blood of its counterpart is sprinkled,</b> and if it dies before, the blood is disqualified. |
| Leviticus 16:10 | “Into the wilderness” | Yoma 67b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the one</b> who <b>said</b> they <b>are prohibited, what does he do</b> with <b>this</b> term <b>wilderness,</b> i.e., what does he derive from it? The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are three expressions used to describe the location of the procedure with the scapegoat: <b>“Into the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:10), <b>“into the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), and <b>“in the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:22), <b>to include Nov and Givon</b> and <b>Shiloh,</b> when the Tabernacle was located there, <b>and the eternal Temple.</b> The mitzva of the scapegoat applied during the time periods when communal offerings were sacrificed in any of these locations. |
| Leviticus 16:10 | shall be stood alive | Yoma 71a:13 | The Gemara explains a difficulty with this: The phrasing of: <b>“And the one who sends” implies that it was</b> performed <b>earlier.</b> Alternatively, <b>Rava said:</b> Sending the goat away definitely took place earlier, as <b>the verse states:</b> “But the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel <b>shall be stood alive</b> before the Lord, to make atonement over him” (Leviticus 16:10). This teaches: <b>How long must it stand alive?</b> It must do so <b>until the moment of atonement. And when is the moment of atonement?</b> It is <b>at the moment of the presenting of the blood,</b> but <b>no later.</b> At that point it is already sent away. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | and atone for himself and for his household” | Megillah 20b:13 | <b>And</b> daytime is the time for <b>the confession over the bulls, as</b> this is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of <b>atonement</b> in this context and another instance of <b>atonement</b> in the context of <b>Yom Kippur. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to Yom Kippur,</b> the verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin-offering that is his, <b>and atone for himself and for his household”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). <b>The verse speaks of atonement</b> achieved through <b>words,</b> i.e., the atonement here is not referring to the sacrifice of offerings and the sprinkling of blood, but rather to atonement achieved through confession. <b>And the atonement</b> of Yom Kippur <b>is</b> only <b>during the day, as it is written:</b> “For <b>on that day will He atone for you”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). Just as the atonement on Yom Kippur must take place during the day, so must the other cases of atonement, over other bulls brought as sin-offerings, take place during the day. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | “And he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself” | Menachot 19a:9 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>one cannot derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> and the owner may not sprinkle the blood as he is not a priest, but he may still be obligated to slaughter the animal, as this rite may be performed by a non-priest, <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah <b>in</b> the context of the <b>Yom Kippur</b> service with regard to the High Priest: <b>“And he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). <b>By inference,</b> from the fact that the verse specifies that here the High Priest, who is the owner of the offering, must perform the slaughter, it is clear <b>that usually</b> the <b>slaughter does not require</b> the participation of the <b>owner.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:11 | as the verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is his” | Menachot 83a:11 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it is brought only from non-sacred animals? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is his”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). This teaches that the animal must come <b>from his</b> cattle, <b>and not from</b> money with which the second <b>tithe</b> has been redeemed. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | his house” | Yoma 13a:6 | § The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>And is designation</b> of a second wife <b>sufficient for him? The Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah: “And he shall make atonement for himself and for <b>his house”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). House means wife; <b>and this</b> designated woman <b>is not his wife</b> as they are not yet married. What purpose does designation serve if his wife dies on Yom Kippur? The Gemara answers: <b>He betroths her</b> before Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> that does not solve the problem. <b>As long as he has not married her, she is not</b> yet <b>his house,</b> i.e., his wife. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda says <b>that</b> not only is a replacement wife designated, but <b>he</b> actually <b>marries her. If so,</b> another problem arises. The High Priest <b>has two houses, and the Merciful One said: “And he shall make atonement for himself and for his house”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). He atones for one house <b>and not for two houses.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:11 | It says: “And Aaron shall then offer his bull of sin-offering and atone for himself and his household. | Yoma 36b:12 | <b>And if it is your wish to state</b> a claim rejecting that proof, there is a different proof. <b>It says: “And Aaron shall then offer his bull of sin-offering and atone for himself and his household.</b> And he shall slaughter his bull of sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:11). Here, the term atonement is used despite the fact that <b>the bull has not yet been slaughtered.</b> Apparently, the atonement of the bull is achieved through confession and not through sprinkling the blood. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | it is also written “Aaron” | Yoma 42a:7 | The Gemara analyzes Rav’s opinion: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav, what is different</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> that if it is slaughtered by a non-priest it is invalid? As Rav explained, it is different in <b>that,</b> with regard to it, <b>it is written “Elazar” and “statute.”</b> But with regard to <b>the bull</b> of the High Priest <b>it is also written “Aaron”</b> the High Priest (Leviticus 16:11) and <b>“statute”</b> (Leviticus 16:34). Based on Rav’s logic, that indicates that the priest is indispensable. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | which is for himself” | Yoma 51b:1 | § Returning to Rabbi Elazar’s question as to whether a High Priest can perform substitution for his bull, the Gemara seeks to prove that the other priests were not full partners in this offering but only gained atonement incidentally. <b>And let me derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> from the fact that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And Aaron shall sacrifice the bull of the sin-offering, <b>which is for himself”</b> (Leviticus 16:11), indicating that the High Priest <b>brings</b> the bull <b>from his own</b> property. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | which is for himself” | Yoma 51b:3 | I <b>might</b> have thought that the High Priest should <b>not bring</b> the bull from the property of the other priests ab initio, <b>but</b> if <b>he did bring</b> it from their property, the offering is <b>valid.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse</b> continues and <b>states again:</b> “And he shall slaughter the bull for the sin-offering, <b>which is for himself”</b> (Leviticus 16:11); <b>the text repeats this</b> phrase: “Which is for himself,” to emphasize that this requirement <b>is indispensable</b> and that if the High Priest brings a bull that belongs to someone else, the offering is invalid. |
| Leviticus 16:11 | Rav Ḥisda said: The verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is his” | Zevachim 98a:8 | The cited <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Sin offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as a sin offering is brought only from non-sacred</b> animals <b>and</b> is sacrificed specifically <b>in the daytime, and</b> its service must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand; so too all</b> offerings mentioned <b>are brought only from non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and</b> are sacrificed specifically <b>in the daytime, and</b> each one’s service must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand. And</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering, from where do we</b> derive that it is brought only from non-sacred animals? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: The verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is his”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). This teaches that the animal must come <b>from his</b> cattle, <b>and not from communal</b> property, <b>and not from</b> money upon which the second <b>tithe</b> has been redeemed. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | “Finely ground | Keritot 6b:5 | <b>And</b> as for the <b>extra three <i>maneh</i></b> of incense <b>from which the High Priest would bring in his handful</b> required <b>on Yom Kippur, one would place it in the mortar on Yom Kippur eve and grind it thoroughly so that</b> the incense <b>should be extra fine. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur, that it shall be: <b>“Finely ground</b> aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> with regard to all incense: <b>“And you shall grind some of it finely”</b> (Exodus 30:36)? <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “finely ground”?</b> This teaches that on Yom Kippur one must grind the incense more, <b>in order that it should be extra fine.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:12 | “His handful” | Menachot 11a:15 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that when the Torah states: <b>“His handful”</b> (Leviticus 16:12), in the context of the scooping of handfuls of incense by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, it means <b>in the manner that people</b> usually <b>scoop a handful,</b> by placing the backs of their hands into the vessel and bringing their hands together. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the High Priest <b>scooped a handful with his fingertips? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if he took a handful <b>from the sides? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he scooped a handful with this</b> hand <b>and with that</b> hand separately <b>and</b> then <b>brought them together?</b> The Gemara states: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | coals are called fire? And we raise a contradiction | Pesachim 75b:3 | <b>Rava raised a contradiction: Did Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi actually <b>say</b> that <b>coals are called fire? And we raise a contradiction</b> based on the verse: “And he shall take a pan full of burning coals from upon the altar before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:12). From the verse’s use of the word <b>coals,</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one may bring <b>smoldering</b> coals, meaning that the fire is almost extinguished and is not noticeable from the outside. <b>Therefore, the verse states: Fire. If</b> it had stated only <b>fire,</b> I <b>might</b> have thought it was referring to <b>a flame. Therefore, the verse states: Coals. How</b> are these two requirements reconciled? <b>One brings from the</b> coals that are <b>flickering,</b> meaning that the fire is visible. <b>Apparently,</b> plain <b>coals are not called fire.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:12 | and it will be all coal. Therefore, the verse states: “And he shall take a coal-pan full of burning coals from upon the altar” | Pesachim 75b:8 | <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that one should <b>answer as follows:</b> Based on the word <b>coals,</b> I <b>might</b> have thought they must be <b>smoldering and not flickering; therefore, the verse states: Fire. If</b> it had said only <b>fire,</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>one should bring half coal and half fire,</b> meaning that when one takes the coals from the altar they should be burning strongly and their flame should be visible, and <b>by</b> the time <b>he enters</b> the <b>inside</b> of the Holy of Holies the fire will die down <b>and it will be all coal. Therefore, the verse states: “And he shall take a coal-pan full of burning coals from upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 16:12), which indicates that <b>from the time of</b> their <b>taking they should be coals</b> and not flames. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | “finely ground | Yoma 45a:3 | § The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>sacrificed a <i>peras</i>,</b> half of a <i>maneh</i>, of incense <b>in the morning,</b> and a <i>peras</i> in the afternoon, but on this day the High Priest adds an additional handful of incense and burns it in the Holy of Holies. <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> the incense <b>was</b> ground <b>fine</b> as prescribed by the Torah, <b>but</b> on <b>this day it was superfine. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur that it is <b>“finely ground</b> aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>What</b> does the <b>verse</b> mean to <b>teach</b> by this? <b>Has it not already been stated: “And you shall grind some of it finely”</b> (Exodus 30:36)? <b>Rather, it teaches</b> that on Yom Kippur the incense has to be <b>superfine.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:12 | The verse states: “And he shall take a pan full of coals of fire from upon the altar from before the Lord” | Yoma 45b:10 | Since there are two equally logical derivations, a verse is required to teach the <i>halakha</i>: <b>The verse states: “And he shall take a pan full of coals of fire from upon the altar from before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:12). The description of the altar being “from before the Lord” suggests it is not entirely before the Lord. <b>Which altar</b> is only <b>partially before the Lord, but not all of it is before the Lord,</b> i.e., part of it lies directly parallel to the Sanctuary, but part of it does not? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is the outer altar.</b> Only the western side of it lies parallel to the entrance to the Sanctuary. In contrast, the inner altar is entirely within the Sanctuary and so is considered entirely before the Lord. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | However here, where it is not written: In his hands, but “and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small” | Yoma 47a:15 | The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Perhaps <b>there,</b> in the case of the handful of a meal-offering, <b>it</b> is different, <b>as it is written “in his handful,”</b> which indicates that he must use his hand rather than a vessel. <b>However here, where it is not written: In his hands, but “and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small”</b> (Leviticus 16:12), perhaps this teaches that the handfuls of incense need <b>not</b> be taken directly by hand, and the High Priest may use a vessel to scoop out the required amount. <b>Or perhaps</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“full”</b> and <b>“full,” from “his handful,”</b> which is stated regarding the meal-offering. If this verbal analogy is accepted, the High Priest may likewise scoop the incense only by hand. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | and bring | Yoma 47a:3 | § The mishna taught: <b>He scoops his handfuls</b> from the incense <b>and places it into the spoon. The</b> High Priest with <b>large</b> hands fills the spoon with incense <b>corresponding to the large</b> size of his hands, <b>and</b> the High Priest with <b>small</b> hands fills the spoon <b>corresponding to the small</b> size of his hands, <b>and this was the measure</b> of the spoon, according to the size of his hands. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a spoon on Yom Kippur?</b> After all, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And he shall take a coal pan full of coals of fire from off the altar from before the Lord, and <b>his hands full</b> of sweet incense beaten small <b>and bring</b> it within the veil” (Leviticus 16:12). This verse suggests that the handfuls are brought by hand rather than in a vessel. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | “His hands full” | Yoma 47b:12 | Likewise, <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that when the Torah states: <b>“His hands full”</b> (Leviticus 16:12), it means in the manner that <b>people</b> usually <b>fill their hands,</b> by placing the backs of their hands into the vessel and bringing their hands together. However, <b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the High Priest <b>scooped a handful with his fingertips?</b> Again, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if he took a handful <b>from downward</b> to <b>upward? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if he took a handful <b>from the side?</b> And <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he scooped a handful with this</b> hand <b>and with this</b> hand <b>and brought them together?</b> These questions are not answered either, and the Gemara states: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | and bring | Yoma 47b:9 | The Gemara explains that <b>Rav Pappa raised the dilemma</b> as follows: When the verse states: “And <b>his hands full</b> of sweet incense beaten small, <b>and bring</b> it within the veil” (Leviticus 16:12), does it mean that <b>we</b> merely <b>require</b> him to bring his handfuls, and <b>that is</b> fulfilled here, as in practice the High Priest brought full handfuls? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> that he must fulfill the following two commands in a similar manner: <b>“And he shall take…and he shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 16:12)? In other words, just as he must have the intention to take the incense, so too, he must intend to bring all of it. <b>And that</b> requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled here, as he did not intend to bring the extra incense between his fingers. No answer was found for this question, and the Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | “And he shall take…and he shall bring” | Yoma 49a:5 | § The Gemara returns to the issue of appropriate methods for taking handfuls of incense. <b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case where <b>another</b> priest <b>scooped and placed</b> the incense <b>into the hands</b> of the High Priest? The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the question: Do <b>we require: “His full hands,” and that is</b> fulfilled here, as in practice the High Priest has a handful of incense? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> that the High Priest must fulfill the mitzvot: <b>“And he shall take…and he shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 16:12), <b>and that is not</b> the case here, as the High Priest did not scoop and take the incense himself? This question was also left unanswered, and the Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | inner | Zevachim 109b:12 | <b>When they disagree</b> in the mishna, it is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>burning of</b> incense in the <b>inner</b> sanctum, i.e., in the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur. Concerning that obligation, the verse states: “And he shall take…his handful of sweet incense, beaten small, and bring it within the Curtain” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>“his handful”</b> indicates that <b>specifically</b> that measure must be burned in order to fulfill the obligation. Accordingly, he also holds that one who burns only an olive-bulk of that incense outside the courtyard is exempt. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>“his handful”</b> does <b>not</b> indicate that <b>specifically</b> that measure must be burned, and the obligation can be fulfilled even with a lesser amount. Accordingly, they also hold that one who burns even an olive-bulk of that incense outside the courtyard is liable. |
| Leviticus 16:12 | it is explicitly written concerning them: “And he shall take a coal pan full of coals of fire | Zevachim 58b:4 | <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to the statement about <b>any</b> sacrificial item <b>that is taken</b> from the altar <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, in the Temple courtyard, in order <b>to be placed</b> on the altar located <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>what are these</b> items? <b>If we say</b> these are the <b>coals of</b> the <b>Yom Kippur</b> service, which must be taken from the western side of the altar, <b>it is explicitly written concerning them: “And he shall take a coal pan full of coals of fire</b> from off the altar before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:12). The expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the western side of the altar, which is the side closest to the Sanctuary. |
| Leviticus 16:13 | “And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord” | Yoma 53a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:13); this means that <b>he</b> should <b>not prepare</b> by placing the incense <b>outside,</b> in the Sanctuary, <b>and bring</b> into the Holy of Holies a coal pan holding the burning incense. This was emphasized in order <b>to exclude the opinion of the Sadducees, who say</b> that <b>he</b> should <b>prepare</b> the incense <b>outside</b> and then <b>bring</b> it in. |
| Leviticus 16:13 | “And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord” | Yoma 53a:4 | <b>The Sages said to them: Wasn’t it already stated</b> explicitly: <b>“And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:13), which indicates that the High Priest should present the incense only when he stands before God in the Holy of Holies? <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2)? This verse does not mean that there should already be an incense cloud before he enters. |
| Leviticus 16:13 | As it is stated: “And the incense cloud shall cover the Ark cover” | Yoma 53a:5 | Instead, this verse is referring to the shape of the incense cloud, and it <b>teaches that he includes a smoke-raiser in its</b> spices, a plant that causes the smoke to rise straight up like a staff. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that he includes a smoke-raiser in its</b> spices? <b>As it is stated: “And the incense cloud shall cover the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:13). Therefore, if <b>he did not include a smoke-raiser, or if he omitted any one of its spices, he is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty. |
| Leviticus 16:13 | The verse states: “And it shall cover” | Yoma 53a:9 | § The Gemara analyzes the above <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that he includes a smoke-raiser in its</b> spices? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:13). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: One <b>verse for</b> another <b>verse?</b> The requirement of a smoke-raiser was already proven from the verse: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); why cite a second verse in support of the first one? |
| Leviticus 16:14 | before [ el penei ] the Ark Cover to the east” | Menachot 27b:13 | This is <b>as the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught:</b> With regard to the verse: “And he shall sprinkle it with his finger <b>before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover to the east”</b> (Leviticus 16:14), <b>this established a paradigm</b> that <b>any place</b> in the Torah <b>where it is stated: “Before [<i>penei</i>],”</b> it is referring to <b>nothing other than before</b> the <b>eastern</b> side. |
| Leviticus 16:14 | before [ al | Menachot 27b:17 | <b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> explanation: <b>According to Rabbi Yehuda, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> there the term <b><i>el</i></b> is used <b>specifically,</b> the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood <b>before [<i>al</i></b> <i>penei</i>] the Ark Cover” (Leviticus 16:14) should <b>also</b> mean that the sprinkling must be performed <b>specifically</b> upon the Ark Cover. <b>But</b> in the time <b>of the Second Temple, where there was no Ark or Ark Cover,</b> would Rabbi Yehuda then say that <b>indeed</b> the <b>sprinklings were not performed?</b> This is clearly not correct, as all agree that the sprinklings were performed in the Second Temple (see <i>Yoma</i> 53b). |
| Leviticus 16:14 | from here: “Upon the face of [ penei ] the Ark cover on the east” | Sukkah 5a:12 | <b>Rav Huna said</b> that the thickness of the Ark cover is derived <b>from here: “Upon the face of [<i>penei</i>] the Ark cover on the east”</b> (Leviticus 16:14), <b>and there is no face [<i>panim</i>]</b> of a person that measures <b>less than</b> one <b>handbreadth.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:14 | and before the Ark cover he shall sprinkle” | Yoma 55a:16 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the reason is that <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall sprinkle it with his finger upon the Ark cover, <b>and before the Ark cover he shall sprinkle”</b> (Leviticus 16:14). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: He shall sprinkle”</b> again, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “He shall sprinkle”?</b> This <b>teaches</b> with regard <b>to the first sprinkling that it must be counted with each and every</b> subsequent <b>one,</b> i.e., he must mention the first sprinkling every time. |
| Leviticus 16:14 | for that which the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught. As the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught: “Upon [ al penei ] the Ark cover to the east” | Yoma 55a:5 | The Gemara expresses surprise at this suggestion: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>downward</b> stated with regard <b>to the goat</b> is mentioned <b>to juxtapose it to upward</b> stated with regard <b>to the bull, one needs</b> the phrase “upon the Ark cover,” which deals with the blood of the bull, <b>for that which the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught. As the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught: “Upon [<i>al penei</i>] the Ark cover to the east”</b> (Leviticus 16:14); <b>this forms an analogy</b> that applies to the entire Torah: <b>Any place where it is stated “face [<i>penei</i>],”</b> it is referring to <b>nothing other</b> than the <b>eastern</b> side. <b>However, if you say,</b> as suggested by the question, that <b>upward</b> with regard <b>to the bull</b> is mentioned <b>to juxtapose</b> it to “upward” stated with regard to the goat, <b>for what purpose does downward</b> stated with regard <b>to the goat come;</b> what do we learn from this phrase? Rather, the first interpretation of the verse must be correct. |
| Leviticus 16:14 | seven | Yoma 55a:7 | <b>I</b> therefore <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from the verses. <b>It states</b> that <b>blood</b> is sprinkled <b>downward</b> in the case <b>of the bull, and it states</b> that <b>blood</b> is sprinkled <b>downward</b> in the case <b>of the goat. Just as</b> the blood that he sprinkles <b>downward</b> in the case <b>of the bull</b> consists of <b>seven</b> sprinklings, as the verse explicitly states: “And before the Ark cover he shall sprinkle seven times” (Leviticus 16:14), <b>so too,</b> the sprinkling of the blood <b>downward</b> in the case <b>of the goat</b> is performed <b>seven</b> times. |
| Leviticus 16:15 | “He shall slaughter the goat sin-offering of the people” | Shevuot 13b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the internal goat: <b>“He shall slaughter the goat sin-offering of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15); the term “of the people” excludes Aaron and the priests, and therefore indicates <b>that the priests do not achieve atonement through</b> that goat. <b>But</b> then, <b>through what do they achieve atonement?</b> Presumably, <b>through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron,</b> i.e., the bull of the High Priest. |
| Leviticus 16:15 | of the people” | Shevuot 13b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that priests are not atoned for by the scapegoat? <b>As it is written: “He shall take the two goats”</b> (Leviticus 16:7); one is used for the scapegoat and the other for the internal goat. With this verse, the <b>scapegoat is juxtaposed with the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary. It teaches that <b>just as the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as it is written with regard to</b> that goat: “The goat sin-offering <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), which indicates that it atones for Israelites and not for the priests, <b>so too, the scapegoat does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>other transgressions.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:15 | of the people” | Shevuot 14a:4 | The Gemara questions some of the expositions of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: “Goat <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that the priests do not achieve atonement through it? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that the Merciful One states</b> that the goat <b>must be</b> purchased with funds collected <b>from</b> the <b>people.</b> The Gemara refutes this: <b>That</b> requirement <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And from the assembly of the children of Israel</b> he shall take two goats” (Leviticus 16:5). |
| Leviticus 16:15 | and sprinkle it upon the Ark cover and before the Ark cover” | Yoma 55a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the sprinklings do not actually touch the Ark cover, derived? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: The verse states</b> with regard to the goat sacrificed as a sin-offering: “And he shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, <b>and sprinkle it upon the Ark cover and before the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:15). The verse should <b>not say downward,</b> i.e., “before the Ark cover,” with regard <b>to the goat, as</b> this <b>is unnecessary;</b> this requirement <b>is derived from</b> the term <b>downward</b> in connection <b>with</b> the <b>bull.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:15 | The Sages taught: “And sprinkle it upon the Ark cover and before the Ark cover” | Yoma 55a:6 | § <b>The Sages taught: “And sprinkle it upon the Ark cover and before the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:15). <b>We</b> have thereby <b>learned how many</b> times the High Priest must sprinkle <b>upward for the goat,</b> that is, <b>one</b> sprinkling, as it states: “And sprinkle.” However, with regard to the sprinkling <b>downward for the goat,</b> before the Ark cover, <b>I do not know how many</b> times he must sprinkle. |
| Leviticus 16:15 | the verse states: “And he shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull” | Yoma 55a:9 | The Gemara retorts: <b>On the contrary, one derives</b> one aspect of <b>a matter from</b> another aspect of <b>that</b> same <b>matter,</b> i.e., one should infer the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of the goat from another <i>halakha</i> involving that same blood, <b>and one does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>that matter from</b> an external <b>matter.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 16:15). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “As he did,”</b> because the whole process is explicitly stated a second time, <b>what</b> then is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “As he did”?</b> It comes to teach <b>that all his actions should be alike,</b> down to every detail. Consequently, <b>just as</b> the sprinklings <b>downward</b> in the case <b>of the bull</b> are <b>seven, so too,</b> the sprinklings <b>downward</b> in the case <b>of the goat</b> are <b>seven.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “And he shall make atonement for the holy place, from the impurity of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions, for all their sins” | Keritot 25b:10 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the holy place, from the impurity of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This indicates that <b>sins,</b> i.e., violations committed unwittingly, <b>are similar to transgressions,</b> violations committed intentionally: <b>Just as</b> Yom Kippur atones for <b>transgressions, which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering,</b> as personal sin offerings are brought only for unwitting sins, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> Yom Kippur <b>atones</b> only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> Yom Kippur <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:16 | of Rav Dimi, | Keritot 26a:1 | and find a way <b>to explain</b> that <i>halakha</i>, <b>neither from</b> that statement <b>of Rav Dimi,</b> who derived it from the verse: “And from their transgressions, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16), <b>nor from that</b> statement <b>of Abaye,</b> who derived it from the verse: “For all their transgressions, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:21). |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel | Shevuot 12b:7 | The Gemara answers: They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the High Priest sacrificing the internal goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16). The verse is referring to two categories of sin. The first category is <b>acts of rebellion [<i>pesha’im</i>]; these are the rebellious sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that King Jehoram of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: <b>“The king of Moab rebelled [<i>pasha</i>] against me”</b> (II Kings 3:7). <b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to a rebellion against Judah: <b>“Then Libnah rebelled [<i>tifsha</i>] at that time”</b> (II Kings 8:22). The second category is <b>sins [<i>ḥataot</i>]; these are unwitting sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “If an individual person shall transgress [<i>teḥeta</i>] unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:2). |
| Leviticus 16:16 | the verse states: “And from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” | Shevuot 7b:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>this goat</b> offering <b>would atone for all</b> cases of the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> even where there was awareness at the beginning and at the end. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16), which indicates that the goat offering atones only for <b>sins</b> that are <b>similar to acts of rebellion. Just as</b> it atones for <b>acts of rebellion that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering,</b> as sin-offerings brought by an individual are brought only for unwitting sins, <b>so too,</b> it atones only for <b>sins that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> As long as one does not become aware of his sin, it cannot be atoned for through the sliding-scale offering. Accordingly, the goat will atone for it. |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel | Shevuot 7b:5 | § The mishna continues: For cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning,</b> but then transgressed during a lapse of awareness <b>and</b> still <b>had no awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, and Yom Kippur itself, suspend any punishment that he deserves until he becomes aware of his transgression, at which point he must bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the internal goat offering: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16). |
| Leviticus 16:16 | the verse states: “From the impurities of the children of Israel” | Shevuot 7b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that each of these sins is referred to as impurity: <b>With regard to idol worship</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “For he had given his offspring to Molekh <b>in order to render impure My Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 20:3). <b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations</b> the verse <b>states: “You shall safeguard My charge not to do any of the abominable traditions</b> that were done before you <b>and not to render yourself impure through them”</b> (Leviticus 18:30). <b>With regard to bloodshed</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “The land will not atone for the blood that was spilled on it except through the blood of the one who spilled it; <b>you shall not render the land impure”</b> (Numbers 35:34). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the goat</b> offering <b>would atone for these three</b> types of <b>impurities.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “From the impurities of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities <b>but not</b> for <b>all impurities.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “For all their sins” | Shevuot 8a:10 | The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> instead that the goat offering atones for <b>a woman after childbirth, as</b> the Torah <b>differentiates</b> her from other people who must bring a sin-offering following a period of impurity in <b>that she brings a sliding-scale</b> offering, whereas others bring a fixed sin-offering? <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> The verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16), <b>and not: For all their impurities.</b> Accordingly, since the offering brought by a woman after childbirth is not to atone for a sin, but due to the fact that she went through a period of ritual impurity, the goat offering will not atone for her. |
| Leviticus 16:16 | the verse states: “And from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” | Shevuot 8a:18 | § The Gemara cites the next part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>this goat</b> offering <b>would atone for all</b> cases of the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> even where there was awareness at the beginning and at the end. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16), which indicates that the goat offering atones only for transgressions with regard to which the perpetrator is not subject to bring an offering brought by an individual to atone for himself. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the case for which the goat offering does not atone? Where one <b>had awareness at the beginning and had awareness at the end.</b> The Gemara objects: But the person in <b>that</b> case <b>is subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> If so, even without this verse it would be obvious that the goat offering would not atone for him and absolve him from his obligation to bring an offering. |
| Leviticus 16:16 | the verse states: “From the impurities | Shevuot 8a:5 | § The Gemara continues to analyze the next part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the goat</b> offering <b>would atone for these three</b> types of <b>impurities.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “From the impurities</b> of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 16:16). The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities <b>but not</b> for <b>all impurities. What do we find</b> is the impurity <b>that the verse differentiates from all</b> other <b>impurities?</b> We find it <b>with regard to</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. It is specifically for this transgression that the Torah provides one with the means of achieving atonement, i.e., by bringing a sliding-scale offering. <b>So too here,</b> since the verse limits the atonement of the goat offering to transgressions involving impurity, it is logical that it can also atone only <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them” | Yoma 53a:14 | The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This verse teaches that this rite must be performed not only that first time in the wilderness, but wherever the Divine Presence dwells. |
| Leviticus 16:16 | and so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting | Yoma 56b:14 | § The mishna taught: <b>And</b> the High Priest <b>sprinkled from</b> the blood of the bull <b>on the curtain opposite the Ark from outside</b> the Holy of Holies. <b>The Sages taught:</b> “And he shall make atonement for the sacred place because of the impurities of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; <b>and so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting</b> that dwells with them in the midst of their impurity” (Leviticus 16:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Just as he sprinkles in the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies, <b>so he sprinkles in the Sanctuary,</b> the Tent of Meeting, toward the curtain. |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “That dwells with them in the midst of their impurity” | Yoma 57a:1 | <b>Now you are certainly impure, as it is written</b> about the Jewish people: <b>“Her impurity was in her skirts”</b> (Lamentations 1:9), and the Divine Presence does not dwell upon the Jews when they are impure. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: Come</b> and <b>see what is written about</b> the Jewish people: <b>“That dwells with them in the midst of their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This indicates that <b>even when they are impure, the Divine Presence dwells among them.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:16 | “And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting | Zevachim 57a:18 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that a matter derived via a juxtaposition and another principle <b>is not</b> considered <b>a juxtaposition, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the rites performed by the High Priest on Yom Kippur: <b>“And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting</b> that dwells with them in the midst of their impurity” (Leviticus 16:16). |
| Leviticus 16:17 | But isn’t it written: “And no man shall be in the Tent of Meeting | Gittin 54b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> does it <b>deem him credible? Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna says: The High Priest on Yom Kippur will prove</b> this point, <b>as when</b> he <b>says</b> that he had <b>improper intent,</b> he is <b>deemed credible. And from where do we know</b> that he had improper intent? <b>But isn’t it written: “And no man shall be in the Tent of Meeting</b> when he goes in to make atonement for the holy place” (Leviticus 16:17)? <b>Rather, is it not because</b> he is <b>deemed credible</b> in his testimony even after he performed the service, and it is no longer in his power to disqualify the offering? |
| Leviticus 16:17 | states: “And he shall atone for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel” | Horayot 13a:2 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the bull of the anointed priest and the bull of the congregation are pending, the bull of the anointed priest precedes the bull of the congregation in all its actions. Since the anointed</b> priest <b>atones</b> for the entire Jewish people, <b>and the congregation gains atonement, it is logical that the one who atones will precede the one who gains atonement. And so</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall atone for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:17). |
| Leviticus 16:17 | written “And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting | Yoma 43b:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the blood of the bull is stirred by a priest standing on the fourth row of tiles in the Sanctuary, while the High Priest sacrifices the incense in the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <b>But is it</b> not <b>written “And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting</b> when he goes in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, until he comes out” (Leviticus 16:17). How then could the stirrer be standing in the Sanctuary? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> Emend and <b>teach</b> the mishna as saying: The fourth row of tiles <b>of the Sanctuary,</b> i.e., outside the Sanctuary on the fourth row from its entrance. |
| Leviticus 16:17 | “And have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel” | Yoma 44a:3 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes by expounding the final part of the verse: <b>“And have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:17). This teaches that <b>his atonement precedes the atonement of his household; the atonement of his household precedes that atonement of his brethren, the priests; the atonement of his brethren, the priests, precedes the atonement of the entire community of Israel.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:17 | “And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when he goes in to atone in the Sanctuary, | Zevachim 83a:3 | § The mishna teaches that the Sages disagree as to the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the priest carrying the blood of a sin offering whose blood placement is on the external altar <b>entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to atone</b> through sprinkling, but in practice the priest did not actually sprinkle the blood. According to Rabbi Eliezer the blood is disqualified, whereas Rabbi Shimon maintains that the blood is disqualified only if the priest sprinkles it in the Sanctuary. Concerning this, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here:</b> “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting <b>to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the service of the High Priest on Yom Kippur: <b>“And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when he goes in to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> until he comes out” (Leviticus 16:17). |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat | Chullin 98b:8 | The Gemara objects: <b>Let</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>learn from this</b> case that all forbidden food can be nullified when it is mixed with permitted food of its own type. The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat</b> and put it upon the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). <b>Both of</b> these two bloods <b>are</b> mixed <b>with each other, and</b> although a bull has more blood than a goat has, the verse makes reference to the blood of the goat, indicating that it maintains its own identity and is <b>not nullified.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat | Menachot 22a:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse.</b> With regard to the sacrificial rites performed by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, the Torah teaches that after sprinkling of the blood of the bull and of the goat separately between the staves of the Ark and on the Curtain, the blood of the two animals is mixed together and presented on the golden altar inside the Sanctuary. The verse states: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat</b> and put it on the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 16:18). <b>It is a known matter that the blood of the bull is more than the blood of a goat.</b> Why then is the blood of the goat not nullified? Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>The Rabbis,</b> i.e, the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>hold:</b> |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat, | Temurah 5b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Abaye, from where does he</b> derive <b>this conclusion,</b> that such blood is sacrificed? The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from</b> the verse concerning the High Priest’s service on Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat,</b> and put it upon the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 16:18). One might ask: <b>But isn’t there more blood of the bull than of the goat?</b> Why is the blood of the goat not nullified? <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that</b> offerings <b>brought upon</b> the altar <b>do not nullify one another, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase in the verse <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat”</b> serves to teach <b>that they must be mixed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Accordingly, Abaye derives that mixtures of blood may be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 16:18 | written. | Yoma 57b:13 | The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya was</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>who said</b> that the High Priest <b>mixes</b> the blood. In general, he maintains that whenever a verse mentions two matters, <b>although</b> the term: <b>Together, is not written</b> explicitly, <b>it is considered as though</b> the term: <b>Together, is</b> indeed <b>written.</b> In other words, two items that appear in the same verse are treated as combined unless expressly stated otherwise. By contrast, Rabbi Yonatan maintains that even if two matters are mentioned together they are treated separately unless the verse uses the term: Together. In this case, the verse states: “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” (Leviticus 16:18). Therefore, Rabbi Yoshiya rules that the High Priest must place the two sets of blood together. |
| Leviticus 16:18 | and he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat, | Yoma 57b:15 | The Gemara comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>contrary to our response,</b> but in accordance with the initial assumption: “And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord, and make atonement for it; <b>and he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat,</b> and put it on the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). This verse teaches <b>that</b> the blood of the bull and the goat should <b>be mixed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:18 | Rabbi Yonatan said to him: But wasn’t it already stated: “Of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” | Yoma 58a:2 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan said to him: But wasn’t it already stated: “Of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat”</b> (Leviticus 16:18), which teaches that each set of sprinklings must be performed by itself? <b>If so, why is “once” stated?</b> This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that he must perform the rite <b>once and not</b> perform <b>two</b> sets of sprinklings <b>from the blood of the bull;</b> and likewise he must perform the rite <b>once and not</b> perform <b>two</b> sets of sprinklings <b>from the blood of the goat.</b> From the blood of each of the animals, the High Priest presents only one set of sprinklings. This shows that Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan indeed disagree with regard to this issue. |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” | Yoma 58a:3 | <b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat”</b> (Leviticus 16:18). This verse teaches <b>that</b> the blood of the bull and the goat <b>should be mixed together.</b> Do <b>you say that they should be mixed together, or perhaps that is not</b> the case; rather, he presents <b>from this</b> blood <b>by itself and from that by itself?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Once.”</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> who said the two sets of blood are mixed, as stated in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord | Yoma 58b:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is stated: <b>“And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord</b>, and make atonement for it; and he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat, and place it upon the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). <b>This</b> altar <b>is the golden altar,</b> since the outer altar is not before the Lord in the Sanctuary. <b>He began to cleanse</b> the altar, sprinkling the blood <b>downward. From where does he begin?</b> He begins <b>from the northeast corner,</b> and proceeds to the <b>northwest</b> corner, and then to the <b>southwest</b> corner, and finally to the <b>southeast</b> corner. A way to remember this is: At the <b>place</b> where <b>he begins</b> sprinkling the blood <b>for a sin-offering</b> sacrificed <b>on the outer altar,</b> the southeast corner, <b>there he finishes</b> sprinkling the blood <b>on the inner altar.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:18 | The Sages taught: “And he shall go out to the altar” | Yoma 58b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: “And he shall go out to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 16:18). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? Upon his exit, after sprinkling toward the curtain, the High Priest must necessarily reach the golden altar. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said:</b> It is <b>because we find with regard to the bull brought for</b> a violation of <b>all the mitzvot,</b> i.e., the bull that must be brought in the event that the community errs with regard to any of the mitzvot, which is called the bull for an unwitting communal sin, <b>that when the priest sprinkles</b> toward the curtain <b>he stands past the altar and sprinkles</b> back <b>toward the curtain;</b> therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that here, too,</b> the rite should be performed in <b>the same</b> manner. |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” | Zevachim 81a:9 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is it teaching that the blood of offerings <b>that ascend</b> to the altar <b>do not nullify one another? This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat”</b> (Leviticus 16:18), from which it is understood that although the blood of the two animals is in the same vessel, they each retain their distinct identity. The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as <b>there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here, and there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who derives it from there.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:18 | “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” | Zevachim 81b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>first</b> part of the blood <b>of a burnt offering and</b> the blood of <b>a firstborn</b> offering. <b>But</b> if so, <b>what is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is it teaching that the blood of offerings that <b>ascend</b> to the altar <b>do not nullify one another?</b> This <i>halakha</i> is already <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat”</b> (Leviticus 16:18). The Gemara explains: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as <b>there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here, and there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who derives it from there.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:18 | Going out, | Zevachim 83a:2 | Rava explains the sides of the dilemma: Do we say that <b>here</b> the area of the Curtain and the golden altar <b>is certainly one place,</b> as they are both in the Sanctuary, and therefore the blood should not be disqualified by being brought back toward the Curtain? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>we call</b> the taking of the blood to the golden altar: <b>Going out,</b> in the verse: “And he shall go out unto the altar” (Leviticus 16:18), its return to the Curtain should be considered bringing in, and therefore the blood should be disqualified? No answers were found, and therefore the Gemara states that these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 16:19 | and cleanse it and sanctify it” | Yoma 59a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>Everyone</b> agrees <b>in any case</b> that in the place <b>where he finishes the presentations</b> of the <b>corners, that</b> is <b>where he places</b> the blood <b>on</b> the altar’s <b>top.</b> They disagree only about the location of the final presentation, whether it is on the south or the north side. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this agreement? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, <b>and cleanse it and sanctify it”</b> (Leviticus 16:19), which indicates that the <b>place he sanctified</b> by sprinkling blood, the corner of the altar where he sprinkled last, <b>there he shall</b> also begin to <b>cleanse</b> and sprinkle on top. |
| Leviticus 16:20 | And similarly it states: “When he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary, | Yoma 40b:2 | <b>With regard to what do they disagree? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that the goat should remain alive <b>“to make atonement”</b> (Leviticus 16:10). This indicates that it must remain alive until it effects atonement. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon dispute which atonement the verse is referring to. <b>The verse speaks of atonement through</b> the application of the <b>blood</b> of the sin-offering goat. <b>And similarly it states: “When he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary,</b> and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <b>Just as there</b> the reference is <b>to atonement through blood, so too here</b> the verse is referring to <b>atonement through blood. This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:20 | bull; and the Torah said: “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place” | Yoma 57a:12 | <b>They said this</b> answer <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya</b> in Eretz Yisrael, whereupon <b>he said: Foolish Babylonians! Because they live in a dark,</b> low <b>land, they speak darkened <i>halakhot</i>,</b> devoid of logic. If this solution is followed, when the High Priest sprinkles the mixture of bull and goat blood, <b>he</b> thereby <b>presents</b> the <b>upward</b> sprinklings <b>of the goat before</b> he sprinkles the <b>downward</b> presentations of the <b>bull; and the Torah said: “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 16:20), which teaches: <b>He finishes the blood of the bull</b> by sprinkling upward and downward, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward he finishes the blood of the goat.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:20 | “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place” | Yoma 60b:4 | In proof that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that pouring the remainders of blood is no different from the sprinkling of blood, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that is referring to a case where the pouring of the remainders of the blood is entirely omitted. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 16:20). This verse indicates that <b>if he performed the atonement, he has finished</b> the order of the service; <b>and if he did not perform the atonement, he has not finished.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda said to him: Why do we not say</b> that <b>if he finished</b> sprinkling all the blood, <b>he has performed atonement; and if he did not finish, he has not performed atonement?</b> This would indicate <b>that if one of the presentations is lacking</b> it is as though <b>he did nothing.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:20 | The Sages taught | Yoma 61a:6 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <b>“And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place,” this is</b> the sprinklings in <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies; <b>“Tent of Meeting,” this is the</b> sprinklings toward the curtain in the <b>Sanctuary; “altar,” as per its plain meaning.</b> This <b>teaches that they each</b> constitute <b>a separate atonement unto themselves,</b> i.e., each one of these actions achieves a distinct atonement. If a disqualification occurs in any of the atoning actions, he must return to the beginning of that action. |
| Leviticus 16:20 | “And when he has finished atoning for the Sanctuary” | Zevachim 40a:13 | <b>Rav Pappa objects to this: And how can you say this,</b> that Rabbi Yehuda derives from here that the placements are indispensable? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse discussing the Yom Kippur service states: <b>“And when he has finished atoning for the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 16:20). This indicates that <b>if he performed the atonement,</b> i.e., the sprinklings, inside the Sanctuary, <b>he has finished</b> the order of the service, even though he has not poured the remainder of the blood on the base of the altar; <b>and if he did not perform the atonement, he has not finished;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:20 | “And when he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary, | Zevachim 52a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that the reason the Torah writes the phrase “of the bull” is to teach that failure to place the blood on the base of the external altar <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the service of Yom Kippur, after sprinkling the blood in the Sanctuary: <b>“And when he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary,</b> and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). This teaches that once he has sprinkled the blood in the innermost sanctum <b>all the atonements are completed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:20 | “And when he has finished atoning | Zevachim 52b:13 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning the sacrificial rite performed by the High Priest on Yom Kippur: <b>“And when he has finished atoning</b> for the Sanctuary, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). This verse indicates that <b>if he performed</b> the <b>atonement, he has finished</b> the service, <b>but if he did not perform</b> the <b>atonement, he has not finished.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda said to him: For what</b> reason <b>do we not say: If he finished, he has performed atonement,</b> but <b>if he did not finish, he has not performed atonement?</b> This derivation would indicate <b>that if one of any of the</b> blood <b>placements is lacking</b> it is as though <b>he did nothing.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “And he shall send it away with an appointed man | Keritot 14a:17 | <b>Rather, if</b> the statement <b>of Rafram was stated,</b> it <b>was stated with regard to this</b> case, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the scapegoat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall send it away with an appointed man</b> into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:21). The word <b>“man”</b> is mentioned in order <b>to render a non-priest fit</b> for this task. The term <b>“appointed”</b> indicates that the scapegoat is always sent away at the appropriate time, <b>even</b> when the appointed man is <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity, and even</b> when Yom Kippur occurs <b>on Shabbat.</b> In addition, the word <b>“appointed”</b> is referring <b>to</b> one who was <b>designated</b> for the task the day before. |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, for all their sins” | Keritot 25b:12 | <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the matter is derived <b>from here,</b> a verse that deals with the scapegoat: <b>“And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21). This indicates that <b>sins are similar to transgressions: Just as</b> the scapegoat atones for <b>transgressions, which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> the scapegoat atones only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> it <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering. And the verse limited</b> the scope of atonement specifically <b>with regard to the scapegoat,</b> in order <b>to say that</b> despite the scapegoat’s greater capacity to achieve atonement, <b>it does not atone for sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, for all their sins” | Keritot 25b:14 | <b>It was also stated</b> with regard to this matter that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he related a statement that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21). This indicates that <b>sins are similar to transgressions: Just as</b> the scapegoat <b>atones</b> for transgressions, <b>which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> the scapegoat <b>atones</b> only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> it <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:21 | from the beginning of the verse: “And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel” | Keritot 25b:16 | <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that an answer to Rav Dimi’s question can be inferred <b>from the beginning of the verse: “And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b>“iniquities”</b> is referring to <b>those</b> sins that were performed <b>intentionally. And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Because he despised the word of the Lord, and has broken His commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, <b>his iniquity shall be upon him”</b> (Numbers 15:31). |
| Leviticus 16:21 | of Abaye, | Keritot 26a:1 | and find a way <b>to explain</b> that <i>halakha</i>, <b>neither from</b> that statement <b>of Rav Dimi,</b> who derived it from the verse: “And from their transgressions, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16), <b>nor from that</b> statement <b>of Abaye,</b> who derived it from the verse: “For all their transgressions, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:21). |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “For all their sins” | Keritot 26a:11 | The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>an uncertain leper</b> who is obligated to bring an offering for purification <b>for</b> whom <b>Yom Kippur has passed should not bring</b> his offering, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur has passed for him, as this is</b> a case of <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> since God knows if he is impure. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), <b>but not for all their impurity,</b> and this offering is also brought for purification. |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “For all their sins” | Keritot 26a:8 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: If that is so, that Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware, <b>a woman who gave birth who</b> is <b>uncertain</b> whether her miscarriage obligated her to bring a sin offering <b>should not bring</b> her sin offering after <b>Yom Kippur has passed, due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur atoned for her. As this is</b> a case of <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> since God alone knows the nature of her miscarriage. <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> With regard to Yom Kippur the verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), indicating that Yom Kippur atones for all their sins <b>but not for all their impurity.</b> A woman who gives birth does not bring a sin offering for atonement, but rather in order to purify her and thereby enable her to consume sacrificial meat. |
| Leviticus 16:21 | raises a contradiction | Menachot 92a:18 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the Yom Kippur scapegoat, the verse states: “And Aaron shall place both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins” (Leviticus 16:21). The emphasis of <b>“the live</b> goat” indicates that with regard to communal offerings of goats, only <b>the live</b> goat, i.e., the scapegoat, <b>requires placing hands, but the goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Both offerings require placing hands. The verse specifies the requirement with regard to the <b>live</b> goat to teach that it <b>requires</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest, |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “And Aaron shall place both his hands [ yadav ] | Menachot 93b:14 | § The mishna adds that the placing of hands is performed <b>with two hands.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: As the verse states</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And Aaron shall place both his hands [<i>yadav</i>]</b> upon the head of the live goat” (Leviticus 16:21). The word <i>yadav</i>, meaning: His hands, is written without a second <i>yod</i>, and so if read without vowels it reads as: <b>His hand. But it is</b> also <b>written “both,”</b> which makes clear that the intention is that he must use both of his hands. <b>This established a paradigm</b> that in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>His hand, there are here two</b> hands, <b>unless the verse</b> explicitly <b>specifies</b> that there is only <b>one.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “And he shall confess over it all of the children of Israel’s wrongdoings and all their rebellions and all their sins” | Yoma 36b:5 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>How does he confess?</b> What is the formula of the confession? It is: <b>I have done wrong, I have rebelled, and I have sinned. And likewise, with regard to the scapegoat, it says</b> that the confession is in that order: <b>“And he shall confess over it all of the children of Israel’s wrongdoings and all their rebellions and all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21). <b>And likewise,</b> when God revealed Himself to <b>Moses it says: “Forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion and sin”</b> (Exodus 34:7). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say</b> that the meaning of these terms is: <b>Wrongdoings are intentional</b> transgressions, <b>and likewise it says: “That soul shall be cut off, it bears its guilt”</b> (Numbers 15:31). This refers to sins committed intentionally. |
| Leviticus 16:21 | The Sages taught, | Yoma 66a:15 | It was taught in the mishna that the priest <b>passed</b> the goat <b>to the one who was to lead it</b> to the wilderness. <b>The Sages taught,</b> with regard to the verse: “And he shall send it away with an appointed man into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:21), that the halakhic midrash interprets the word <b>man</b> as mentioned in order <b>to qualify a non-priest</b> for this task. The word <b>appointed</b> indicates |
| Leviticus 16:21 | “into the wilderness” | Yoma 67b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the one</b> who <b>said</b> they <b>are prohibited, what does he do</b> with <b>this</b> term <b>wilderness,</b> i.e., what does he derive from it? The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are three expressions used to describe the location of the procedure with the scapegoat: <b>“Into the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:10), <b>“into the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), and <b>“in the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:22), <b>to include Nov and Givon</b> and <b>Shiloh,</b> when the Tabernacle was located there, <b>and the eternal Temple.</b> The mitzva of the scapegoat applied during the time periods when communal offerings were sacrificed in any of these locations. |
| Leviticus 16:22 | in the wilderness” | Yoma 67b:1 | established his opinion based on a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the goat shall bear upon it all their iniquities to a land which is cut off; and he shall let go the goat <b>in the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:22). The concluding phrase, “in the wilderness,” is unnecessary, and indicates that the goat shall be available for anyone to use, similar to a wilderness. <b>And the one</b> who <b>said</b> they <b>are prohibited</b> based his opinion on the same verse, <b>as it is written, “cut off” [<i>gezeira</i>],</b> which indicates a prohibition. |
| Leviticus 16:22 | “in the wilderness” | Yoma 67b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the one</b> who <b>said</b> they <b>are prohibited, what does he do</b> with <b>this</b> term <b>wilderness,</b> i.e., what does he derive from it? The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are three expressions used to describe the location of the procedure with the scapegoat: <b>“Into the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:10), <b>“into the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), and <b>“in the wilderness”</b> (Leviticus 16:22), <b>to include Nov and Givon</b> and <b>Shiloh,</b> when the Tabernacle was located there, <b>and the eternal Temple.</b> The mitzva of the scapegoat applied during the time periods when communal offerings were sacrificed in any of these locations. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and shall leave them there” | Chullin 117a:15 | The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches that</b> these four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are not fit for further use, and <b>they require interment. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, who said</b> that the verse teaches only <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>may not use</b> the vestments <b>on Yom Kippur</b> in <b>a different</b> year, but they are fit for an ordinary priest and do not require interment, <b>what is there to say?</b> If the priestly vestments are not an exception to the <i>halakha</i> that there is no prohibition of misuse of consecrated property after the performance of a mitzva, the removal of the ashes remains as the only exception. Why, then, does it not serve as a paradigm for other instances in the Torah? |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and he shall leave them there” | Keritot 6a:11 | The Gemara comments: The fact that the Torah mentions this <i>halakha</i> twice <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the priestly vestments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur require interment. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, what can be said? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the sacred place, <b>and he shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). This phrase <b>teaches that</b> his vestments <b>require interment.</b> Although their use for the mitzva has been completed, it is prohibited to derive benefit from these garments. This is the opinion of the Rabbis. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and shall leave them there” | Meilah 11b:5 | The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the sacred place, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches that</b> the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are unfit for further use, and <b>they require interment.</b> According to their opinion, the answer given by the Gemara works out <b>well.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and he shall leave them there” | Pesachim 26a:12 | The Gemara delineates the two cases: The <i>halakha</i> of the <b>removal of ashes is that which we said.</b> Where is this <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>the priestly garments? As it is written:</b> “And Aharon shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the sacred place, <b>and he shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). The phrase: “And he shall leave them” <b>teaches that they require burial.</b> Although their use for the mitzva has been completed, it is prohibited to derive benefit from them. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and shall leave them there” | Yoma 12b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Dosa follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: That which is written: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches</b> that the garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <b>require interment</b> and may not be put to additional use. <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> It means only that the High Priest <b>may not use them</b> on <b>Yom Kippur</b> in <b>a different</b> year. According to Rabbi Dosa, they may be worn by a common priest during his service, as they do not require interment. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and shall leave them there” | Yoma 24a:2 | The Gemara continues with another <i>baraita</i> connected to this debate. With regard to the garments of the High Priest, the Torah states: “And Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting, and he shall take off the linen garments that he had put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). This verse <b>teaches that</b> the linen garments worn by the High Priest during the Yom Kippur service <b>require storing away,</b> i.e., they may not be used again. <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> They do not have to be stored away, because although they may not be used again by the High Priest on a subsequent Yom Kippur, <b>they are acceptable</b> for use <b>for a common priest. And what,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And shall leave them there,”</b> which implies that they are not to be used again? It means <b>that</b> the High Priest himself <b>may not use them</b> on a <b>subsequent Yom Kippur</b> for service in the Holy of Holies; it does not mean that they may not be used at all. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting” | Yoma 32a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). <b>Why does he come</b> there? He already completed the service in the Sanctuary. <b>He comes only to remove the spoon and the coal pan</b> that he left in the Holy of Holies, <b>as the entire</b> Torah <b>portion</b> in which the Yom Kippur service is discussed <b>was stated in the order</b> in which it is performed in the Temple <b>except for this verse,</b> which should have been written after the sacrifice of the burnt-offering in the following verse. The High Priest does not remove the spoon immediately after he places it in the Holy of Holies. Rather, after placing it there, he emerges and performs certain services outside the Sanctuary and changes his garments again. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the High Priest interrupts the inner rite of the incense to offer his ram and the people’s ram before removing the spoon and the coal pan? |
| Leviticus 16:23 | the verse states: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting and he shall remove the linen garments that he put on” | Yoma 32a:9 | <b>If</b> based on that inference the suggestion arises: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of a priest entering to perform the Temple service, only <b>one sanctification</b> is required, <b>so too here,</b> on Yom Kippur, only <b>one sanctification</b> should be required for the changes of garments throughout all the services of the day. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting and he shall remove the linen garments that he put on”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “That he put on”? Does a person remove</b> any garments <b>other</b> than those <b>that he put on? Rather,</b> this phrase comes <b>to equate removal</b> of garments <b>to donning</b> of garments: <b>Just as donning</b> garments <b>requires sanctification, so too, removal</b> of garments <b>requires sanctification.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and shall leave them there” | Yoma 60a:2 | The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>This</b> works out <b>well</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the sacred place, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches that</b> the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are not fit for further use, and <b>they require interment.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:23 | “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting” | Yoma 70b:12 | § It was taught in the mishna: The High Priest <b>sanctified his hands and feet</b> and entered the Holy of Holies to take out the incense spoon and the coal pan. The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), which is taken to mean that he enters the Holy of Holies. <b>Why does he come?</b> He comes in order <b>to take out the</b> incense <b>spoon and the coal pan</b> |
| Leviticus 16:23 | except for this verse, | Yoma 71a:1 | <b>as the whole portion</b> of the service of the day detailed in Leviticus <b>is written in this order,</b> and the service must be performed in that order, <b>except for this verse,</b> which is stated out of order and is performed only later. The verse detailing his reentry (Leviticus 16:23) is written before the verse detailing the sacrifice of the rams (Leviticus 16:24), but in fact the reentry occurs only after the sacrifice of the rams. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and he shall remove the linen garments | Yoma 71a:6 | <b>Rava said</b> a different proof. <b>The verse states:</b> “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <b>and he shall remove the linen garments</b> which he wore when he went into the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 16:23). Now, <b>the verse does not</b> need to <b>state “which he wore,”</b> as this is obvious; <b>can</b> one <b>remove</b> anything other <b>than what he is wearing? Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “which he wore”?</b> It is referring to <b>those</b> garments <b>which he had already worn</b> previously, removed, and then worn again. It is therefore apparent that this verse occurs at a point when he had already changed out of the white garments and into the golden garments. Perforce, then, it must be out of order. |
| Leviticus 16:23 | and shall leave them there” | Zevachim 46a:8 | The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches that</b> the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are not fit for further use, and <b>they require interment.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:24 | and put on | Yoma 32a:7 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that each and every immersion requires two sanctifications</b> of the hands and the feet? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states:</b> “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <b>and he shall remove</b> the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <b>And he shall wash</b> his flesh in water” (Leviticus 16:23–24). And it says: <b>“And he shall wash</b> his flesh in water in a sacred place <b>and put on</b> his garments” (Leviticus 16:24). This indicates that one sanctifies his hands and feet when he removes garments, and one likewise sanctifies his hands and feet when he dons garments. |
| Leviticus 16:24 | and put on | Yoma 32b:6 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that each and every immersion requires two sanctifications</b> of the hands and the feet? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states:</b> “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <b>and he shall remove</b> the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <b>And he shall wash</b> his flesh in water” (Leviticus 16:23–24). And it says: <b>“And he shall wash</b> his flesh in water in a sacred place <b>and put on</b> his garments” (Leviticus 16:24). The Gemara asks: <b>That is written</b> with regard <b>to immersion.</b> The washing mentioned in this verse is not sanctification of the hands and feet but rather immersion. The Gemara answers: <b>If it is not a matter</b> relating <b>to immersion, which is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“They are sacred garments”</b> (Leviticus 16:4), indicating that every change of clothes requires immersion, then <b>render it a matter</b> relating <b>to sanctification.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:24 | “And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering | Yoma 70b:6 | <b>What is the rationale of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who divide the sacrifice of the seven lambs into two parts? <b>Two verses are written</b> that suggest different times at which the additional offerings are sacrificed: <b>It is written</b> with regard to the additional offerings: <b>“Besides the morning burnt-offering</b> which is the daily burnt-offering you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), implying that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the morning. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> that upon concluding the service of the day: <b>“And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering</b> and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24). As the phrase: “The burnt-offering of the people,” is referring to the additional offerings, this verse implies that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the afternoon. <b>Therefore,</b> in order to fulfill both verses, <b>he performs</b> the sacrifice of <b>some of them here,</b> in the morning, <b>and some of them there,</b> in the afternoon. |
| Leviticus 16:24 | the verse states: “And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering | Yoma 71a:5 | <b>Abaye said:</b> It is clear that the verse detailing the reentry must be out of order, since <b>the verse states: “And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering</b> and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24). This is the first exit stated in the verses and implies that immediately <b>following</b> his <b>first exit</b> from the Holy of Holies, <b>he performs</b> the sacrifice of <b>his ram and the ram of the people</b> without any other interruption. If so, the reentry must occur only afterward. |
| Leviticus 16:24 | Isn’t it written: “And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering | Yoma 71a:7 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila strongly objects to this: Say</b> that the order of the verses can be maintained, and the requisite number of immersions and sanctifications achieved, if <b>he interrupts</b> the services performed in the white garments <b>with the goat</b> whose services <b>are performed outside</b> and are performed in the golden garments. This would provide the additional two immersions and four sanctifications required. The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written: “And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering</b> and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24), which implies that immediately following his first exit he performs the sacrifice of his ram and the ram of the people and the reentry to the Holy of Holies occurs only later. |
| Leviticus 16:25 | the verses it is written: “And he shall burn the fat of the sin-offering upon the altar” | Yoma 71a:8 | The Gemara questions the premise of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is the entire passage</b> really <b>written in order? But</b> among <b>the verses it is written: “And he shall burn the fat of the sin-offering upon the altar”</b>(Leviticus 16:25), <b>and then</b> in a later verse it is written: <b>“And the bull of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering,</b> whose blood was brought to make atonement in the Sanctuary, shall be carried outside the camp; and they shall burn...” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>Yet we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who sees the High Priest reading</b> the Torah <b>does not see the bull and goat that are burned,</b> which are referred to in verse 27, <b>while</b> according to all opinions concerning the order of the day, <b>the portions of the sin-offering</b> to be consumed on the altar, which are mentioned in verse 25, <b>are burned</b> only <b>afterward.</b> Therefore, it is apparent that these verses are also not in order. |
| Leviticus 16:26 | the verse states: “He that dispatched” | Yoma 67b:11 | One <b>might</b> have thought that as soon as <b>he leaves the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> he becomes ritually impure. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He that dispatched”</b> (Leviticus 16:26), to teach that he does not contract impurity until his journey has begun. On the other hand, <b>if</b> the verse had simply stated: <b>He that dispatched,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought he does not become impure <b>until he reaches the cliff.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he that dispatched,”</b> with the inclusive term “and.” <b>How is this</b> to be understood? His garments are rendered impure only <b>when he emerged outside the wall of Jerusalem.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:26 | Azazel shall wash” | Yoma 67b:12 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the verse states: “And he that dispatched the goat to <b>Azazel shall wash”</b> (Leviticus 16:26), which indicates that his garments are not rendered impure <b>until he has reached</b> Azazel, i.e., <b>the cliff. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> His garments are rendered impure only when he pushes the goat from the cliff, as it says: <b>“And he that dispatched the goat to Azazel shall wash his clothes”</b> (Leviticus 16:26), to indicate that <b>he throws it headlong</b> and only then, once he has fulfilled the mitzva, <b>his garments are rendered impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:26 | the verse states: “And the one who sends | Yoma 71a:11 | <b>Abaye said:</b> It is clear that the verse detailing the burning of the remains of the bull is out of order, since <b>the verse states: “And the one who sends</b> the goat to Azazel” (Leviticus 16:26), and then states: <b>“And the one who burns</b> them” (Leviticus 16:28). The repeated use of the phrase “And the one who…” indicates that <b>just as</b> the <b>one who sends</b> the goat to Azazel does so <b>earlier,</b> before the portions of the sin-offering are placed on the altar to be consumed, <b>so too,</b> the <b>one who burns</b> the remains of the bull and goat does so <b>earlier,</b> even though the verse detailing this burning is written after the verse detailing the burning of the portions of the sin-offering. |
| Leviticus 16:27 | “And the bull of the sin-offering and the goat of the sin-offering, | Yoma 50a:2 | The Gemara raises another difficulty by citing a verse: <b>“And the bull of the sin-offering and the goat of the sin-offering,</b> whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, shall be taken outside the camp” (Leviticus 16:27). Once again, the verse proves that even after it has been slaughtered and its blood is brought into the Holy of Holies, the animal is still called a bull. <b>Rav Pappa said: Everyone agrees that</b> when it is intact, <b>with its hide, its flesh, and its excrement,</b> it is called a bull. <b>When they disagree</b> is with regard <b>to</b> the <b>blood. One Sage holds</b> that its <b>blood is called a bull, and one Sage holds</b> that <b>blood</b> alone <b>is not called a bull.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:27 | skin and flesh and dung | Yoma 67b:16 | It was taught in the mishna that the High Priest <b>interwove</b> and bound the bull and the goat together <b>into braids</b> as one mass before taking them to be burned. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He made them <b>like a braid,</b> whose parts are interwoven. <b>It was taught: He would not dissect</b> the bull and goat in the manner of the <b>dissection of the flesh of a burnt-offering,</b> where the animal is skinned and then cut into parts. <b>Rather,</b> he would leave the <b>skin on top of the flesh</b> and would cut the animal into pieces without skinning it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is stated here</b> with regard to the bull and goat, <b>skin and flesh and dung</b> (Leviticus 16:27), <b>and it is stated below,</b> with regard to the bull sin-offerings that are burned, <b>skin and flesh and dung</b> (Leviticus 4:11). |
| Leviticus 16:27 | shall be taken outside the camp and they shall burn” | Yoma 68a:4 | § It was taught in the mishna that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree about the question of <b>at what point the</b> bull and goat <b>render the garments</b> of those who carried them <b>impure. The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> based on the verse: “The bull of the sin-offering and the goat of the sin-offering whose blood was brought in to gain atonement in the sacred place, <b>shall be taken outside the camp and they shall burn”</b> (Leviticus 16:27). |
| Leviticus 16:27 | “And the bull of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, | Yoma 71a:8 | The Gemara questions the premise of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is the entire passage</b> really <b>written in order? But</b> among <b>the verses it is written: “And he shall burn the fat of the sin-offering upon the altar”</b>(Leviticus 16:25), <b>and then</b> in a later verse it is written: <b>“And the bull of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering,</b> whose blood was brought to make atonement in the Sanctuary, shall be carried outside the camp; and they shall burn...” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>Yet we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who sees the High Priest reading</b> the Torah <b>does not see the bull and goat that are burned,</b> which are referred to in verse 27, <b>while</b> according to all opinions concerning the order of the day, <b>the portions of the sin-offering</b> to be consumed on the altar, which are mentioned in verse 25, <b>are burned</b> only <b>afterward.</b> Therefore, it is apparent that these verses are also not in order. |
| Leviticus 16:27 | As the Sages taught | Zevachim 105b:13 | § The mishna teaches: When both <b>these</b> priests <b>and those</b> priests <b>emerged,</b> all of their garments were rendered ritually impure. The Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull and goat that are burned on Yom Kippur: “They shall be carried forth outside the camp” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>There,</b> elsewhere, the verse <b>states</b> that such bulls and goats are burned <b>outside three camps,</b> those of the Tabernacle, the Levites, and the Israelites, whereas <b>here,</b> the verse states only that they are taken outside <b>one camp,</b> i.e., the Tabernacle. This serves <b>to tell you: Once</b> the offering <b>emerges beyond one camp,</b> one who carries it <b>renders</b> his <b>garments impure,</b> as the next verse states: “And he who burns them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28). |
| Leviticus 16:27 | “Outside the camp” | Zevachim 105b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Shimon do with this</b> phrase, stated with regard to the bull and goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“Outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 16:27), given that he holds that the garments do not become impure until the offering is burning? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for</b> that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here: “Outside the camp,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the red heifer: “He shall bring it <b>outside the camp”</b> (Numbers 19:3). <b>Just as here,</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned <b>outside three camps, so too there,</b> the red heifer is burned <b>outside three camps. And just as there,</b> the red heifer is burned <b>east of Jerusalem,</b> since it must be burned “toward the front of the Tent of Meeting” (Numbers 19:4), opposite the entrance of the Temple, which is to its east, |
| Leviticus 16:27 | skin, flesh, and dung, | Zevachim 50a:18 | Rava continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to the bull and goat offered by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, the terms <b>skin, flesh, and dung,</b> in the verse: “And the bull of the sin offering, and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, shall be carried out of the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skin, and their flesh, and their dung” (Leviticus 16:27). |
| Leviticus 16:27 | “And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to atone | Zevachim 83a:5 | Conversely, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is stated here: “To atone”</b> (Leviticus 6:23), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the conclusion of the service on Yom Kippur: <b>“And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to atone</b> in the Sanctuary, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn in the fire” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>Just as there,</b> the phrase “to atone” is referring <b>to</b> the stage <b>when</b> he has already <b>atoned,</b> as the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned after their blood has been sprinkled, <b>so too here,</b> the phrase “to atone” is referring <b>to</b> a situation <b>where</b> he has already <b>atoned,</b> whereas merely bringing the blood into the Sanctuary does not disqualify it. |
| Leviticus 16:28 | impure, | Yoma 67b:14 | <b>He interwove</b> and bound the bull and the goat together <b>into braids</b> as one mass. They were placed in that way upon two poles and carried by four people who <b>took them out to the place</b> designated for <b>burning,</b> outside of Jerusalem. <b>And at what point do the</b> bull and goat <b>render</b> the <b>garments</b> of those who carried them <b>impure,</b> as it is written: “And he who burns them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28)? They render the garments impure <b>from</b> the moment <b>that they emerged outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> They render the garments impure <b>from</b> the moment <b>that the fire has ignited in most of</b> the bull and the goat. |
| Leviticus 16:28 | “And he who burns | Yoma 68b:4 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> It states: <b>“And he who burns</b> them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28), to indicate that only the <b>garments</b> of the one <b>who burns</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <b>are rendered impure, but not</b> the garments of the one <b>who kindles the fire, and not</b> the garments of the one <b>who arranges the pile</b> of wood. <b>And who is the one who burns?

| Leviticus 16:28 | “And the one who burns | Yoma 71a:11 | <b>Abaye said:</b> It is clear that the verse detailing the burning of the remains of the bull is out of order, since <b>the verse states: “And the one who sends</b> the goat to Azazel” (Leviticus 16:26), and then states: <b>“And the one who burns</b> them” (Leviticus 16:28).

| Leviticus 16:28 | and afterward he may come into the camp” | Zevachim 105a:5 | <b>Ravina said: And can you understand</b> this as a proof? The reason that the latter ones’ garments are not rendered impure is that <b>I require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: “And he who burns them shall wash his garments, and bathe his flesh in water, <b>and afterward he may come into the camp”</b> (Leviticus 16:28). <b>And</b> since they have <b>not</b> yet left the camp, they cannot come into it, and therefore they do not contract the impurity described in the verse. |
| Leviticus 16:28 | garments impure, | Zevachim 105b:13 | § The mishna teaches: When both <b>these</b> priests <b>and those</b> priests <b>emerged,</b> all of their garments were rendered ritually impure.

| Leviticus 16:28 | them” | Zevachim 106a:6 | One <b>might</b> have thought that this priest <b>renders</b> his <b>garments impure even after</b> the bull and goat <b>become ash.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he who burns <b>them”</b> (Leviticus 16:28), teaching that <b>they,</b> the whole bull and goat, <b>render garments impure, but they do not render garments impure once they become ash. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The word “them” teaches that <b>they render garments impure,</b> but once <b>the flesh is incinerated they do not render garments impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:29 | Yom Kippur, about which it is written only “statute,” | Menachot 19a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of <b>Yom Kippur, about which it is written only “statute,”</b> as the verse states: “And it shall be a statute for you forever” (Leviticus 16:29), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other? Rather,</b> it must be that Rav meant that wherever <b>either</b> the term <b>law or</b> the term <b>statute</b> is employed, this signifies that the rite is an indispensable requirement. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | a statute | Menachot 27a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse that states with regard to the Yom Kippur service: “And it shall be <b>a statute</b> forever” (Leviticus 16:29), since wherever the term “statute” appears concerning a sacrificial rite, it signifies that the rite is an indispensable requirement. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | you shall afflict your souls” | Nedarim 80b:6 | <b>Rava said:</b> The meaning of the affliction in each case may be learned <b>from the context of the verse. With regard to Yom Kippur, where it is written:</b> “On the tenth of the month <b>you shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:29), the reference is to <b>a matter for which one knows</b> and feels <b>the affliction</b> right <b>now,</b> on Yom Kippur itself, i.e., abstention from food and drink, which is felt within a short period of time. One who abstains from <b>bathing,</b> however, <b>does not know</b> and feel <b>the affliction now,</b> but only later. By contrast, <b>with regard to vows, where it is written: “Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul,</b> her husband may uphold it, or her husband may nullify it” (Numbers 30:14), the reference is to <b>a matter that leads to affliction, and if she does not bathe</b> for an extended period of time, <b>it</b> eventually <b>leads to affliction.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:29 | indicates both men and women? Isn’t it taught | Sukkah 28a:11 | § The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: “The homeborn”</b> is <b>to the exclusion of women. Is that to say that</b> the term <b>homeborn</b> without the definite article <b>indicates both men and women? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to Yom Kippur that it is stated: “And it shall be a statute forever unto you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls and shall do no manner of work, the homeborn, or the stranger that sojourns among you” (Leviticus 16:29). And the term <b>“the homeborn”</b> in that verse comes <b>to include homeborn women, who are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>affliction</b> on Yom Kippur. In that case, the definite article comes to include women. Therefore, <b>apparently,</b> the term homeborn, without the definite article, <b>indicates</b> only <b>men. Rabba said: They are</b> each a <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and the Sages</b> merely <b>supported them with verses</b> as a mnemonic device. Therefore, it is not surprising that the derivations are contradictory. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | “statute” | Yoma 40a:9 | <b>If we say</b> that that the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that if one advanced</b> the <b>applications</b> of the blood <b>of the bull in the Sanctuary</b> made toward the curtain <b>ahead of the applications</b> of the blood <b>of the goat inside</b> the Holy of Holies, then the <i>baraita</i> should not rule that it is valid. The term <b>“statute”</b> (Leviticus 16:29) <b>is written concerning</b> the applications of the blood of the goat inside the Holy of Holies, which implies that their performance is indispensable to any subsequent services. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | you shall afflict your souls” | Yoma 74b:2 | § After clarifying the wording of the mishna, the Gemara brings a halakhic midrash to analyze the mishna’s laws. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And this shall be a statute to you forever: In the seventh month on the tenth day of the month <b>you shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:29). I <b>might</b> have thought that one should <b>sit in the sun or in the cold to suffer</b> and afflict his soul; therefore <b>the</b> continuation of <b>the verse states: “And you shall not do any labor,</b> the home-born, or the stranger that lives among you” (Leviticus 16:29). This teaches that <b>just as</b> prohibited <b>labor is</b> a mitzva that requires one to <b>sit and do nothing,</b> as one is commanded to refrain from action, <b>so too, affliction</b> of one’s <b>soul is also</b> a mitzva requiring one to <b>sit and do nothing.</b> One is not commanded to be proactive in order to afflict his soul. Rather, one must refrain from specified actions such as eating and drinking. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | “You shall afflict your souls” | Yoma 74b:4 | <b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that as the verse states: <b>“You shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:29), I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one</b> must <b>sit in the sun or the cold and be uncomfortable;</b> therefore, <b>the</b> continuation of <b>the verse states: “And you shall not do any labor”</b> (Leviticus 16:29). <b>Just as</b> prohibited <b>labor is something</b> that <b>incurs</b> <i>karet</i> <b>in other circumstances,</b> like Shabbat, <b>so too, affliction</b> relates to acts that <b>in other circumstances incur</b> <i>karet</i>. <b>And what is that</b> circumstance? <b>That is</b> referring to <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i>,</b> which lead to <i>karet</i> if eaten, and which therefore may not be eaten on Yom Kippur. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | the verse states: “You shall afflict” | Yoma 74b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include</b> the categories of <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i>, for which</b> one is punished <b>with <i>karet</i></b> if eaten during the year, <b>but I will not include untithed produce, which does not</b> cause one to incur the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i></b> if eaten. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall afflict”</b> (Leviticus 16:29), and it also states: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:31). The Torah comes to <b>include</b> another affliction of a serious eating prohibition, i.e. untithed produce. |
| Leviticus 16:29 | for you | Yoma 76a:11 | § The mishna taught that as per the five prohibited activities on Yom Kippur it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in eating</b> and in drinking, and in bathing, and in smearing the body with oil, and in wearing shoes, and in conjugal relations. The Gemara asks: <b>These five afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur, to <b>what</b> do they <b>correspond?</b> Where is the Torah source or allusion to them? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> They are based on <b>the five</b> times that the <b>afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur are mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> It is stated: (1) <b>“And on the tenth</b> of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls” (Numbers 29:7); (2) <b>“But on the tenth</b> of this seventh month is the day of atonement, it shall be a holy convocation for you and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27); (3) “It shall be for you <b>a Shabbat of solemn rest,</b> and you shall afflict your souls (Leviticus 23:32); (4) <b>“It is a Shabbat of solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>]</b> for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:31); (5) <b>“And it shall be</b> a statute <b>for you</b> forever, in the seventh month on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:29). |
| Leviticus 16:29 | “statute” is written concerning it: | Zevachim 40a:10 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>“With the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:20), <b>this</b> alludes to <b>the bull of Yom Kippur. To what <i>halakha</i></b> does this statement relate? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> teach that all matters stated with regard to the bull of Yom Kippur are <b>indispensable,</b> this is <b>obvious,</b> since the word <b>“statute” is written concerning it:</b> “And this shall be an everlasting statute to you” (Leviticus 16:29), and there is a principle that <i>halakhot</i> described as statutes are indispensable. |
| Leviticus 16:30 | before the Lord” | Keritot 25b:18 | § The mishna teaches: Those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>provisional guilt offerings</b> are exempt from bringing them after Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> With regard to Yom Kippur <b>the verse states:</b> “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; <b>from all your sins</b> you shall be pure <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). This indicates that <b>Yom Kippur atones</b> for <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> i.e., an uncertain sin that renders one liable to bring a provisional guilt offering. |
| Leviticus 16:30 | from that | Keritot 26a:2 | <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from that</b> which Rabbi Elazar said: With regard to Yom Kippur the verse states: “From all your sins before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:30). This indicates that <b>Yom Kippur atones</b> for <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> i.e., an uncertain sin for which one brings a provisional guilt offering. <b>And from that</b> statement it is derived that <b>it is</b> only for <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware that Yom Kippur atones, but it does not atone</b> for a sin <b>about which</b> the sinner <b>is aware.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:30 | on that day will He atone for you” | Megillah 20b:13 | <b>And</b> daytime is the time for <b>the confession over the bulls, as</b> this is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of <b>atonement</b> in this context and another instance of <b>atonement</b> in the context of <b>Yom Kippur. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to Yom Kippur,</b> the verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin-offering that is his, <b>and atone for himself and for his household”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). <b>The verse speaks of atonement</b> achieved through <b>words,</b> i.e., the atonement here is not referring to the sacrifice of offerings and the sprinkling of blood, but rather to atonement achieved through confession. <b>And the atonement</b> of Yom Kippur <b>is</b> only <b>during the day, as it is written:</b> “For <b>on that day will He atone for you”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). Just as the atonement on Yom Kippur must take place during the day, so must the other cases of atonement, over other bulls brought as sin-offerings, take place during the day. |
| Leviticus 16:30 | I have rebelled before You, I and my family. Please, God, grant atonement, please, for the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions that I have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You, I and my family, as it is written in the Torah of Moses your servant: “For on this day atonement shall be made | Yoma 35b:15 | <b>And this is what he would say</b> in his confession: <b>Please, God, I have sinned, I have done wrong,</b> and <b>I have rebelled before You, I and my family. Please, God, grant atonement, please, for the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions that I have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You, I and my family, as it is written in the Torah of Moses your servant: “For on this day atonement shall be made</b> for you to cleanse you of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:30). <b>And</b> the priests and the people who were in the courtyard <b>respond after he</b> recites the name of God: <b>Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:30 | I have rebelled before You, I and my family and the children of Aaron, your sacred people. Please God, grant atonement, please, for the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions that I have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You, I, and my family, and the children of Aaron, your sacred people, as it is written in the Torah of Moses, your servant: “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you | Yoma 41b:10 | <b>He comes</b> and stands <b>next to his bull a second</b> time, <b>and places his two hands upon it, and confesses. And this is what he would say: Please God, I have sinned, I have done wrong,</b> and <b>I have rebelled before You, I and my family and the children of Aaron, your sacred people. Please God, grant atonement, please, for the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions that I have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You, I, and my family, and the children of Aaron, your sacred people, as it is written in the Torah of Moses, your servant: “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you</b> of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:30). <b>And they,</b> the priests and the people in the Temple courtyard, <b>respond after him</b> upon hearing the name of God: <b>Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:30 | comes over to the scapegoat, places both his hands upon it, and confesses. And he would say as follows: Please, God, Your people, the house of Israel, have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You. Please, God, grant atonement, please, for the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions that they have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You, Your people, the house of Israel, as it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant, saying: “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you of all your sins; before the Lord you shall be purified” | Yoma 66a:10 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Yom Kippur service continues: The High Priest <b>comes over to the scapegoat, places both his hands upon it, and confesses. And he would say as follows: Please, God, Your people, the house of Israel, have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You. Please, God, grant atonement, please, for the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions that they have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You, Your people, the house of Israel, as it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant, saying: “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you of all your sins; before the Lord you shall be purified”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). |
| Leviticus 16:30 | “From all your sins you shall be cleansed before the Lord” | Yoma 85b:8 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya taught</b> that point from the verse: <b>“From all your sins you shall be cleansed before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). For <b>transgressions between a person and God, Yom Kippur atones;</b> however, for <b>transgressions between a person and another, Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases</b> the <b>other</b> person. In conclusion, <b>Rabbi Akiva said: How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified, and Who purifies you?</b> It is <b>your Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified”</b> (Ezekiel 36:25). <b>And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is God”</b> (Jeremiah 17:13). <b>Just as a ritual bath purifies the impure, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, purifies Israel.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:30 | from all your sins” | Yoma 86a:7 | These are the categories: If <b>one violates a positive</b> mitzva <b>and repents, he is forgiven even before he moves</b> from his place, i.e. immediately, <b>as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children,</b> I will heal your backsliding” (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that when one repents he is immediately forgiven. If <b>one violates a prohibition and repents, repentance suspends</b> his punishment <b>and Yom Kippur atones</b> for his sin, <b>as it is stated: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you,</b> to purify you <b>from all your sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). If <b>one commits</b> a transgression that warrants <b><i>karet</i> or</b> a sin punishable by <b>death</b> from the earthly <b>court and</b> then <b>repents, repentance and Yom Kippur suspend</b> his punishment, <b>and suffering absolves</b> and completes the atonement, <b>as it is stated: “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes”</b> (Psalms 89:33). |
| Leviticus 16:31 | and in wearing shoes, and in having relations on Yom Kippur? The verse states: “ Shabbaton ” | Yoma 74a:6 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when it is taught</b> in the mishna using the language of <b>prohibited,</b> it is referring to <b>the other</b> transgressions, which do not incur <i>karet</i>. <b>As Rabba and Rav Yosef taught this in other books</b> of <b>Rav’s school,</b> i.e., the <i>Sifrei</i>, the halakhic midrash on Numbers and Deuteronomy: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in bathing, and in smearing</b> oil on one’s body, <b>and in wearing shoes, and in having relations on Yom Kippur? The verse states: “<i>Shabbaton</i>”</b> (Leviticus 16:31), meaning <b>resting</b> and refraining from certain activities. Therefore, the word prohibit is used with these activities, but they are not punishable by <i>karet</i>. |
| Leviticus 16:31 | “And you shall afflict your souls” | Yoma 74b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include</b> the categories of <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i>, for which</b> one is punished <b>with <i>karet</i></b> if eaten during the year, <b>but I will not include untithed produce, which does not</b> cause one to incur the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i></b> if eaten. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall afflict”</b> (Leviticus 16:29), and it also states: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:31). The Torah comes to <b>include</b> another affliction of a serious eating prohibition, i.e. untithed produce. |
| Leviticus 16:31 | “It is a Shabbat of solemn rest [ shabbaton ] | Yoma 76a:11 | § The mishna taught that as per the five prohibited activities on Yom Kippur it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in eating</b> and in drinking, and in bathing, and in smearing the body with oil, and in wearing shoes, and in conjugal relations. The Gemara asks: <b>These five afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur, to <b>what</b> do they <b>correspond?</b> Where is the Torah source or allusion to them? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> They are based on <b>the five</b> times that the <b>afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur are mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> It is stated: (1) <b>“And on the tenth</b> of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls” (Numbers 29:7); (2) <b>“But on the tenth</b> of this seventh month is the day of atonement, it shall be a holy convocation for you and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27); (3) “It shall be for you <b>a Shabbat of solemn rest,</b> and you shall afflict your souls (Leviticus 23:32); (4) <b>“It is a Shabbat of solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>]</b> for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:31); (5) <b>“And it shall be</b> a statute <b>for you</b> forever, in the seventh month on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:29). |
| Leviticus 16:31 | “Shabbat of solemn rest” | Yoma 81a:21 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> an alternative verbal analogy for the derivation: <b>“Affliction” is stated here,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>and “affliction” is stated later,</b> with regard to a man who rapes a woman: “Because he has afflicted his neighbor’s wife” (Deuteronomy 22:24). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of rape, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning, so too here,</b> in the case of Yom Kippur, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> a different proof: <b>Derive</b> a verbal analogy from the words <b>“Shabbat of solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 16:31) written with regard to Yom Kippur <b>from</b> the words “Shabbat of solemn rest” (Exodus 31:15, 32:5; Leviticus 23:3) written with regard to the weekly Shabbat, which commemorates the <b>Shabbat of Creation. Just as there,</b> in the case of Shabbat, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning, so too here,</b> in the case of Yom Kippur, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:32 | does the verse state: “And the priest who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to serve in his father’s stead shall make the atonement” | Yoma 5a:9 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings <b>throughout the generations,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that failure to serve with multiple garments and anointment for seven days <b>does not invalidate</b> the offering? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “And the priest who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to serve in his father’s stead shall make the atonement”</b> (Leviticus 16:32)? If it comes to teach that all service must be performed by the High Priest, it is already written with regard to the Yom Kippur service that it must be performed by Aaron, the High Priest. |
| Leviticus 16:33 | tanna’im . As it is taught | Chullin 131b:16 | The Gemara responds: <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you</b> that although this <i>baraita</i> is in fact contrary to his opinion, the question of whether or not Levites are called part of the “people” <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the Yom Kippur Temple service: “And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly” (Leviticus 16:33). The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most holy place”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the bull and goat offerings brought on Yom Kippur atone for ritual impurity occurring inside the Holy of Holies. |
| Leviticus 16:33 | as it is written: “And for the priests and for all the people of the congregation he shall atone” | Horayot 6a:14 | <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Abaye: <b>Priests, you say? Priests are different, as they are characterized as a congregation</b> in and of themselves, <b>as it is written: “And for the priests and for all the people of the congregation he shall atone”</b> (Leviticus 16:33). |
| Leviticus 16:33 | “And he shall make atonement for the most holy place [ mikdash hakodesh ]” | Menachot 27b:18 | <b>Rabba bar Ulla said</b> in response: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most holy place [<i>mikdash hakodesh</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), which is interpreted as follows: He will sprinkle the blood to make atonement not specifically on the Ark [<i>hakodesh</i>], but even on <b>the place that is dedicated [<i>hamkudash</i>] for the Ark [<i>lakodesh</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 16:33 | as it is taught | Menachot 92a:9 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: At the end of the passage delineating the Yom Kippur Temple service, the verse states: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar he shall effect atonement; and upon the priests and upon all the people, shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33). <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. <b>“And upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And <b>upon all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:33 | states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests” | Shevuot 13b:12 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would</b> also <b>not achieve atonement through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron, as it is already stated:</b> “Aaron shall bring near <b>his own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), which indicates that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others. And if <b>that is so,</b> then <b>they do not have</b> any means through which to achieve <b>atonement.</b> But <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), <b>we have</b> clearly <b>found that they</b> do <b>have</b> a means of achieving <b>atonement.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:33 | is Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught | Shevuot 13b:5 | <b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed by the mishna? It <b>is Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in exposition of the verse: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and he shall effect atonement upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and upon the priests and upon all the people of the congregation shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33): <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. “<b>Upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And upon <b>all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:33 | The Sages taught: | Yoma 61a:3 | § The mishna states: <b>And similarly in the Sanctuary, and likewise on the golden altar,</b> if the blood spills he must go back and begin that cycle of sprinklings afresh. <b>The Sages taught:</b> “And he shall make atonement for the most sacred place, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly” (Leviticus 16:33). <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most sacred place,” this is the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies; <b>“the Tent of Meeting,” this is the Sanctuary; “altar”</b> is meant <b>as per its plain meaning; “he shall make atonement,” is</b> referring to the second mention of this phrase in the verse, <b>these are the courtyards.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:34 | about Yom Kippur, with regard to which statute is written: | Chullin 24a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that statute is written with regard to</b> a certain matter, <b>we do not learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But</b> what <b>about Yom Kippur, with regard to which statute is written:</b> “And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you” (Leviticus 16:34), <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery renders</b> the goat <b>a sin offering, but a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:34 | statute | Kiddushin 14a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>anywhere that there is</b> a term that <b>precludes</b> another option <b>one cannot learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But there is</b> the case of the designation of the goats on <b>Yom Kippur, as it is written:</b> “The goat upon which the <b>lot</b> came up for the Lord” (Leviticus 16:9), <b>and:</b> “This shall be an everlasting <b>statute</b> to you” (Leviticus 16:34), which indicates that everything stated with regard to the mitzvot of Yom Kippur is critical to the performance of the service of the day. |
| Leviticus 16:34 | and he did as the Lord commanded Moses” | Yoma 2b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that there is indeed a verbal analogy; however, it is not between the red heifer and the inauguration of the priests, but between the term <b>commanded</b> in the context of the inauguration and the term <b>commanded</b> in the context <b>of Yom Kippur, as it is written:</b> “And this will be an everlasting statute for you, to atone for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year; <b>and he did as the Lord commanded Moses”</b> (Leviticus 16:34). In that case, only the sequestering prior to Yom Kippur can be derived. The Gemara rejects this, as a verbal analogy is derived only between functionally similar phrases. <b>One derives commanded that is</b> stated <b>before performance,</b> as in the portion of the heifer, <b>from commanded that is</b> stated <b>before performance</b> in the portion of the inauguration; <b>and one does not derive commanded that is</b> stated <b>after performance</b> in the portion of Yom Kippur <b>from commanded that is</b> stated <b>before performance.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:34 | “statute” | Yoma 42a:7 | The Gemara analyzes Rav’s opinion: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav, what is different</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> that if it is slaughtered by a non-priest it is invalid? As Rav explained, it is different in <b>that,</b> with regard to it, <b>it is written “Elazar” and “statute.”</b> But with regard to <b>the bull</b> of the High Priest <b>it is also written “Aaron”</b> the High Priest (Leviticus 16:11) and <b>“statute”</b> (Leviticus 16:34). Based on Rav’s logic, that indicates that the priest is indispensable. |
| Leviticus 16:34 | “statute” | Yoma 42b:11 | <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>in</b> future <b>generations</b> it can be done even <b>by a common priest,</b> it works out <b>well,</b> since there is no indication to the contrary. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>in</b> future <b>generations</b> it should be done <b>by the High Priest, from where</b> does he derive this requirement? <b>He derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the service of <b>Yom Kippur</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“statute”</b> (Numbers 19:2) written with regard to the red heifer and the word <b>“statute”</b> (Leviticus 16:34) written with regard to the Yom Kippur service: Just as on Yom Kippur the entire service is performed by the High Priest, so too, in future generations the rite of the red heifer must be done entirely by the High Priest. |
| Leviticus 16:34 | once a year” | Yoma 60a:12 | In contrast, <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that the order is indispensable? It is said with regard <b>to actions performed in white garments, whether inside or outside</b> the Sanctuary. <b>However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> those <b>actions performed in golden garments outside</b> the Sanctuary, the regular Temple service and additional services, if the order was altered, <b>what he did is done. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse: “And this shall be an everlasting statute to you,</b> to make atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins <b>once a year”</b> (Leviticus 16:34). |
| Leviticus 16:34 | This is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda: It is written: “This” | Yoma 60b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> the word <b>place</b> is <b>written?</b> The verse merely states “once a year,” which apparently is referring to the order of the service in general but not to a specific place. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous explanation in favor of the following: <b>This is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda: It is written: “This”</b> (Leviticus 16:34), which is a term of restriction and limitation, <b>and it is written: “Once</b> a year” (Leviticus 16:34), another term of restriction. <b>One</b> restriction comes <b>to exclude</b> actions performed <b>in</b> the <b>white garments outside</b> the Sanctuary, meaning that they are not indispensable; <b>and one</b> restriction comes <b>to exclude</b> actions performed <b>in</b> the <b>gold garments.</b> |
| Leviticus 16:34 | when it is written “statute” | Yoma 60b:7 | § <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> With regard to <b>incense that</b> the High Priest <b>scooped before the slaughtering of the bull,</b> it is as though <b>he did nothing.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with</b> whose opinion is this statement? <b>It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As, if</b> you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>say</b> that <b>when it is written “statute”</b> (Leviticus 16:34), a term that indicates that no details may be altered, <b>it is written</b> with regard <b>to actions performed in white garments within</b> the Sanctuary, whereas scooping incense is done outside? |
| Leviticus 17:2 | This is the thing | Nedarim 78a:2 | It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to vows: <b>“This is the thing,” and it is stated elsewhere:</b> “Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>This is the thing</b> which the Lord has commanded, saying” (Leviticus 17:2), <b>in</b> the verse introducing the prohibition against <b>slaughtering</b> offerings <b>outside</b> of the Temple courtyard. <b>Just as with regard to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard, the verse is directed to <b>Aaron and his sons and all</b> of <b>Israel, so too, the portion</b> in the Torah <b>about vows</b> is directed to <b>Aaron and his sons and all</b> of <b>Israel. And just as here,</b> with regard to vows, the verse states: “And Moses spoke to <b>the heads of the tribes</b> of the children of Israel” (Numbers 30:2), <b>so too, there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard, Moses spoke to <b>the heads of the tribes.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:2 | “This is the matter” | Zevachim 107a:14 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that he does not derive it from <b>that</b> verse, as he holds that it is <b>necessary to</b> teach that only <b>one who slaughters</b> a bird offering outside <b>is liable, but</b> one is <b>not liable for pinching its nape</b> outside. <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> from where does he derive that one is exempt if he pinches? <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase at the beginning of the passage about slaughtering outside: <b>“This is the matter”</b> (Leviticus 17:2), which indicates that one is liable only for slaughtering and not for any other method of killing. |
| Leviticus 17:2 | the verse states: “This is the matter” | Zevachim 107a:16 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even one who pinches</b> the nape of a bird offering outside would be liable. <b>And</b> there <b>is a logical inference</b> to support this: <b>If</b> with regard to the <b>slaughter</b> of a bird offering, <b>which is not</b> the valid <b>method of preparation inside</b> the Temple, one is nevertheless <b>liable</b> if he did it outside, then with regard to <b>pinching</b> the nape of a bird offering, <b>which is</b> the valid <b>method of preparation inside</b> the Temple, <b>is it not logical that</b> one <b>is liable</b> if he did it outside? To counter this, <b>the verse states: “This is the matter”</b> (Leviticus 17:2), which indicates one is liable only for slaughtering, not for any other method of killing. |
| Leviticus 17:2 | the children of Israel” | Zevachim 116b:3 | § <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that discussed the sacrifice of offerings before the construction of the Tabernacle: <b>And today gentiles are permitted to do so,</b> i.e., to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple courtyard, despite the fact that this is forbidden for the Jews. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verses that prohibit the slaughter of offerings outside the Temple: <b>“Speak</b> to Aaron, and to his sons, and <b>to</b> all <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 17:2). This indicates that only <b>Jews are commanded with regard to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple, <b>but gentiles are not commanded with regard to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple. |
| Leviticus 17:3 | from: “Or that slaughters | Zevachim 107a:13 | Rabbi Yishmael derives the liability for sprinkling part of the blood of an offering outside the Temple courtyard from the verse “Blood shall be imputed to that man.” The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva, what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“Blood shall be imputed</b> to that man”? He expounds it <b>to include</b> liability for the <b>slaughter of a bird</b> offering outside the courtyard. One is liable despite the fact that inside the Temple, a bird is sacrificed by pinching the nape of its neck, not by slaughtering it. <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yishmael, he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from: “Or that slaughters</b> it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). |
| Leviticus 17:3 | that slaughters | Zevachim 107a:15 | Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Any man of the house of Israel <b>that slaughters</b> an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that slaughters it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived liability <b>only</b> for one who <b>slaughters an animal</b> offering outside; <b>from where do we</b> derive that one is liable if he <b>slaughtered a bird</b> offering outside? <b>The verse states: “Or that slaughters,”</b> to include liability for slaughtering a bird. |
| Leviticus 17:3 | The Sages taught | Zevachim 107b:10 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Any man of the house of Israel that slaughters an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that slaughters it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). Based on the first part of the verse: “That slaughters…<b>in the camp,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who slaughters a burnt offering in the south</b> of the courtyard, instead of in the north, where it should be slaughtered, <b>will be liable,</b> as he has slaughtered it outside the area in which it should be slaughtered. To counter this, <b>the</b> next part of the <b>verse states:</b> “That slaughters it <b>outside the camp,”</b> indicating that liability is incurred only for slaughtering an offering outside the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 17:3 | as the verse states: “Any man [ ish ish ] | Zevachim 108a:22 | The Gemara explains: It <b>is different there,</b> with regard to slaughtering, <b>as the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the house of Israel…that slaughters it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). The amplification indicated by the phrase “<i>ish ish</i>” teaches that one is liable even for slaughtering for the sake of an ordinary purpose. The Gemara challenges: But <b>also with regard to offering up it is written: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the house of Israel…that offers up a burnt offering” (Leviticus 17:8). The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> amplification <b>is necessary to</b> teach that <b>two people who offered up a limb</b> of an offering together outside the courtyard are <b>liable.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:3 | “Any man [ ish ish ]” | Zevachim 108b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yosei, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> he holds that nothing is to be derived from the phrase <b>“<i>ish ish</i>”</b> written with regard to offering up, as he holds that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> then <b>also</b> with regard to <b>that</b> phrase: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 17:3), written with regard to slaughtering, since he holds that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> he should not derive any <i>halakhot</i> from it. <b>But</b> if so, <b>from where</b> does he derive <b>that one who slaughters</b> outside <b>for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose is <b>liable?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“Blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:4), which teaches that <b>even one who slaughters for</b> the sake of an ordinary <b>man</b> is liable. |
| Leviticus 17:3 | the verse states | Zevachim 115a:3 | To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to slaughter outside the courtyard: “Whatever person there be of the house of Israel that slaughters an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that slaughters it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). <b>“Ox”</b> indicates <b>in any case</b> of an ox, <b>“lamb”</b> indicates <b>in any case</b> of a lamb, and <b>“goat”</b> indicates <b>in any case</b> of a goat, that one is liable for slaughtering them outside the courtyard; <b>while a sin offering</b> was <b>omitted</b> from the cases in the <i>baraita</i> where one who slaughters the offering outside the courtyard is liable. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | “It shall be considered blood for that [ hahu ] man; he has spilled blood” | Kiddushin 43a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent that applies to other cases, <b>but according to the one who said</b> that two verses do <b>teach</b> a precedent, <b>what can be said?</b> Why not derive from the case of misuse of consecrated property and that of slaughter or sale that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One reveals</b> in the Torah that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression <b>in</b> the case of an offering <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple, as it states: <b>“It shall be considered blood for that [<i>hahu</i>] man; he has spilled blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:4). The emphasis of “that man” teaches that <b>he</b> is liable for his actions, <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> liable for the actions of <b>his agent.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:4 | “And that [ hahu ] man shall be cut off | Kiddushin 43a:5 | The Gemara asks: But <b>before deriving</b> that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression <b>from</b> the case of offerings <b>slaughtered outside, let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from these</b> other cases, i.e., misuse of consecrated property and slaughter or sale, where the <i>halakha</i> is that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One again writes</b> in that same verse in connection to the prohibition of slaughtering offerings outside the Temple: <b>“And that [<i>hahu</i>] man shall be cut off</b> from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from the emphasis of the word <i>hahu</i> written in this part of the verse <b>is not needed for</b> this <b>matter itself,</b> since the verse already taught that he is liable only for his own act and not for that of his agent, <b>apply it to the matter of the entire Torah,</b> so that one is held liable only for one’s own actions and not for those of an agent. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | one camp, | Sanhedrin 42b:9 | The Gemara challenges this derivation of the <i>halakha</i> governing one who is sentenced to be stoned from the <i>halakha</i> governing the burning of bulls brought as sin-offerings. Perhaps the place of stoning <b>should be learned from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>offerings slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard, about which the verse also uses the expression “outside the camp” (see Leviticus 17:3). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard, these words mean: <b>Outside</b> only <b>one camp,</b> the camp of the Divine Presence, corresponding to the Temple, as the next verse states: “And he did not bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:4), i.e., the camp of the Divine Presence, <b>so too here,</b> the condemned man should be stoned <b>outside one camp.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:4 | the verse states: “And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” | Temurah 13a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore <b>the verse states: “And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it”</b> (Leviticus 17:4), to teach that <b>for any</b> item <b>that</b> is fit to <b>come to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,</b> i.e., that is fit to be sacrificed, <b>one is liable for it due to</b> the prohibition against <b>slaughtering offerings outside</b> of the Temple courtyard. <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>for any</b> animal <b>that</b> is <b>not</b> fit to <b>come to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, one is not liable for it due to</b> the prohibition against <b>slaughtering offerings outside</b> of the Temple courtyard. <b>Evidently,</b> as a verse is necessary to exclude items consecrated for Temple maintenance, such items <b>are</b> generally <b>called an offering,</b> contrary to the first <i>baraita</i> cited. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | But isn’t it taught | Temurah 6b:15 | The Gemara interjects: <b>And</b> does the term: <b>“Unto the Lord,”</b> serve <b>to include</b> the scapegoat? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah condemns one who slaughters an offering outside the Temple “and has not brought it unto the door of the Tent of Meeting, to present it as an offering unto the Lord” (Leviticus 17:4)? <b>If</b> the verse had stated only <b>“offering,” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that one is liable <b>even</b> for slaughtering animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance</b> outside the Temple, <b>for they are</b> also <b>called an offering, as it is stated: “And we have brought the Lord’s offering,</b> what every man has found: Articles of gold” (Numbers 31:50). |
| Leviticus 17:4 | to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Temurah 6b:16 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> has not brought it <b>to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:4). This teaches that <b>one is liable</b> only <b>for</b> sacrificing an animal <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed within the <b>entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b> or the Temple <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>slaughtering</b> offerings <b>outside</b> the Temple. But <b>one is not liable for</b> sacrificing an animal <b>not fit to</b> be sacrificed within the <b>entrance of the Tent of Meeting due to</b> the prohibition of <b>slaughtering</b> offerings <b>outside</b> the Temple. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | to the entrance | Temurah 6b:18 | <b>Rava said: There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> discussing offerings slaughtered outside the Temple, the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from the context of the verse.</b> The verse states: <b>“And</b> has not brought it <b>to the entrance</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:4), which serves <b>to include</b> any unblemished animal. Therefore, the following term: <b>“Unto the Lord,”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> certain exceptions to the rule. <b>Here, where</b> the verse states <b>“fire”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which serves <b>to exclude</b> animals not burned on the altar from the prohibition, the term: <b>“Unto the Lord,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> exceptions to that principle. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | the verse states: “And has not brought it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” | Yoma 63b:1 | <b>If</b> it would have mentioned just the word <b>offering, I</b> would <b>derive</b> that one is liable <b>even</b> for slaughtering animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance</b> outside the Temple, <b>which are</b> also <b>called offering, as it is stated: “And we have brought the Lord’s offering,</b> what every man has found: Articles of gold, armlets, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and pendants” (Numbers 31:50). Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And has not brought it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:4), to teach that with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed within <b>the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b> or the Temple, <b>one is liable for</b> slaughtering <b>it outside</b> the Temple. Conversely, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>that is not fit</b> to be sacrificed within <b>the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, one is not liable for</b> slaughtering <b>it outside</b> the Temple. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | “Blood shall be imputed | Zevachim 107a:7 | § The Gemara considers the source for other prohibitions. <b>And</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (110a): <b>One who sprinkles part of</b> the <b>blood</b> of an offering, e.g., if he sprinkles one sprinkling instead of four, <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, is <b>liable; from where do we</b> derive this? The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to one who slaughters outside the Temple courtyard: <b>“Blood shall be imputed</b> to that man, he has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). This serves <b>to include</b> liability for <b>one who sprinkles</b> sacrificial blood outside the Temple courtyard; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is derived from the verse: “Any man…that offers up a burnt offering <b>or sacrifice”</b> (Leviticus 17:8). The term “or” serves <b>to include</b> liability for <b>one who sprinkles</b> blood outside the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 107b:14 | Based on this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Ulla says: One who slaughters</b> an offering <b>on the roof of</b> the <b>Sanctuary</b> is <b>liable</b> for slaughtering outside the Temple courtyard, <b>since</b> the roof is an area that is <b>not fit for the slaughter of any offering. Rava objects to this: If so, let the verse write</b> only: “Or that slaughters it <b>outside the camp,” and</b> it would <b>not</b> be <b>necessary</b> to write: “And he did not bring it <b>to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:4). <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to also write: “And he did not bring it <b>to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”?</b> Is it <b>not to exclude the roof of</b> the Sanctuary, as in the Temple the Sanctuary corresponded to the Tent of Meeting? Although the roof is an area that is not fit for slaughtering any offering, one should not be liable for slaughtering there since the offering was nevertheless brought to the Tent of Meeting. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | that | Zevachim 108a:23 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, here too,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the phrase “<i>ish ish</i>” <b>should be</b> used <b>to</b> teach that <b>two</b> people <b>who grasped a knife and</b> together <b>slaughtered</b> an offering outside the courtyard are <b>liable,</b> contrary to the ruling of the mishna. Why are the two parallel phrases expounded in different ways? The Gemara explains: <b>It is different there,</b> with regard to slaughtering, <b>as the verse states:</b> “And <b>that</b> man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). The term “that man,” which is in the singular, indicates that only <b>one</b> who acts alone is liable, <b>but not two</b> who act together. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | are written: | Zevachim 108b:2 | The Gemara explains: With regard to slaughtering outside, <b>two</b> instances of the term <b>“that</b> man” <b>are written:</b> “Blood shall be imputed to that man, he has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). One instance teaches that only one who acts with intent is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, and the other teaches that only one who acts alone is liable. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | “Blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood” | Zevachim 108b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yosei, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> he holds that nothing is to be derived from the phrase <b>“<i>ish ish</i>”</b> written with regard to offering up, as he holds that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> then <b>also</b> with regard to <b>that</b> phrase: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 17:3), written with regard to slaughtering, since he holds that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> he should not derive any <i>halakhot</i> from it. <b>But</b> if so, <b>from where</b> does he derive <b>that one who slaughters</b> outside <b>for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose is <b>liable?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“Blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:4), which teaches that <b>even one who slaughters for</b> the sake of an ordinary <b>man</b> is liable. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | raises a contradiction | Zevachim 113b:17 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “To present it as an offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 17:4), and it is derived from the word “offering” that one who slaughters non-sacred animals inside the Temple is not liable. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Or</b> perhaps from the word <b>“offering” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the prohibition against slaughtering outside the Temple applies <b>even</b> to items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance, as</b> they too <b>are called offerings, as it is stated</b> with regard to the spoils of the war against Midian: <b>“And we have brought the Lord’s offering,</b> what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord” (Numbers 31:50). These were certainly not items consecrated for the altar. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | the verse states: “And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” | Zevachim 113b:18 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it”</b> (Leviticus 17:4), which teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>that which is fit to come to</b> the entrance of the <b>Tent of Meeting,</b> i.e., is fit to be sacrificed. <b>Excluded</b> are items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance, which are not fit</b> for sacrifice. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | copulated with a person, or an animal that was the object of bestiality, | Zevachim 113b:22 | § The mishna teaches that with regard to <b>an animal that</b> actively <b>copulated with a person, or an animal that was the object of bestiality,</b> or another disqualified offering such as an animal that was designated for idol worship, or one that was worshipped: If one sacrificed it outside the Temple courtyard, he is exempt. This is because with regard to the prohibition against slaughtering outside, the Torah states: “He did not bring it, to present it as an offering to the Lord before the Tabernacle of the Lord” (Leviticus 17:4), which teaches that there is no liability for slaughtering outside the Temple courtyard an animal that is not fit to be sacrificed. |
| Leviticus 17:4 | to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 115a:9 | To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to one who slaughters outside the courtyard: <b>“And</b> has not brought it <b>to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:4), which teaches that for <b>any</b> sacrifice <b>that is unfit to be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, one is not liable for</b> slaughtering it outside the courtyard. <b>But a guilt offering</b> whose time has not yet arrived was <b>omitted</b> by the <i>tanna</i>, from which it can be inferred that one who slaughters a guilt offering outside the courtyard is liable. |
| Leviticus 17:5 | as it is stated: “In order that the children of Israel shall bring their sacrifices, which they slaughter | Avodah Zarah51b:5 | This is apparent, <b>as it is stated: “In order that the children of Israel shall bring their sacrifices, which they slaughter</b> upon the open field, that they shall bring them to the Lord, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:5). The phrase: “Their sacrifices, which they slaughter,” is interpreted as referring to offerings <b>that I have previously permitted you</b> to slaughter on private altars. This verse teaches that those offerings may now be sacrificed only inside the Tabernacle. The phrase <b>“upon the open field” teaches that</b> in the case of <b>anyone who slaughters</b> an offering <b>on</b> a private <b>altar during a period when the prohibition of</b> sacrificing on private <b>altars</b> is in effect, even if he sacrifices the offering to God, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as if he is slaughtering</b> it <b>upon the open field</b> in idolatrous worship. |
| Leviticus 17:5 | “That they may bring them to the Lord” | Temurah 12a:3 | Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Do we read</b> the verse: <b>“That they may bring them to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:5), as applying <b>to</b> this case? The full passage reads: “Any man of the house of Israel who shall slaughter a bull, or a lamb, or a goat…and has not brought it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting…that man shall be cut off from among his people. To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them to the Lord, to the door of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:3–5). The passage indicates that the prohibition against slaughtering offerings outside the Temple applies only to those offerings that are fit to be slaughtered inside. But this fetus is not fit to be slaughtered at all until it is born. |
| Leviticus 17:5 | as it is stated: “In order that the children of Israel shall bring their sacrifices, which they slaughter | Zevachim 106b:3 | This is apparent, <b>as it is stated: “In order that the children of Israel shall bring their sacrifices, which they slaughter</b> upon the open field, that they shall bring them to the Lord, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:5). The phrase “their sacrifices, which they slaughter” is interpreted as referring to <b>offerings that I have previously permitted for you</b> to slaughter on private altars. This verse teaches that those offerings may now be sacrificed only inside the Tabernacle. The phrase <b>“upon the open field” tells you</b> that in the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an offering on a private altar <b>during a period when the prohibition against</b> sacrificing on private <b>altars</b> is in effect, even if he sacrifices the offering to God, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as if he sacrificed</b> it <b>upon the open field</b> in idolatrous worship. |
| Leviticus 17:5 | said to him: It is written: “That they may bring them to the Lord” | Zevachim 26a:13 | Shmuel <b>said to him: It is written: “That they may bring them to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:5), indicating that the offering may not be slaughtered <b>unless all of it is inside.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:5 | “That they may bring them to the Lord” | Zevachim 26a:21 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the priest was <b>inside and his fringes,</b> i.e., his hair, were <b>outside,</b> and he collected the blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Did you not say</b> that the verse: <b>“That they may bring them to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:5), indicates that an offering may not be slaughtered <b>unless all of it comes inside? Here, too,</b> the verse states with regard to the priests: <b>“When they go into the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Exodus 28:43), indicating that the priest may not perform rites <b>unless all of him comes into the Tent of Meeting.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:6 | “For a pleasing aroma | Menachot 26a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan himself says:</b> The verse states: <b>“For a pleasing aroma</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 17:6). This teaches that the blood is sprinkled whenever <b>anything that you offer up</b> on the altar <b>for a pleasing aroma</b> remains. This includes anything burned on the altar. |
| Leviticus 17:6 | and he shall make the fat smoke for a pleasing aroma to the Lord” | Menachot 26a:9 | The Gemara returns to its discussion of the <i>halakha</i> that if only an olive-bulk of the fat remains, the priest sprinkles the blood of the offering. <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> there are those who <b>determined</b> that <b>it</b> was stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: The verse states:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood against the altar of the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting, <b>and he shall make the fat smoke for a pleasing aroma to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:6). This verse never mentions the meat, but only the <b>fat,</b> indicating that the blood is sprinkled <b>even if there is no</b> ritually pure <b>meat,</b> but only fat. |
| Leviticus 17:6 | and he shall make the fat smoke for a satisfying aroma to the Lord” | Pesachim 79a:8 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that if only the <b>fat</b> remains, one may sprinkle the blood of the offering? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> there are those who <b>determined</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> was stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: As the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting; <b>and he shall make the fat smoke for a satisfying aroma to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:6). This verse indicates that one may sprinkle the blood if the <b>fat</b> remains pure <b>although there is no</b> pure <b>meat.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:6 | at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 108b:18 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the reason of Rabbi Shimon is as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the verse states: “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the <b>altar</b> of the Lord <b>at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:6). From here it is apparent that only in the Sanctuary is there a requirement for an altar, <b>but</b> a specifically erected <b>altar is not</b> required in order to offer up <b>on</b> a private <b>altar</b> during periods when it is permitted to do so. <b>Therefore, one who offered up</b> outside the courtyard <b>on a rock or on a stone</b> is <b>liable.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:6 | “And the priest shall dash the blood against the altar of the Lord | Zevachim 118a:3 | The Gemara challenges: But the fact that <b>a non-priest</b> is qualified to perform the sacrificial service on a private altar is <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And the priest shall dash the blood against the altar of the Lord</b> at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:6). The verse indicates that service at a great public altar may be performed only by a priest, from which it is inferred that the service on a private altar may be performed by a non-priest as well. |
| Leviticus 17:6 | as it is written: “And the priest shall sprinkle | Zevachim 119b:18 | The Gemara continues detailing the distinctions between great public altars and small private altars: <b>And a priest</b> is required only at a public altar, <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall sprinkle</b> the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:6). Priestly <b>service vestments</b> are required only at a public altar, as it is written: “And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons when they go into the Tent of Meeting or when they come near to the altar <b>to minister in the sacred place”</b> (Exodus 28:43). |
| Leviticus 17:6 | for an aroma pleasing to the Lord” | Zevachim 119b:19 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>service vessels,</b> it is written: “And they shall take all the service vessels <b>wherewith they serve in the sacred place”</b> (Numbers 4:12). With regard <b>to a pleasing aroma,</b> i.e., that limbs that had previously been roasted off the altar should not be placed upon the altar, it is required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the priest shall make the fat smoke <b>for an aroma pleasing to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:6). |
| Leviticus 17:7 | as it is stated: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore to the se’irim | Avodah Zarah51a:22 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning one who slaughters an animal</b> as an offering <b>to Mercury that he is liable</b> even though it is not typically worshipped in this manner? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore to the <i>se’irim</i></b> after whom they go astray; this shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations” (Leviticus 17:7). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of</b> prohibiting the worship of an idol in <b>its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> it must apply to another matter. The verse cannot be referring to idols that are typically worshipped by slaughtering offerings, <b>as</b> this prohibition <b>is written</b> in the verse: “And lest you inquire after their gods, saying: <b>How do these nations serve their gods?</b> Even so will I do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30). One must therefore <b>apply</b> the verse to the <b>matter of</b> prohibiting the worship of an idol in <b>an atypical manner.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:7 | The verse states: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore | Avodah Zarah51b:6 | The verse continues: <b>“That they shall bring them to the Lord.” This</b> is <b>a positive mitzva</b> to sacrifice even offerings that were consecrated before the Tabernacle was erected in the wilderness. <b>And from where</b> is it derived that there is <b>a prohibition</b> against sacrificing them outside the Tabernacle? <b>The verse states: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore</b> to the <i>se’irim</i> after whom they go astray; this shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations” (Leviticus 17:7). |
| Leviticus 17:7 | the verse states: “This shall be to them an eternal statute, | Avodah Zarah51b:7 | One <b>might</b> have thought that sacrificing these offerings outside the Tabernacle <b>would be punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> as this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to offerings consecrated after the Tabernacle was consecrated. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This shall be to them an eternal statute,</b> throughout their generations” (Leviticus 17:7). One can infer from this verse that <b>this,</b> the punishment for transgressing a positive mitzva and a prohibition, applies <b>to them, but no other</b> punishment applies <b>to them.</b> In any event, the <i>baraita</i> interprets the verse: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore to the <i>se’irim</i>,” as prohibiting sacrificing to God on private altars, not as Rabbi Elazar interpreted it, as prohibiting the worship of an idol in an atypical manner. |
| Leviticus 17:7 | as it is written: “Throughout their generations” | Bava Batra120a:11 | <b>Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> then concerning the phrase <b>“this is the matter”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> an offering <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Tabernacle (see Leviticus 17:2–3), <b>so too,</b> is it the <i>halakha</i> <b>that it will not be practiced except in this generation?</b> Certainly that is not so, as that prohibition applies in all generations. What is the difference between the two passages? Rav Ashi answered: It <b>is different there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, <b>as it is written: “Throughout their generations”</b> (Leviticus 17:7), indicating that the prohibition is in effect in all generations. |
| Leviticus 17:7 | sacrifices an animal to Mercury is liable? As it is stated: “And they shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the satyrs” | Sanhedrin 61a:8 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan’s interpretation of the verses appears to contradict <b>that which Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> one who <b>sacrifices an animal to Mercury is liable? As it is stated: “And they shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the satyrs”</b> (Leviticus 17:7). |
| Leviticus 17:7 | “And they shall not slaughter anymore | Zevachim 106a:14 | <b>But</b> for the <b>slaughtering,</b> why is one liable? <b>Granted</b> that the <b>punishment</b> is stated in the Torah, <b>as it is written:</b> “Any man…that slaughters it outside the camp, <b>and he did not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,</b> to sacrifice an offering to the Lord, before the Tabernacle of the Lord…that man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:3–4). <b>But from where do we</b> derive its <b>prohibition?</b> One is liable only in a case where the Torah specifies both the prohibition and the punishment. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And they shall not slaughter anymore</b> their offerings to the <i>se’irim</i> after whom they go astray” (Leviticus 17:7). |
| Leviticus 17:7 | “And they shall not slaughter” | Zevachim 106a:16 | <b>Rabba said:</b> Both <i>halakhot</i> can be derived from the same verse. <b>Read into</b> the verse as though it stops after the phrase: <b>“And they shall not slaughter”</b> (Leviticus 17:7), and relates to the prohibition against slaughtering outside the Temple courtyard, which was mentioned in the previous verses. <b>And</b> also <b>read into</b> the verse as relating to the verse’s continuation: <b>And not anymore</b> their offerings to the <i>se’irim</i>, which serves as the source for the prohibition against sacrificing offerings to false deities. |
| Leviticus 17:7 | The verse states: “And they shall not slaughter anymore | Zevachim 106b:4 | The verse continues: <b>“That they shall bring them to the Lord.” This</b> is <b>a positive mitzva</b> to sacrifice in the Tabernacle even offerings that were consecrated before the Tabernacle was erected. <b>From where</b> is it derived that there is <b>a prohibition</b> against sacrificing them outside the Tabernacle? <b>The verse states: “And they shall not slaughter anymore</b> their offerings to the <i>se’irim</i> after whom they go astray; this shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations” (Leviticus 17:7). |
| Leviticus 17:7 | the verse states: “This shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations” | Zevachim 106b:5 | One <b>might</b> have thought that sacrificing these offerings outside the Tabernacle <b>would be punishable</b> by <b><i>karet</i>,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to offerings consecrated after the Tabernacle was erected. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations”</b> (Leviticus 17:7). One can infer from this verse that <b>this,</b> the punishment for transgressing a positive mitzva and a prohibition, applies <b>to them, but no other</b> punishment applies <b>to them.</b> It is clear from this <i>baraita</i> that the verse “And they shall not slaughter anymore” is used to teach about the prohibition against sacrificing outside the Tabernacle those offerings that were consecrated while there was permission to sacrifice on private altars, and not those offerings that were consecrated while it was prohibited to sacrifice on private altars. |
| Leviticus 17:8 | or sacrifice” | Sanhedrin 34b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that when the verse states: “Whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offers a burnt-offering <b>or sacrifice”</b> (Leviticus 17:8), it serves <b>to include one who sprinkles</b> blood of consecrated offerings outside the Tent of Meeting. Rav Ashi explains: <b>What do the two</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>include</b> by means of these explanations? One who performs <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood outside the Tent of Meeting. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>brings</b> proof for <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“blood shall be imputed,” and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>brings</b> proof for <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“or sacrifice.”</b> This is an example of one explanation from two different verses. |
| Leviticus 17:8 | verse states: “And to them [ va’alehem ] you shall say” | Zevachim 107a:3 | <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The beginning of that <b>verse states: “And to them [<i>va’alehem</i>] you shall say”</b> (Leviticus 17:8). The term “<i>alehem</i>,” to them, written with the letter <i>alef</i>, is phonetically similar to the term <i>alehem</i>, about them, written with the letter <i>ayin</i>. Therefore, the verse can be understood as saying: <b>About that which is</b> written in the <b>adjacent</b> passage <b>you shall say.</b> The preceding passage discusses offerings that were slaughtered outside the Temple, so the liability for offering up outside the Temple mentioned in this verse is also referring to those offerings. |
| Leviticus 17:8 | or sacrifice” | Zevachim 107a:7 | § The Gemara considers the source for other prohibitions. <b>And</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (110a): <b>One who sprinkles part of</b> the <b>blood</b> of an offering, e.g., if he sprinkles one sprinkling instead of four, <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, is <b>liable; from where do we</b> derive this? The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to one who slaughters outside the Temple courtyard: <b>“Blood shall be imputed</b> to that man, he has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). This serves <b>to include</b> liability for <b>one who sprinkles</b> sacrificial blood outside the Temple courtyard; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is derived from the verse: “Any man…that offers up a burnt offering <b>or sacrifice”</b> (Leviticus 17:8). The term “or” serves <b>to include</b> liability for <b>one who sprinkles</b> blood outside the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 17:8 | also with regard to offering up it is written: “Any man [ ish ish ] | Zevachim 108a:22 | The Gemara explains: It <b>is different there,</b> with regard to slaughtering, <b>as the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the house of Israel…that slaughters it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). The amplification indicated by the phrase “<i>ish ish</i>” teaches that one is liable even for slaughtering for the sake of an ordinary purpose. The Gemara challenges: But <b>also with regard to offering up it is written: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the house of Israel…that offers up a burnt offering” (Leviticus 17:8). The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> amplification <b>is necessary to</b> teach that <b>two people who offered up a limb</b> of an offering together outside the courtyard are <b>liable.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:8 | the verse states: “Any man [ ish ish ]… | Zevachim 108b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> <i>halakha</i> is alluded to when <b>the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]…</b>that offers up a burnt offering or sacrifice” (Leviticus 17:8)? The verse teaches that <b>two people who grasped a limb</b> of an offering <b>and offered</b> it <b>up</b> together outside the courtyard are <b>liable.</b> It is necessary for the verse to teach this, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought to say: <b>Could this not be</b> derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If</b> with regard to slaughtering outside the courtyard, <b>one who slaughters for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose is <b>liable,</b> and nevertheless, <b>two who grasped a knife and</b> together <b>slaughtered</b> an offering are <b>exempt,</b> then with regard to offering up outside the courtyard, where <b>one who offers up for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose is <b>exempt, is it not logical that two who grasped</b> a limb and offered it up will also be <b>exempt?</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states “<i>ish ish</i>”</b> to teach that they are liable for offering up together; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:8 | The verse states: “That sacrifices a burnt offering or sacrifice” | Zevachim 115b:5 | <b>The verse states: “That sacrifices a burnt offering or sacrifice”</b> (Leviticus 17:8). <b>Just as sacrificing is the conclusion of</b> the sacri-ficial <b>service, so too, any</b> rite <b>that is the conclusion of</b> a sacrificial <b>service</b> is included. All of these are excluded from the prohibition, as there are rites that follow them. |
| Leviticus 17:8 | “And to them [ va’alehem ] you shall say” | Zevachim 119b:8 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that</b> immediately following the Torah’s description of an offering that was consecrated during a period of the permitting of private altars <b>the verse states</b> the penalty for sacrificing outside the designated area: <b>“And to them [<i>va’alehem</i>] you shall say”</b> (Leviticus 17:8). The term “<i>alehem</i>,” to them, the first letter of which is the letter <i>aleph</i>, is phonetically similar to the term: <i>Alehem</i>, about them, the first letter of which is the letter <i>ayin</i>. Therefore, the verse can be understood to mean: <b>About that which is</b> written in the <b>adjacent</b> passage <b>you shall say.</b> The preceding passage discusses offerings that were slaughtered outside the Temple, so although there is no penalty of <i>karet</i> for their slaughter, one is liable for <i>karet</i> for sacrificing them upon a private altar. |
| Leviticus 17:9 | to sacrifice it | Zevachim 107a:10 | <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> why does he not derive that <i>halakha</i> from the term “it”? The Gemara answers: According to him, <b>that</b> term <b>is necessary</b> as the source for the <i>halakha</i> that one <b>is liable for</b> offering up <b>a complete</b> animal, <b>but</b> one <b>is not liable for</b> offering up <b>an incomplete</b> animal. The term “it” indicates an animal in its entirety. <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva, he derives</b> this <b>from</b> the repetition of “it” in the continuation of the verse: “He will not bring it…<b>to sacrifice it</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 17:9). |
| Leviticus 17:9 | he will not bring it | Zevachim 107a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>to divide</b> them into two cases? <b>He derives it from</b> the next verse: “And <b>he will not bring it</b> to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:9). The term “it” is written in the singular to indicate that one is liable even if he offered up only one of them. |
| Leviticus 17:9 | to the Lord” | Zevachim 108a:21 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the first <i>halakha</i> of the mishna: <b>What is different</b> about <b>one who offers up</b> outside <b>for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose, <b>that he is exempt? As it is written:</b> “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to sacrifice it <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:9), which indicates that the liability applies only to offering up for the sake of the Lord. The Gemara questions this: But <b>with regard to slaughtering, isn’t it also written:</b> “Or that slaughters it outside the camp, and he did not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice an offering <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:3–4)? |
| Leviticus 17:9 | if so, also with regard to offering up, isn’t it written: “That | Zevachim 108a:24 | The Gemara challenges: But <b>if so, also with regard to offering up, isn’t it written: “That</b> man shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 17:9)? Why isn’t that term also expounded to teach that only one who acts alone is liable? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> term <b>is necessary</b> |
| Leviticus 17:9 | holds: When it is written: “To sacrifice it” | Zevachim 108b:10 | The Gemara cites two opinions concerning the case under dispute. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna <b>concerns four or five limbs</b> that were offered up in different lapses of awareness. <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds: When it is written: “To sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 17:9), which teaches the <i>halakha</i> that <b>for</b> offering up <b>a complete</b> item one is <b>liable but</b> that one is <b>not liable for</b> offering up <b>an incomplete</b> item, <b>it is written with regard to a whole animal.</b> Accordingly, liability to bring a sin offering is incurred only once one offers up the entire animal, even if that was done limb by limb. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that that verse <b>is written with regard to each and every limb</b> of an animal. Accordingly, one is liable for each limb he offered up. <b>But</b> with regard to the offering up of <b>one limb</b> in parts, <b>everyone agrees</b> that a person is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering. According to Rabbi Shimon this would apply even if that were the only limb that was offered up; according to Rabbi Yosei this would apply only if the rest of the animal had already been offered up. |
| Leviticus 17:9 | “that [ hahu ] | Zevachim 108b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning this case is derived from a different verse. The term <b>“that [<i>hahu</i>]</b> man” (Leviticus 17:9), which is in the singular, indicates that only <b>one</b> who acts alone is liable, <b>but not two</b> who act together. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If so, what</b> <i>halakha</i> is alluded to when <b>the verse states “<i>ish ish</i>”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: Rabbi Yosei holds that the reason the Torah uses the doubled term “<i>ish ish</i>” is that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> and no <i>halakhot</i> are to be derived from it. |
| Leviticus 17:9 | The verse states: “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 109a:4 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> that one is liable for offering up outside the courtyard <b>the handful</b> taken from a meal offering; <b>the frankincense</b> that was to be offered with it; <b>the incense,</b> which was offered each day in the Sanctuary; <b>the meal offering of priests; the meal offering of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, which he offered daily; <b>and</b> to include as liable <b>one who pours as a libation three <i>log</i> of wine,</b> which is the volume of the smallest wine libation used in the Temple; <b>or</b> one who pours as a libation <b>three <i>log</i> of water</b> that was consecrated to be used as a libation during the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>? <b>The verse states: “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:9), which indicates that with regard to <b>any</b> offering that is fit to be <b>brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b> to be offered there upon the altar, one is <b>liable for</b> offering it up <b>outside</b> the courtyard. |
| Leviticus 17:9 | to sacrifice | Zevachim 109b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the rite that Rava is referring to in his response to Abaye? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who offers up</b> outside the courtyard <b>less than an olive-bulk of</b> the <b>handful</b> taken from a meal offering <b>or less than an olive-bulk of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions, or who pours as a libation</b> outside the courtyard <b>less than three <i>log</i> of wine</b> or who pours as a libation on <i>Sukkot</i> <b>less than three <i>log</i> of water,</b> that <b>he would be liable.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, <b>to sacrifice</b> it” (Leviticus 17:9). The term “to sacrifice it” indicates that one is <b>liable for the</b> sacrifice of <b>a complete</b> offering outside the courtyard <b>but one is not liable for the</b> sacrifice of <b>an incomplete</b> offering outside. |
| Leviticus 17:10 | before Rav Pappa: | Chullin 74b:9 | <b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Salla the Pious, interpreted</b> this matter <b>before Rav Pappa:</b> One of the verses prohibiting the consumption of blood states: “And whoever…eats any blood, and I will set My face against that soul that eats the blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10). <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that since it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>Blood, but</b> instead it states: <b>“Any blood,”</b> it is interpreted as teaching that <b>wherever one is liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the initial spurt from the slaughter, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a regular animal, one <b>is</b> also <b>liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of exudate,</b> i.e., the rest of the blood. <b>But wherever</b> one <b>is not liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of the soul,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of a fetus according to Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that the fetus is not considered an independent life, one <b>is</b> also <b>not liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of exudate;</b> rather, its blood is subject to a regular prohibition. |
| Leviticus 17:10 | as well, as it is taught | Keritot 22a:18 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We learn</b> this in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “And any man from the house of Israel, or from the stranger who resides among them, who consumes any blood, I will set My face against that soul that consumes blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10). The verse could simply have stated <b>“blood”; what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “any blood”?</b> |
| Leviticus 17:10 | any manner of blood” | Keritot 4b:24 | The Gemara continues: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> for consuming blood of exudate, <b>for what</b> purpose does <b>that</b> third mention of <i>karet</i> concerning blood come? The Gemara adds: <b>And even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he derives</b> the <b><i>karet</i></b> that one receives for this blood <b>from</b> a different source, from the superfluous phrase: “Who eats <b>any manner of blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:10). |
| Leviticus 17:10 | As it is taught | Keritot 4b:25 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eats any manner of blood, I will set My face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10), that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse could have stated in the first part of the verse: That eats <b>blood. What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> there: “That eats <b>any manner of blood”?</b> |
| Leviticus 17:11 | to you | Chullin 117a:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>This is not so with regard to blood,</b> as one who derives benefit from blood is not liable for misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Ulla said: The verse states</b> with regard to blood: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it <b>to you</b> upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). The term “to you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours,</b> rather than consecrated property, and is therefore not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a different derivation. By using the term <b>“to make atonement,”</b> the verse teaches that God is saying: <b>I gave it to</b> achieve <b>atonement, but</b> not to be subject <b>to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | it is | Chullin 117a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the latter part of <b>the verse,</b> which <b>states:</b> “For <b>it is</b> the blood that makes atonement for the soul” (Leviticus 17:11). The term “it is” teaches that the status of the blood remains as it is, i.e., <b>it is before atonement as</b> it is <b>after atonement.</b> As the Gemara will state, there is a principle that once the mitzva involving a consecrated item has been performed, the item is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. Accordingly, the term “it is” teaches that <b>just as after atonement,</b> i.e., after the blood has been sprinkled upon the altar, it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as the mitzva has already been performed, <b>so too, before atonement,</b> i.e., before the blood has been sprinkled upon the altar, it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul” | Keritot 22a:17 | § The mishna teaches that one is not liable for consuming blood of exudate, i.e., that oozes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of blood concludes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> one <b>liable in</b> the case of <b>blood of exudate.</b> The Gemara adds that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Yehuda concedes with regard to atonement</b> that if one sacrifices an offering and the priest sprinkles the blood of exudate on the corners of the altar, the blood does not atone. This is <b>as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul”</b> (Leviticus 17:11), which teaches that <b>blood with which the soul departs,</b> i.e., the blood that spurts immediately upon slaughter, <b>atones, but</b> blood <b>with which the soul does not depart,</b> i.e., the blood that drains out after the initial spurt, <b>does not atone.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:11 | leaves | Keritot 4b:26 | <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the punishment of <i>karet</i> concerning the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals with regard to which <b>the soul</b> of the animal <b>leaves</b> the body when it emerges, as atonement is achieved through this blood, and the next verse states: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). Rabbi Yehuda continues: <b>From where</b> do I derive that the same punishment of <i>karet</i> applies to the <b>blood of a non-sacred</b> animal <b>and the blood of exudate? The verse states: “Any manner of blood.”</b> Rava’s statement, that the punishment of <i>karet</i> for consuming blood of exudate is derived from a different verse, does not accord with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda either. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | and I have given it to you | Meilah 11a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who says</b> that <b>one is not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> the blood, despite the fact that it comes from a consecrated offering? <b>Ulla said</b> that blood is not consecrated, because <b>the verse states:</b> “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, <b>and I have given it to you</b> upon the altar to atone for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). “To you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours,</b> and it is not the property of the Temple. A Sage <b>of the school</b> of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> likewise <b>taught</b> that the term <b>“to atone”</b> teaches that God says: <b>I gave it for atonement, and not for</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | life” | Meilah 11a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different phrase, as <b>the verse states:</b> “For <b>it is the blood that atones by</b> reason of the <b>life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). The word “is” teaches that the blood remains as it <b>is,</b> retaining the same status <b>before atonement as after atonement: Just as after atonement</b> it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as the mitzva has been performed, <b>so too, before atonement it is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | for it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement” | Menachot 93b:7 | § The mishna states: The requirement of <b>placing hands is a non-essential mitzva. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall place his hand</b> upon the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted for him</b> to effect atonement for him” (Leviticus 1:4). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But does</b> the rite of <b>placing hands effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of the <b>blood? As it is stated</b> with regard to blood: “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to effect atonement for your souls, <b>for it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated placing hands</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>atones</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | the blood? As it is stated: “For it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement” | Menachot 93b:8 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to waving in this way:</b> “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering <b>to be waved to effect atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 14:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Does waving</b> the offering <b>effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of <b>the blood? As it is stated: “For it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated waving</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>effects atonement</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of life” | Pesachim 65a:12 | The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that even <b>Rabbi Yehuda concedes with regard to atonement</b> that sprinkling on the altar blood squeezed from the animal after the initial spurt concluded <b>does not make atonement? As it is stated:</b> “For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; <b>for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). |
| Leviticus 17:11 | to you | Yoma 59b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that there is no misuse for blood, derived? <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it <b>to you</b> upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). “To you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours.</b> It is not the property of the Temple; rather, it belongs to all of the Jewish people. <b>The school</b> of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> likewise <b>taught</b> that the phrase <b>“to make atonement”</b> teaches that God says: <b>I gave it for atonement and not for</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated objects. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | it is | Yoma 59b:3 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different phrase. <b>The verse states:</b> “For <b>it is</b> the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” (Leviticus 17:11), which indicates that it retains the same status <b>before atonement as after atonement: Just as after atonement</b> it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated objects, as the mitzva has been performed, <b>so too, before atonement it is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated objects. As the Gemara states below, there is a general principle that once the mitzva involving a certain object has been performed, the object is no longer subject to misuse of consecrated objects. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” | Yoma 5a:2 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings that apply <b>throughout the generations</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we derive</b> that failure to place hands on the head of the animal <b>does not invalidate</b> the offering? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, <b>and it shall be accepted</b> for him to atone on his behalf” (Leviticus 1:4). <b>Does</b> the <b>placing</b> of <b>hands atone</b> for one’s sins? <b>Isn’t atonement</b> accomplished <b>only by</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11)? |
| Leviticus 17:11 | the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” | Yoma 5a:5 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings <b>throughout the generations,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that failure to wave the offering <b>does not invalidate</b> the offering? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse says: “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt-offering <b>to be waved to make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 14:21). <b>Does waving</b> the offering <b>atone</b> for one’s sins? <b>Isn’t atonement</b> accomplished <b>only by</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11)? <b>And</b> for <b>what</b> purpose, then, <b>does the verse state: To be waved to make atonement?</b> It teaches that if <b>one deemed</b> the ritual of <b>waving</b> to be <b>a peripheral aspect of the mitzva</b> and therefore failed to perform it, <b>the verse ascribes to him</b> status <b>as though he did not achieve</b> optimal <b>atonement; and</b> nevertheless, the offering <b>atones</b> for his sins on his behalf. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | with regard to blood, | Yoma 60a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if this <i>halakha</i> is derived from those two cases, <b>why do I</b> need <b>these three verses</b> stated <b>with regard to blood,</b> from which it is derived that the prohibition against misuse of consecrated objects does not apply to the remainder of blood that flows to the Kidron River? The reference is to the three phrases singled out above from the verse: “I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” (Leviticus 17:11). |
| Leviticus 17:11 | “And I have given it to you upon the altar to atone | Zevachim 26b:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> When the mishna states that the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> it means that the <b>meat</b> is unfit for consumption. <b>But</b> the <b>owner</b> of the offering has <b>achieved atonement</b> through it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the blood: <b>“And I have given it to you upon the altar to atone</b> for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11), from which it is derived that <b>once the blood reaches</b> any location on <b>the altar,</b> the <b>owner</b> of the offering has <b>achieved atonement.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:11 | of the soul” | Zevachim 35a:4 | The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda concedes with regard to atonement that</b> presenting blood of exudate <b>does not effect atonement, as it is stated:</b> “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; <b>for it is the blood</b> that makes atonement by reason <b>of the soul”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). |
| Leviticus 17:11 | with regard to blood, | Zevachim 46a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>these three verses</b> stated <b>with regard to blood,</b> from which it is derived that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property does not apply to blood? The reference is to the three terms specified earlier, in the expositions of Ulla, the school of Rabbi Yishmael, and Rabbi Yoḥanan, from the verse: “I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul” (Leviticus 17:11). |
| Leviticus 17:11 | and I have given it to you | Zevachim 46a:2 | § The mishna teaches: Even with regard to the items for which one is not liable for eating them due to violation of the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>, one is, nevertheless, liable for eating them due to violation of the prohibition of <i>notar</i>, and due to violation of the prohibition against eating consecrated food while ritually impure, <b>except for the blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? Before answering this question, the Gemara cites another discussion as to why the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of consecrated property does not apply to blood. <b>Ulla says: The verse states</b> with regard to blood: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, <b>and I have given it to you</b> upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). “To you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours;</b> it is not the property of the Temple, so it is not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 17:11 | it is | Zevachim 46a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the latter part of <b>the verse,</b> which <b>states:</b> “For <b>it is</b> the blood that makes atonement for the soul” (Leviticus 17:11). The term “it is” teaches that the status of the blood remains as it is, i.e., <b>it is before atonement as</b> it is <b>after atonement.</b> As the Gemara will state, there is a principle that once the mitzva involving a consecrated item has been performed, the item is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property.

| Leviticus 17:11 | the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” | Zevachim 6a:15 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand on the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted</b> for him to atone for him” (Leviticus 1:4). <b>And does placing hands atone</b> for one’s sins? <b>But isn’t atonement</b> achieved <b>only by</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood, as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life”</b> (Leviticus 17:11)? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And he shall place…and it shall be accepted</b> for him <b>to atone”?</b> This teaches <b>that if one deemed</b> the ritual of <b>placing hands</b> to be <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and consequently failed to perform it, <b>the verse ascribes to him</b> blame <b>as though</b> the offering <b>did not atone</b> for his sins; <b>and</b> nevertheless, the offering <b>atoned</b> for his sins. |
| Leviticus 17:12 | as it is stated: “Therefore I said to the children of Israel” | Chullin 87a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it with earth” (Leviticus 17:13), indicating that <b>the one who poured out</b> its blood, i.e., slaughtered the animal, <b>shall cover it.</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or bird <b>and did not cover</b> the blood, <b>and another person saw</b> the uncovered blood, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the person who saw the blood <b>is obligated to cover</b> it? It is derived from the following verse, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore I said to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 17:12), which is <b>a warning to all the children of Israel</b> to fulfill the mitzva of covering the blood. |
| Leviticus 17:12 | No soul of you shall eat blood, | Pesachim 22a:7 | The Gemara further challenges Rabbi Abbahu’s opinion: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition of eating <b>blood, as the Merciful One says:</b> “Therefore I said to the children of Israel: <b>No soul of you shall eat blood,</b> neither shall any convert that dwells among you eat blood” (Leviticus 17:12). According to Rabbi Abbahu’s opinion, one may derive from this verse that in addition to the prohibition against eating blood, it is prohibited to benefit from it as well. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna: Both <b>these and these,</b> the remnants of the blood from sin-offerings brought on the altar and other blood sprinkled on it, descend and <b>mix in the canal</b> from which water leaves the Temple. They then <b>exit to the Kidron Valley and are sold</b> at a special price <b>to gardeners as a fertilizer. And</b> one who does not first purchase the blood from the Temple <b>misuses consecrated property.</b> Apparently, under certain circumstances, one may benefit from blood which it is prohibited to consume. |
| Leviticus 17:12 | “No soul of you shall eat blood” | Yevamot 114a:14 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear,</b> as the verse states: <b>“No soul of you shall eat blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:12). This serves <b>to warn adults concerning minors. What, is it not</b> the case <b>that</b> this means adults must <b>say to</b> children: <b>Do not eat blood?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> here, too, it means <b>that</b> an adult may not feed minors <b>by</b> direct <b>action.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | and he shall cover | Bava Kamma91b:16 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird: <b>“He shall pour</b> out the blood thereof, <b>and he shall cover</b> it with dust” (Leviticus 17:13). This teaches that <b>the one who poured</b> the blood, i.e., the one who slaughtered, <b>shall cover</b> the blood. <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who slaughtered</b> an undomesticated animal or bird, <b>and another preempted</b> him <b>and covered</b> the blood, <b>and Rabban Gamliel deemed him liable to give ten golden coins to</b> the one who slaughtered the animal, as he prevented him from performing the mitzva. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | as it is stated: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it in earth” | Beitzah 7b:21 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Let us say</b> that <b>the Master,</b> i.e., Rav Yosef, <b>and Rabba dispute</b> the following statement <b>that Rabbi Zeira</b> said that <b>Rav said, as Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or bird is obligated to perform the mitzva of covering the blood, and therefore <b>he must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it,<b> as it is stated: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it in earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). It <b>is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth, but “in earth,”</b> indicating that the blood must be concealed inside the earth. The verse thereby <b>teaches that one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>must place earth beneath and earth above</b> the blood. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | he shall spill its blood, | Chullin 27b:14 | On the matter of slaughtering birds, <b>Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Pineḥas: Slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law, as it is stated:</b> “And whatever man there be of the children of Israel…who traps any undomesticated animal or bird that may be eaten, <b>he shall spill its blood,</b> and cover it in earth” (Leviticus 17:13). This indicates that <b>mere spilling</b> of its blood <b>is sufficient.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | and cover it in earth” | Chullin 31a:2 | The Gemara notes another difficulty encountered in the slaughter of a flying bird with an arrow. <b>But doesn’t</b> the bird’s blood <b>require covering</b> with earth? <b>And if you would say that</b> Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa <b>covers</b> the blood, <b>but doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In fulfilling the mitzva of covering the blood, <b>one who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or bird <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “He shall spill its blood, <b>and cover it in earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). <b>It is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth, but rather “in earth</b>.” This <b>teaches that one who slaughters must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> the blood, so that the blood will be within the earth. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | as it is stated: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth” | Chullin 83b:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to cover the blood of <b>sacrificial</b> birds? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because of</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> that is difficult. <b>As Rabbi Zeira says: One who slaughters</b> a bird or an undomesticated animal <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). It <b>is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth,</b> but <b>rather, “in earth,”</b> indicating that the blood must be concealed inside the earth. The verse <b>teaches that one who slaughters</b> a bird or undomesticated animal <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> the blood. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | who traps | Chullin 84a:17 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to covering the blood: “And any man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, <b>who traps</b> a trapping of an undomesticated animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth” (Leviticus 17:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is obligated to cover the blood of an undomesticated animal or bird <b>that one traps. From where</b> is it derived that undomesticated animals or birds that are <b>already</b> considered <b>trapped on their own, such as geese and chickens</b> that do not roam freely, are also included in the mitzva of covering the blood? |
| Leviticus 17:13 | and cover | Chullin 84a:5 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that birds consecrated for Temple maintenance may be redeemed even after their slaughter. <b>And</b> although it would seem that their slaughter is fit to render the meat permitted and that one should therefore be obligated in the mitzva of covering the blood, it is <b>different here, as the verse states: “And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it” (Leviticus 17:13). By juxtaposing “pour out” to “cover,” the verse indicates that the obligation to cover the blood applies only to blood <b>that is lacking only pouring and covering,</b> without any intervening step. <b>Excluded</b> is <b>this</b> blood of birds consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>which is lacking pouring, redeeming, and covering.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | “An undomesticated animal or bird” | Chullin 84a:7 | The Gemara cites another source for the exclusion of consecrated animals from the requirement of covering their blood: <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>“An undomesticated animal or bird”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The juxtaposition of these two species intimates an analogy between them: <b>Just as</b> the <b>undomesticated animal</b> referred to in the verse <b>is not consecrated,</b> as undomesticated animals are never fit for sacrifice, <b>so too,</b> the <b>bird</b> referred to in the verse <b>is not consecrated.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | slaughtered outside | Chullin 85a:18 | § The Gemara resumes its discussion of the dispute in the mishna: <b>What is the reason that Rabbi Meir</b> holds one is obligated <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>covering the blood</b> in a case of ineffective slaughter? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Meir <b>derives</b> this from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>pouring</b> and <b>pouring, from</b> the case of a sacrificial animal that was <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard. One verse states with regard to covering the blood: “And he shall pour out its blood” (Leviticus 17:13), and one verse states with regard to sacrificial animals slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard: “He has poured blood” (Leviticus 17:4). Accordingly, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard, it is a case of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted but <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter, so too here,</b> with regard to covering the blood, an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | that may be eaten” | Chullin 85a:19 | The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> would respond: It is <b>written</b> with regard to covering the blood: “An undomesticated animal or bird <b>that may be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), indicating that the verse is referring specifically to slaughter fit to render the meat permitted for consumption. <b>And Rabbi Meir</b> holds: <b>That</b> phrase <b>comes to exclude a ritually impure bird</b> from the mitzva of covering the blood. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> would respond: <b>What is the reason an impure bird</b> is not included in the mitzva of covering the blood? It is <b>because it is not fit for consumption.</b> If so, <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> not be included in the mitzva of covering the blood, since <b>it is</b> also <b>not fit for consumption.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | its blood” | Chullin 86b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> responds to this: The source <b>for separating</b> the obligations with regard to an undomesticated animal and a bird <b>is derived from</b> the verse: “And he shall pour out <b>its blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The verse makes reference to the blood of only one animal, indicating that the obligation applies after slaughtering either a bird or an undomesticated animal. <b>And the Rabbis</b> respond that <b>“its blood”</b> also <b>indicates many,</b> as the term: Blood, can refer to any amount of blood. This is demonstrated by that <b>which is written: “For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof”</b> (Leviticus 17:14). |
| Leviticus 17:13 | The Sages taught | Chullin 86b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: “An undomesticated animal or bird” (Leviticus 17:13). <b>“Undomesticated animal”</b> is inclusive, i.e., <b>any</b> number of animals is <b>included</b> in the term <b>undomesticated animal, whether many or few.</b> Likewise, <b>“bird”</b> is inclusive, i.e., <b>any</b> amount is <b>included</b> in the term <b>bird, whether many or few. From here</b> the Rabbis <b>stated:</b> If one <b>slaughtered one hundred undomesticated animals in one place, one covering</b> of the blood suffices <b>for all</b> the animals. Likewise, if one slaughtered <b>one hundred birds in one place, one covering</b> of the blood suffices <b>for all</b> the birds. If one slaughtered <b>an undomesticated animal and a bird in one place, one covering for all of</b> the blood is sufficient. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | thereafter he should slaughter the bird, as it is stated: “An undomesticated animal or bird” | Chullin 86b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one <b>slaughtered an undomesticated animal, he should cover its</b> blood immediately <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter he should slaughter the bird, as it is stated: “An undomesticated animal or bird”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The term “or” indicates that each type must be attended to separately. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | and cover | Chullin 87a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it with earth” (Leviticus 17:13), indicating that <b>the one who poured out</b> its blood, i.e., slaughtered the animal, <b>shall cover it.</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or bird <b>and did not cover</b> the blood, <b>and another person saw</b> the uncovered blood, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the person who saw the blood <b>is obligated to cover</b> it? It is derived from the following verse, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore I said to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 17:12), which is <b>a warning to all the children of Israel</b> to fulfill the mitzva of covering the blood. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | “And cover it” | Chullin 88a:10 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>“And cover it”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may cover</b> the blood <b>with stones or</b> merely <b>turn a vessel over it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “With earth.”</b> Based on this expression <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>earth</b> may be used. <b>From where</b> does one derive <b>to include fine manure, fine sand, crushed stones, crushed potsherd, fine chaff of flax,</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | “And he shall cover it” | Chullin 88a:4 | § The mishna teaches that one is obligated to cover <b>blood that spurts</b> outside the pit over which the animal was slaughtered, or onto the wall, <b>and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall cover it”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), which <b>teaches that</b> one is <b>obligated to cover blood that spurted and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When there is no blood except that</b> blood. <b>But</b> if <b>there is</b> other <b>blood that is not that</b> blood, one is <b>exempt from covering</b> it. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | “Its blood” | Chullin 88a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that the expression: <b>“Its blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), indicates an obligation to cover <b>all of its blood,</b> even the blood that spurts out. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>“its blood”</b> indicates that one may fulfill the mitzva with any part of the blood, <b>even</b> with <b>a small amount of its blood. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>“its blood”</b> refers to the <b>special</b> blood, i.e., the blood of the soul. |
| Leviticus 17:13 | and cover | Shabbat 22a:3 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is prohibited to count money opposite a Hanukkah light.</b> Rav Yehuda relates: <b>When I said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: Does the Hanukkah light have sanctity</b> that would prohibit one from using its light? <b>Rav Yosef strongly objected to this</b> question: What kind of question is that; <b>does the blood</b> of a slaughtered undomesticated animal or fowl <b>have sanctity? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages interpreted the verse: “<b>He shall spill</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it with dust” (Leviticus 17:13): <b>With that which he spilled, he shall cover.</b> Just as a person spills the blood of a slaughtered animal with his hand, so too, he is obligated to cover the blood with this hand and <b>not cover it with his foot.</b> The reason is so <b>that mitzvot will not be contemptible to him. Here too,</b> one should treat the Hanukkah lights as if they were sacred and refrain from utilizing them for other purposes, so that <b>mitzvot will not be contemptible to him.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:13 | in dust” | Sotah 16a:6 | <b>The Torah states:</b> “And whatsoever man…that takes in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it <b>in dust”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the blood may be covered <b>in anything</b> similar to dust. <b>The Torah states</b> with regard to the nazirite: “All the days of his vow of naziriteship there shall be no <b>razor</b> come upon his head” (Numbers 6:5), <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the nazirite may not remove his hair <b>with anything. The Torah states:</b> “That he writes her a <b>bill [<i>sefer</i>]</b> of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:1). The word <i>sefer</i> denotes a scroll, <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the husband may inscribe the bill of divorce <b>on anything</b> that is detached from the ground and suitable to be written upon, not only on a scroll. |
| Leviticus 17:14 | which is written: “For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof” | Chullin 86b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> responds to this: The source <b>for separating</b> the obligations with regard to an undomesticated animal and a bird <b>is derived from</b> the verse: “And he shall pour out <b>its blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The verse makes reference to the blood of only one animal, indicating that the obligation applies after slaughtering either a bird or an undomesticated animal. <b>And the Rabbis</b> respond that <b>“its blood”</b> also <b>indicates many,</b> as the term: Blood, can refer to any amount of blood. This is demonstrated by that <b>which is written: “For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof”</b> (Leviticus 17:14). |
| Leviticus 17:15 | is stated | Chullin 120a:22 | The Gemara comments: A novelty <b>of this kind is also taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Zavim</i> 5:9) <b>with regard to</b> one who eats <b>the</b> unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird: One who liquefied</b> the carcass of an unslaughtered kosher bird <b>in fire</b> and drank the substance <b>is impure.</b> But one who liquefied it <b>in the sun</b> and drank it <b>is pure. And we discussed it: Eating</b> and not drinking <b>is stated</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass, as it is written: “And every soul that eats an unslaughtered carcass or that which is mauled by an animal, whether he is native or stranger, he shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 17:15). Why, then, does one who drinks a kosher bird carcass become impure? |
| Leviticus 17:15 | a tereifa | Zevachim 69a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> a bird offering whose nape was pinched inside the Temple courtyard <b>also a carcass? Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is derived from that which <b>the verse states:</b> “Every soul that eats a carcass or <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b>…shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 17:15). A <i>tereifa</i> is an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months. It is derived from this verse that <b>just as</b> having the status of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> does not render permitted</b> any <b>forbidden</b> bird, <b>so too, any</b> type of death <b>that does not render permitted</b> any <b>forbidden</b> bird renders the animal a carcass with regard to ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 17:15 | a carcass | Zevachim 69a:9 | § The mishna rules that if a priest <b>pinched with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>or</b> if he pinched <b>at night,</b> the offering does not render one ritually impure when in his throat. With regard to this issue <b>the Sages taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that invalid <b>pinching that</b> occurs <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, such as pinching with the left hand or pinching at night, <b>would</b> cause the offering to <b>render</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states:</b> “Every soul that eats <b>a carcass</b>…shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 17:15). Bird offerings whose napes were pinched inside the Temple courtyard are not considered carcasses. |
| Leviticus 17:15 | a tereifa | Zevachim 69b:10 | § The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that a bird that is a <i>tereifa</i> imparts impurity even when slaughtered? He too <b>found a verse and interpreted</b> it. The Torah states with regard to the ritual impurity of kosher bird carcasses: “And every soul that eats <b>a carcass,</b> or <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b>…he shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 17:15). <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Why was</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> stated? If</b> the verse is referring to <b>a live <i>tereifa</i>,</b> it should not be impure, as the term <b>“a carcass” is stated,</b> indicating that to impart impurity the bird must be dead. <b>If</b> it is referring to <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> that <b>is not alive,</b> but rather has died of its wounds, <b>it</b> falls <b>within the category of a carcass. Rather,</b> the word <i>tereifa</i> is written <b>to include a <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered</b> before it had the opportunity to die by itself, to teach <b>that it imparts ritual impurity</b> as would a carcass. |
| Leviticus 17:15 | Here too, | Zevachim 69b:15 | <b>Here too,</b> the word <i>tereifa</i> in the verse concerning the impurity of kosher bird carcasses (Leviticus 17:15) should be interpreted as <b>excluding</b> a carcass of <b>a non-kosher bird</b> from ritual impurity, <b>as</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> does not apply to its species.</b> Therefore, this verse cannot serve as a source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the impurity of a slaughtered bird that is a <i>tereifa</i>. |
| Leviticus 17:15 | You shall not eat a non-kosher | Zevachim 69b:17 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the carcass of a non-kosher bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b> But <b>the verse states,</b> concerning the impurity of carcasses of birds: <b>“A carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat”</b> (Leviticus 22:8). This type of impurity applies only to <b>those</b> birds <b>that are forbidden</b> specifically <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., kosher birds that died without ritual slaughter. <b>This</b> carcass of a non-kosher animal <b>is excluded,</b> and is not impure, <b>as</b> it is <b>forbidden not due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> but <b>rather due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat a non-kosher</b> bird, to render yourself impure with it. Consequently, the word <i>tereifa</i> in the aforementioned verse (Leviticus 17:15) teaches that a slaughtered <i>tereifa</i> imparts ritual impurity, as originally posited. |
| Leviticus 17:15 | from the first verse: | Zevachim 70a:15 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him derive</b> this measure <b>from the first verse:</b> “And every soul that eats a carcass…shall be impure” (Leviticus 17:15), <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> this <i>halakha</i> using <b>the language of consumption.</b> |
| Leviticus 17:15 | this | Zevachim 70a:6 | The Gemara asks: But <b>if so,</b> i.e., if one could have learned the <i>halakha</i> of the forbidden fat of a <i>tereifa</i> from the <i>halakha</i> of the forbidden fat of a non-kosher animal, then <b>this</b> word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse concerning the impurity of a kosher bird carcass (Leviticus 17:15) <b>is also necessary</b> for its own sake, to teach that the carcass of a kosher bird that is a <i>tereifa</i> is impure. It is necessary for this to be written with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird so <b>that you should not say</b> as follows: <b>Since a non-kosher bird</b> is <b>forbidden for consumption, and a <i>tereifa</i></b> is <b>forbidden for consumption,</b> therefore <b>just as a non-kosher bird does not impart impurity, so too a <i>tereifa</i> does not impart impurity.</b> According the Rabbi Yehuda, the word is necessary to include the slaughtered kosher bird that is a <i>tereifa</i>, not a carcass. |
| Leviticus 18:3 | burning? But isn’t it written: “And you shall not walk in their statutes” | Avodah Zarah11a:9 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>We burn</b> items <b>upon the</b> death of <b>kings</b> as an expression of grief, <b>and</b> this is <b>not of the ways of the Amorites,</b> but rather a Jewish custom? <b>And if</b> this <b>is</b> an idolatrous <b>custom, how could we</b> perform this public <b>burning? But isn’t it written: “And you shall not walk in their statutes”</b> (Leviticus 18:3)? |
| Leviticus 18:3 | of the ways of the Amorites, | Bava Kamma83a:3 | The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The household of Rabban Gamliel is different, as they</b> held <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> Since knowledge of Greek wisdom was crucial for the members of this family, the Sages exempted them from the general decree, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>cuts his hair</b> in the fashion of <b><i>komi</i>,</b> a certain haircut favored by the Romans, <b>this is</b> considered one <b>of the ways of the Amorites,</b> i.e., a gentile practice prohibited by the Torah (Leviticus 18:3). Despite this, the Sages <b>permitted Avtolmos bar Reuven to cut his hair</b> in the fashion of <b><i>komi</i>, because he</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> Likewise, <b>they permitted</b> the members <b>of the household of Rabban Gamliel to discuss</b> matters <b>of Greek wisdom, because they</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:3 | and the blood flows and descends into the hole. And in the marketplace, one may not do so, as it is stated: “Neither shall you follow their statutes” | Chullin 41b:7 | <b>And one who wishes to clean his courtyard</b> and ensure that it will not be sullied with blood, <b>how does he do</b> so? <b>He fashions a place</b> with an incline or a furrow <b>outside the small hole, and slaughters</b> the animal there, <b>and the blood flows and descends into the hole. And in the marketplace, one may not do so, as it is stated: “Neither shall you follow their statutes”</b> (Leviticus 18:3). <b>And if he did so, he requires examination after his</b> actions to ascertain whether he is a heretic. |
| Leviticus 18:3 | Rabbi Yehuda said to the Rabbis: I too, know that it is a degrading death, but what shall I do, as the Torah states: “And you shall not follow their statutes” | Sanhedrin 52b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to the Rabbis: I too, know that it is a degrading death, but what shall I do, as the Torah states: “And you shall not follow their statutes”</b> (Leviticus 18:3), i.e., it is prohibited to adopt the practices of the gentiles. |
| Leviticus 18:3 | walking in the statutes of the nations, | Tamid 31b:5 | The mishna teaches that the priests <b>would not tie the lamb</b> by fastening all four of its legs together. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: This is a matter of dispute between <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda. One</b> of these Sages <b>said:</b> The animal is not tied <b>because</b> this would constitute <b>degradation of sacred items; and</b> the other <b>one said</b> that the animal is not tied <b>because that</b> method is the one adopted in pagan worship, and is therefore considered to be <b>walking in the statutes of the nations,</b> and the verse states: “You shall not walk in their statutes” (Leviticus 18:3). |
| Leviticus 18:4 | “You shall do My ordinances, | Yoma 67b:8 | The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> related to the scapegoat. <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“You shall do My ordinances,</b> and you shall keep My statutes to follow them, I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 18:4), that the phrase: My ordinances, is a reference to <b>matters that,</b> even <b>had they not been written,</b> it would have been <b>logical that they be written. They are</b> the prohibitions against <b>idol worship, prohibited sexual relations, bloodshed, theft, and blessing God,</b> a euphemism for cursing the Name of God. |
| Leviticus 18:4 | the verse states: “I am the Lord” | Yoma 67b:9 | The phrase: <b>And you shall keep my statutes,</b> is a reference to <b>matters that Satan</b> and the nations of the world <b>challenge</b> because the reason for these mitzvot are not known. <b>They are:</b> The prohibitions against <b>eating pork; wearing</b> garments that are made from <b>diverse kinds</b> of material, i.e., wool and linen; performing the <b><i>ḥalitza</i></b> ceremony with <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> a widow who must participate in a levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>; <b>the purification</b> ceremony <b>of the leper; and the scapegoat. And lest you say these</b> have no reason and <b>are meaningless acts,</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 18:4), to indicate: <b>I am the Lord, I decreed these</b> statutes <b>and you have no right to doubt them.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:5 | he shall live by them” | Avodah Zarah27b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what would</b> ben Dama <b>have said?</b> What verse did he intend to cite as proof that it was permitted for him to be healed by a heretic? The verse: “You shall therefore keep My statutes, and My ordinances, which if a man do, <b>he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). This teaches that one should live by God’s mitzvot, <b>and not that he</b> should <b>die by them.</b> This verse serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one may violate a prohibition in order to save a life. |
| Leviticus 18:5 | which if a person do, and shall live by them” | Avodah Zarah3a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are they <b>not</b> rewarded for fulfilling those mitzvot? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest? The verse states:</b> “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, <b>which if a person do, and shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). It <b>is not stated: Priests, Levites, and Israelites, but rather</b> the general term <b>“person.”</b> From here <b>you learn that even a gentile who engages in</b> the study of <b>Torah is like a High Priest.</b> This demonstrates that gentiles are rewarded for fulfilling mitzvot, despite the fact that they are not commanded to do so. |
| Leviticus 18:5 | and live by them” | Avodah Zarah54a:4 | <b>Rather, Rava says: All</b> cases of idol worship <b>were included in</b> the prohibition: “You shall not bow down to them, <b>nor shall you serve them”</b> (Exodus 20:5), including the case of worship under duress. <b>When the verse specified to you:</b> “You shall keep My statutes…which a man shall do <b>and live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), <b>and not that he should die by them,</b> the verse <b>excluded</b> the case of <b>duress.</b> One would conclude from the verse that one who acts under duress is not considered an idol worshipper, and he is not required to sacrifice his life to refrain from worshipping idols. |
| Leviticus 18:5 | “Which if a person does, he shall live by them” | Bava Kamma38a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do they <b>not</b> receive reward for fulfilling those mitzvot? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even a gentile who engages in Torah is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest? The verse states</b> with regard to the mitzvot: <b>“Which if a person does, he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). It <b>is not stated:</b> Which if <b>priests and Levites and Israelites</b> do, they shall live by them, <b>but rather: A person,</b> indicating that all people are included. <b>You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:5 | “That a person shall perform and live by them” | Makkot 23b:1 | <b>“That a person shall perform and live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). It is inferred <b>that</b> with regard to <b>one who sits and did not perform a transgression,</b> God <b>gives him a reward like</b> that received by one who <b>performs a mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:5 | which if a man does he shall live by them” | Sanhedrin 59a:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated:</b> “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, <b>which if a man does he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). The phrase: Which if <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites</b> do they shall live by them, <b>is not stated,</b> but <b>rather: “A man,”</b> which indicates mankind in general. <b>You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:5 | “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances” | Sanhedrin 60a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the term “My statutes” is understood as referring to mitzvot that were already given to the descendants of Noah, then the verse: <b>“You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), referring to the entire Torah, should also obligate the descendants of Noah, as it would be referring to: <b>Statutes that I have already instituted for you.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:5 | and he shall live by them” | Sanhedrin 74a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> should one <b>not</b> transgress the prohibition of <b>idol worship</b> to save his life? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if a person is told: Worship idols and you will not be killed, from where</b> is it derived <b>that he should worship</b> the idol <b>and not be killed? The verse states:</b> “You shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which a person shall do, <b>and he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), thereby teaching that the mitzvot were given to provide life, <b>but</b> they were <b>not</b> given so <b>that</b> one will <b>die due to their</b> observance. |
| Leviticus 18:5 | the verse states: “I am the Lord” | Yoma 67b:4 | <b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b><i>gezeira</i></b> is written <b>lest you say</b> the procedure of the scapegoat <b>is a meaningless act,</b> since what sanctity and atonement is achieved in sending the goat to Azazel and pushing it from the cliff? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), i.e., <b>I, the Lord, decreed it [<i>gezartiv</i>], and you have no right to question it.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:5 | and live by them” | Yoma 85b:3 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said:</b> It is stated: <b>“And the children of Israel shall keep Shabbat,</b> to observe Shabbat” (Exodus 31:16).<b> The Torah said: Desecrate one Shabbat on his behalf so he will observe many <i>Shabbatot</i>. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If I would</b> have been <b>there</b> among those Sages who debated this question, <b>I would have said</b> that <b>my proof is preferable to theirs,</b> as it states: “You shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, which a person shall do <b>and live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), <b>and not that he</b> should <b>die by them.</b> In all circumstances, one must take care not to die as a result of fulfilling the mitzvot. |
| Leviticus 18:6 | of Rabbi Pedat. As Rabbi Pedat says: The Torah prohibited only intimacy that involves engaging in prohibited sexual relations, as it is stated: “None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness” | Avodah Zarah17a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Ḥisda, who stated above that the Torah requires one to maintain a distance of four cubits from a prostitute, <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Pedat. As Rabbi Pedat says: The Torah prohibited only intimacy that involves engaging in prohibited sexual relations, as it is stated: “None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:6). The prohibition against intimacy in the Torah applies exclusively to sexual intercourse, and all other kinds of intimacy that do not include actual intercourse are not included in the prohibition. |
| Leviticus 18:6 | because it is written: “None of you [ ish , ish ] shall approach any near of kin | Chagigah 11b:10 | § The Gemara continues to clarify the mishna, which reads: <b>One may not expound</b> the topic of <b>forbidden sexual relations before three</b> individuals. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “None of you [<i>ish</i>, <i>ish</i>] shall approach any near of kin</b> to uncover their nakedness” (Leviticus 18:6). <i>Ish</i>, <i>ish</i>, literally means: Man, man. It is understood as an allusion to the number of students permitted to study the topic. This is as it is explained immediately: <b>“Man, man”</b> equals <b>two; “any near of kin to him”</b> is <b>one; and the Merciful One states: “You shall not approach to uncover their nakedness,”</b> which indicates that one may not expound the <i>halakhot</i> of forbidden sexual relations in the presence of three individuals. |
| Leviticus 18:6 | conjugal rights, and so it says: “None of you shall approach to any who is near [ she’er ] of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness” | Ketubot 47b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: “<i>She’era</i>”; this is</b> her <b>conjugal rights, and so it says: “None of you shall approach to any who is near [<i>she’er</i>] of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:6), which demonstrates that the word <i>she’er</i> is used in the context of sexual relations. <b>“<i>Kesuta</i>” is</b> understood <b>in its literal sense</b> as referring to clothing. <b>“<i>Onata</i>”; this is sustenance, and so it says: “And He afflicted you [<i>vayanekha</i>], and made you suffer hunger,</b> and fed you with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3). |
| Leviticus 18:6 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 57b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “No one [<i>ish ish</i>] shall approach any that is kin to him, to uncover their nakedness” (Leviticus 18:6): The verse could have stated: <b>One [<i>ish</i>]</b> shall not approach. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “no one”?</b> It is <b>to include the gentiles, who are prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>forbidden sexual relations, as Jews</b> are. |
| Leviticus 18:6 | is stated: “None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness” | Shabbat 13a:9 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this conclusion <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Pedat, as Rabbi Pedat said: The Torah only prohibited intimacy that</b> involves <b>engaging in prohibited sexual relations,</b> as it <b>is stated: “None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:6). The prohibition of intimacy in the Torah applies exclusively to relations, and all other kinds of intimacy that do not include actual relations are not included in the prohibition. When there is separation, they did not issue a decree. |
| Leviticus 18:7 | The shame of his father and the shame of his mother, | Megillah 25a:14 | We learned in the mishna: If <b>one modifies</b> the text while reading the laws of <b>forbidden sexual relations, they silence him. Rav Yosef taught</b> that this is referring to one who says: <b>The shame of his father and the shame of his mother,</b> instead of: “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:7). |
| Leviticus 18:7 | She is your mother; | Sanhedrin 53b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> for this? <b>Abaye says:</b> It is <b>because the verse states:</b> “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover: <b>She is your mother;</b> you shall not uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:7). Rabbi Yehuda derives from this verse that <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother, but you shall not render him liable</b> to bring another sin-offering <b>due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>father’s wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:7 | his mother who is not his father’s wife? Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, says: The verse states: “She is your mother” | Sanhedrin 54a:26 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, from where do they</b> derive <b>the punishment for</b> one who engages in intercourse with <b>his mother who is not his father’s wife? Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, says: The verse states: “She is your mother”</b> (Leviticus 18:7). <b>The verse renders</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>his mother who is not his father’s wife like</b> that of <b>his mother who is his father’s wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:7 | you shall not uncover” | Sanhedrin 54a:4 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>We have learned</b> the <b>punishment</b> for one who engages in intercourse with his father’s wife. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against doing this act derived? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “The nakedness of your father</b> and the nakedness of your mother <b>you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:7); the phrase <b>“the nakedness of your father” is</b> referring to <b>your father’s wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:7 | his mother who is not his father’s wife? The verse states: “The nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover” | Sanhedrin 54a:6 | <b>And</b> the verse <b>indicates</b> that one’s father’s wife is forbidden to him <b>whether</b> she is <b>his father’s wife who is his mother</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>his father’s wife who is not his mother. From where</b> is it derived that she is forbidden to him in a case where she is <b>his mother who is not his father’s wife? The verse states: “The nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:7). |
| Leviticus 18:7 | “The nakedness of your father…you shall not uncover” | Sanhedrin 54a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> answers, expounding on the verbal analogy it mentioned earlier: <b>It is stated here,</b> in the verse that describes the prohibition: <b>“The nakedness of your father…you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:7), <b>and it is stated there,</b> in the verse that describes the punishment: <b>“He has uncovered his father’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:11). It is derived from this verbal analogy that <b>just as with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition, the verse renders his mother who is not his father’s wife like his mother who is his father’s wife,</b> i.e., both are forbidden, <b>so too, with regard to</b> the <b>punishment, the verse renders his mother who is not his father’s wife like his mother who is his father’s wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:7 | “She is your mother” | Sanhedrin 54a:9 | It is derived from the phrase: <b>“She is your mother”</b> (Leviticus 18:7), that <b>you render him liable due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>his mother, but you do not render him liable due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with his <b>father’s wife.</b> The <i>baraita</i> ends here. Since the <i>halakhot</i> in the collection of <i>baraitot</i> where this <i>baraita</i> appears, <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, are in accordance with the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda, the <i>baraita</i> supports the opinion of Rava, who explains the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in this manner. |
| Leviticus 18:7 | she is your mother, | Sanhedrin 75b:10 | <b>Abaye says</b> that it is not possible that one is liable to be burned for engaging in intercourse with the mother of his mother, as <b>the verse states:</b> “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not expose; <b>she is your mother,</b> you shall not expose her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:7). Infer from this: <b>Due to</b> his intercourse with <b>his mother you deem him liable</b> to be executed, <b>but you do not deem him liable</b> to be executed <b>due to</b> his intercourse with <b>the mother of his mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:8 | “The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness” | Sanhedrin 53b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> it should be derived from the verse: <b>“The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:8), that <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>father’s wife, but you shall not render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:8 | “The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; | Sanhedrin 54a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>from where do they</b> derive <b>the prohibition of</b> intercourse with one’s <b>father’s wife?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> the verse: <b>“The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover;</b> it is your father’s nakedness” (Leviticus 18:8). |
| Leviticus 18:8 | to his father’s wife, who is referred to as his father’s nakedness | Sanhedrin 58b:2 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> holds that <b>it is preferable to interpret</b> the term “his father” as referring <b>to his father’s wife, who is referred to as his father’s nakedness</b> in the verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness” (Leviticus 18:8), <b>to the exclusion of his father’s sister, who is referred to as his father’s kin</b> in the verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s kin” (Leviticus 18:12), and who <b>is not referred to as his father’s nakedness.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:9 | “The nakedness of your sister…you shall not uncover” | Ketubot 32b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as Ulla,</b> that where there is liability to both pay money and receive lashes, one pays money but is not flogged? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if that were the case, <b>you have rendered moot</b> the prohibition <b>“The nakedness of your sister…you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:9) in that contrary to the standard prohibitions, no lashes would be administered for its violation. |
| Leviticus 18:9 | the verse states: “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother… | Makkot 5b:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We heard</b> from that verse (Leviticus 20:17) the <b>punishment</b> for engaging in intercourse with one’s sister with whom he has both parents in common. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against engaging in those acts of intercourse derived? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother…</b>you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:9). <b>I have</b> derived the prohibition against engaging in intercourse <b>only</b> with <b>the daughter of his father who is not the daughter of his mother, or</b> with <b>the daughter of his mother who is not the daughter of his father. From where</b> do I derive a prohibition against engaging in intercourse with his sister who is both <b>the daughter of his father and the daughter of his mother?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife, born of your father; she is your sister”</b> (Leviticus 18:11), indicating that engaging in intercourse with any sister is prohibited. |
| Leviticus 18:9 | “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother | Yevamot 22b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of</b> the <b>Rabbis,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>They said: Since it is written</b> in the Torah: <b>“The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother</b>…you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:9), then <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of your father, she is your sister</b>…you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:11)? <b>Conclude from this</b> that the additional verse serves <b>to make him liable</b> separately <b>due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his sister and due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his father’s wife’s daughter.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:9 | “The daughter of your father’s wife” | Yevamot 22b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, do with this</b> verse, which states: <b>“The daughter of your father’s wife”</b> (Leviticus 18:9)? <b>He requires it</b> to teach that one is liable only for relations with a half-sister whose mother is <b>someone with whom there is</b> a possibility of forging <b>marital</b> ties <b>with your father,</b> even if she was not in actuality his wife. This comes <b>to exclude his sister from</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant or a gentile woman, with whom your father cannot have marital</b> ties, since betrothal does not take effect with these women. |
| Leviticus 18:9 | the verse states: “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or born outside” | Yevamot 23a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Say</b> that this verse comes to <b>exclude</b> a union between one’s father and a woman that is forbidden to him as they are <b>liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and that since betrothal does not come into effect with her there is no marriage bond. Perhaps a sister born of such a woman would not be prohibited as the daughter of one’s father’s wife. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or born outside”</b> (Leviticus 18:9). This includes all daughters, <b>whether</b> from a woman <b>for whom</b> the Sages <b>tell your father: Maintain</b> her within your home, or <b>whether</b> the Sages <b>tell your father</b> she is a woman who is forbidden to him and therefore: <b>Send her out</b> of your home. <b>And the Merciful One states</b> that nevertheless: <b>“She is your sister.”</b> Even the daughter of a woman who was forbidden to your father such that both parties are liable to receive <i>karet</i> is called your sister. |
| Leviticus 18:10 | henna | Sanhedrin 51a:11 | The Gemara answers that the prohibition of and punishment for intercourse between a father and daughter are not stated explicitly in the Torah; rather, they are derived by means of two verbal analogies. <b>As Rava said: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). This verbal analogy indicates that just as it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with one’s granddaughter and with one’s wife’s daughter or granddaughter, so too, it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with one’s daughter. |
| Leviticus 18:10 | lewdness is not written, | Sanhedrin 75b:1 | <b>Abaye says: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying. From where</b> is it derived <b>to render a relative who comes from his</b> family, e.g., the daughter of his daughter and the daughter of his son, <b>like a relative who comes from her</b> family, e.g., the daughter of his wife and the daughter of his wife’s daughter? <b>Lewdness is stated here and lewdness is stated there.</b> Just as there, the Torah renders the status of male relatives like that of female relatives, so too here, the Torah renders the status of males like that of females. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>with regard to a relative from his</b> family the term <b>lewdness is not written,</b> as the verse states: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not expose; for theirs is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10)? |
| Leviticus 18:10 | “ henna ” | Sanhedrin 75b:2 | <b>Rava says: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> The equation of his relative to her relative is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to his relative: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not expose; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to her relative: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). Additionally, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 18:10 | the matter, | Sanhedrin 76a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But does</b> the court <b>administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> without an explicit source? The Gemara replies: This <b>is a mere disclosure</b> of <b>the matter,</b> not a derivation by means of an inference. Presumably, the punishment administered to one who engages in intercourse with the daughter of his daughter stems from the kinship with his daughter. When the verse states with regard to the daughter of his daughter: “For theirs is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), his daughter is included. |
| Leviticus 18:10 | “ henna ,” | Sanhedrin 76a:16 | <b>Rava says: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter who is not the daughter of his wife <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>henna</i>,”</b> written with regard to his descendants: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to the descendants of his wife: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). Then, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 18:10 | henna , | Sanhedrin 87b:2 | <b>As Rava says: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>henna</i>,</b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). This verbal analogy indicates that just as intercourse with one’s granddaughter and with one’s wife’s daughter or granddaughter is forbidden, so too, intercourse with one’s daughter is prohibited. |
| Leviticus 18:10 | it is written: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, you shall not uncover” | Yevamot 22b:20 | <b>As Rava raised a contradiction:</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:10), which implies, <b>consequently,</b> that her <b>son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter is permitted. And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), which states explicitly that her son’s daughter and daughter’s daughter are prohibited. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? |
| Leviticus 18:10 | hena , | Yevamot 3a:2 | <b>As Rava said: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>hena</i>,</b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>hena</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10) and the word <b><i>hena</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they [<i>hena</i>] are near kinswomen; it is wickedness” (Leviticus 18:17), indicating that every daughter is prohibited, even one from rape, just like one’s daughter through his wife. |
| Leviticus 18:10 | you may not uncover” | Yevamot 97a:15 | <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that if a man <b>raped a woman it is permitted</b> for him <b>to marry her daughter</b> is derived <b>from here. It is stated: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter,</b> even their nakedness…<b>you may not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:10). It may be inferred from here that <b>the daughter of</b> the woman’s <b>own son</b> from a different relationship, <b>and the daughter of her own daughter,</b> may be <b>uncovered,</b> i.e., intercourse with them is not prohibited. |
| Leviticus 18:11 | the verse states: “The nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife, born of your father; she is your sister” | Makkot 5b:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We heard</b> from that verse (Leviticus 20:17) the <b>punishment</b> for engaging in intercourse with one’s sister with whom he has both parents in common. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against engaging in those acts of intercourse derived? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother…</b>you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:9). <b>I have</b> derived the prohibition against engaging in intercourse <b>only</b> with <b>the daughter of his father who is not the daughter of his mother, or</b> with <b>the daughter of his mother who is not the daughter of his father.

| Leviticus 18:11 | “The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of your father, she is your sister | Yevamot 22b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of</b> the <b>Rabbis,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>They said: Since it is written</b> in the Torah: <b>“The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother</b>…you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:9), then <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of your father, she is your sister</b>…you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:11)? <b>Conclude from this</b> that the additional verse serves <b>to make him liable</b> separately <b>due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his sister and due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his father’s wife’s daughter.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:12 | “She is your father’s kinswoman [ she’er ]” | Bava Batra109b:4 | § The Gemara returns to discuss the interpretation of the term: “His kinsman” (Numbers 27:11). <b>And from where</b> does one know to derive <b>that</b> with regard to the term: <b>“His kinsman [<i>she’ero</i>],” this</b> is referring to <b>the father, as it is written</b> in the context of forbidden sexual relations: <b>“She is your father’s kinswoman [<i>she’er</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:12)? Perhaps one should <b>say</b> instead: <b>“His kinswoman,” this</b> is referring to <b>the mother, as it is</b> also <b>written: “For she is your mother’s kinswoman [<i>she’er</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:13). |
| Leviticus 18:12 | to the exclusion of his father’s sister, who is referred to as his father’s kin | Sanhedrin 58b:2 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> holds that <b>it is preferable to interpret</b> the term “his father” as referring <b>to his father’s wife, who is referred to as his father’s nakedness</b> in the verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness” (Leviticus 18:8), <b>to the exclusion of his father’s sister, who is referred to as his father’s kin</b> in the verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s kin” (Leviticus 18:12), and who <b>is not referred to as his father’s nakedness.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:12 | “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister” | Yevamot 54b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>exposition</b> that the rest of the verse introduces? <b>As it is taught in a</b> <i>baraita</i>, the verse <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister”</b> (Leviticus 18:12) indicates that the prohibition applies <b>whether</b> she is your father’s sister <b>from</b> his <b>father, or from</b> his <b>mother. Do you say</b> that she is forbidden <b>whether</b> she is your father’s sister <b>from</b> his <b>father or from</b> his <b>mother, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> a sister <b>from</b> his <b>father</b> who is forbidden, <b>but not from</b> his <b>mother?</b> |
| Leviticus 18:13 | written: “For she is your mother’s kinswoman [ she’er ]” | Bava Batra109b:4 | § The Gemara returns to discuss the interpretation of the term: “His kinsman” (Numbers 27:11). <b>And from where</b> does one know to derive <b>that</b> with regard to the term: <b>“His kinsman [<i>she’ero</i>],” this</b> is referring to <b>the father, as it is written</b> in the context of forbidden sexual relations: <b>“She is your father’s kinswoman [<i>she’er</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:12)? Perhaps one should <b>say</b> instead: <b>“His kinswoman,” this</b> is referring to <b>the mother, as it is</b> also <b>written: “For she is your mother’s kinswoman [<i>she’er</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:13). |
| Leviticus 18:14 | like her husband? As it is written: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother; you shall not approach his wife: She is your aunt” | Sanhedrin 28b:3 | <b>In Pumbedita they say</b> a different version of Rav’s answer: <b>A wife is</b> considered <b>like her husband.</b> Therefore, the wife of his stepson is considered like his stepson, and he cannot testify about her. <b>As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a wife is</b> considered <b>like her husband? As it is written: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother; you shall not approach his wife: She is your aunt”</b> (Leviticus 18:14). <b>Isn’t she the wife of his uncle,</b> and not his aunt, i.e., his father’s sister? It can therefore be concluded, <b>by inference,</b> that <b>a wife is</b> considered <b>like her husband.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:14 | two | Sanhedrin 54a:14 | <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who engages in intercourse with his father</b> is <b>liable</b> for committing <b>two</b> transgressions. <b>One who engages in intercourse with his father’s brother</b> is <b>liable</b> for committing <b>two</b> transgressions, as it is stated: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother” (Leviticus 18:14). |
| Leviticus 18:15 | “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness” | Sanhedrin 53b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then from the verse: <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:15), should it <b>also</b> be derived that <b>you shall render him liable for one forbidden sexual relationship, but you shall not render him liable for two</b> types of <b>forbidden sexual relationships?</b> |
| Leviticus 18:15 | his son’s wife, | Sanhedrin 54a:27 | The mishna teaches with regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse with his daughter-in-law</b> that he is liable both due to the fact that she is his daughter-in-law and due to the fact that she is a married woman. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him also be liable due to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>his son’s wife,</b> as it is stated in the verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:15). <b>Abaye says: The verse begins with his daughter-in-law and ends with his son’s wife, to tell you</b> that these are not two prohibitions; rather, <b>his daughter-in-law [<i>kallato</i>] is his son’s wife.</b> They are one and the same. |
| Leviticus 18:15 | she is your son’s wife, | Sanhedrin 76a:5 | <b>Abaye says:</b> That is not so, as <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall not expose the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; <b>she is your son’s wife,</b> you shall not expose her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:15). <b>Due to</b> his intercourse with <b>the wife of his son you deem him liable</b> to be executed, <b>but you do not deem him liable</b> to be executed <b>due to</b> his intercourse with <b>the wife of the son of</b> his wife. |
| Leviticus 18:15 | by Torah law? As it is written: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law” | Yevamot 21b:1 | The Gemara asks: Is this relationship not forbidden <b>by Torah law? As it is written: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law”</b> (Leviticus 18:15). The Gemara emends: <b>Say</b> instead <b>his son’s daughter-in-law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the prohibition against having a relationship with <b>his son’s daughter-in-law indeed have a conclusion? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>His daughter-in-law is a forbidden relation</b> by Torah law, <b>his son’s daughter-in-law is a secondary</b> forbidden <b>relation, and similarly, you say</b> the daughter-in-law of <b>his son and</b> the daughter-in-law of <b>his son’s son until the end of all generations</b> are secondary forbidden relationships. <b>Rather, say</b> instead that Rav was referring to <b>his daughter’s daughter-in-law.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:16 | brother, | Yevamot 21b:8 | Also, <b>the wife of his father’s paternal</b> half <b>brother,</b> his uncle, who is mentioned explicitly in the Torah (Leviticus 18:16), <b>is a forbidden relation</b> by Torah law, and the Sages decreed that <b>the wife of his father’s maternal</b> half <b>brother is a secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationship. And they decreed</b> that <b>the wife of his mother’s paternal</b> half <b>brother</b> is also a secondary forbidden relationship <b>due to the wife of his father’s maternal</b> half <b>brother. And what is the reason?</b> It is <b>because they are all called the house of the uncle;</b> it seems that in the realm of forbidden relations the Sages did issue decrees to prevent violation of a decree, and Rav Safra’s claim is incorrect. |
| Leviticus 18:16 | “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife” | Yevamot 55a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a brother’s wife itself, from where do we</b> derive that the prohibition applies to the wife of both a paternal and a maternal brother? <b>As it is taught in a</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife”</b> (Leviticus 18:16), which indicates: <b>Whether from the father or from the mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:16 | “It is your brother’s nakedness” | Yevamot 55a:8 | Since it is impossible to prove which <i>halakha</i> should serve as the model for the case of a brother’s wife, <b>the verse states</b> a second time in the same verse: <b>“It is your brother’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:16), in order to emphasize that she is forbidden <b>whether</b> she is the wife of his brother <b>from</b> his <b>father or from</b> his <b>mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:17 | as it is written in it: “ Zimma ” | Avodah Zarah17b:3 | <b>The Sages said to Rava: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>mezimma</i>? If we say</b> that it is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that will guard you, <b>as it is written in it: “<i>Zimma</i>”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), <b>and we translate</b> this term as: <b>The counsel of [<i>atzat</i>] the sinners,</b> demonstrating that <i>zimma</i> is referring to counsel or wisdom, <b>and</b> the term <i>etza</i> <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> with regard to the Torah: “This also comes forth from the Lord of hosts: <b>Wonderful is His counsel [<i>etza</i>], and great is His wisdom”</b> (Isaiah 28:29), this is difficult. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b><i>Zimma</i>,</b> and not <i>mezimma</i>. Rather, <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: From lewd matters [<i>midevar zimma</i>], it shall watch over you, the Torah shall guard you,</b> i.e., the term discernment is a reference to the Torah. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | they, | Chagigah 11b:2 | <b>As Rava said: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>they [<i>hena</i>],</b> an unusual form of this word, written in one context, and the same term, <b>they,</b> written elsewhere. As it is written: “The nakedness of a woman and her daughter…you shall not take…they [<i>hena</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). And it is written: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for they [<i>hena</i>] are your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10). This indicates that every daughter, even from the rape of a woman who is not one’s wife, is forbidden, just like one’s daughter from his wife. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | zima | Chagigah 11b:3 | Furthermore, the punishment for this transgression is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between: “It is <b>lewdness</b> [<b><i>zima</i></b>]” (Leviticus 18:17), which is written with regard to a woman and her daughter, and the same term <b>“lewdness”</b> that appears elsewhere, as it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness [<i>zima</i>]: They shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 18:17 | one category | Keritot 14b:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> It is possible for <b>one who engages in intercourse with his mother-in-law</b> to be <b>liable due to</b> the unwitting violation of the prohibitions of engaging in intercourse with <b>his mother-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother of his father-in-law.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: Those three</b> prohibitions <b>are</b> all <b>one category</b> of prohibition, derived from the same verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter” (Leviticus 18:17). Consequently, one is not liable to bring separate sin offerings for violating these prohibitions. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “They are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” | Keritot 15a:5 | <b>But here,</b> with regard to a mother-in-law, <b>where</b> there are <b>not</b> several <b>differentiated bodies,</b> as the man engaged in intercourse with only one woman, one might <b>say</b> that Sumakhos <b>holds in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The verse that introduces the prohibitions against engaging in intercourse with one’s mother-in-law, one’s mother-in-law’s mother, and one’s father-in-law’s mother concludes with the phrase: <b>“They are near kinswomen; it is lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17). This teaches that although these are different relationships, <b>the verse rendered them all one</b> single prohibition of <b>lewdness,</b> for which only a single sin offering is brought. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | with regard to the prohibition | Keritot 5a:15 | Abaye elaborates: This is <b>as Rava says: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the unusual form <b>“they [<i>henna</i>]”</b> and <b>“they [<i>henna</i>],”</b> written <b>with regard to the prohibition</b> against engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter born from the woman he raped. As it is written: “The nakedness of a woman and her daughter…you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen” (Leviticus 18:17). And it is stated: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter; for they [<i>henna</i>] are your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10). This latter verse is interpreted as referring to one’s granddaughter from the woman he raped (see <i>Yevamot</i> 97a). The verbal analogy teaches that although one’s daughter from the woman he raped is not mentioned in the verse, she too is included with one’s granddaughter, just as a daughter and a granddaughter are equated in Leviticus 18:17. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | lewdness” | Keritot 5a:16 | Furthermore, the punishment for this transgression of intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between: “It is <b>lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), which is written with regard to engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same term <b>“lewdness”</b> that appears elsewhere, which teaches that the transgressor is liable <b>to</b> be put to death by <b>burning.</b> As it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). This teaches that death by burning is the punishment for engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same applies to intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped, due to the verbal analogy of <i>henna</i> and <i>henna</i> linking the two cases. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | zimma , | Nedarim 51a:5 | Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> bar Kappara: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>zimma</i>,</b> lewdness, as in the verse: “They are near kinswomen; it is lewdness [<i>zimma</i>]” (Leviticus 18:17), stated with regard to a man who engages in sexual intercourse with a woman and her daughter? <b>He said to him: Perform for me as</b> you did <b>the previous</b> time. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did</b> so, <b>and</b> bar Kappara <b>said to him</b> that <i>zimma</i> means: <b>What is she [<i>zo ma hi</i>]?</b> This man would be confused about how to refer to his wives; his wife is also his other wife’s mother or daughter. <b>Ben Elasa could not tolerate</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s humiliation, so <b>he and his wife arose and left</b> the wedding. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | henna | Sanhedrin 51a:11 | The Gemara answers that the prohibition of and punishment for intercourse between a father and daughter are not stated explicitly in the Torah; rather, they are derived by means of two verbal analogies. <b>As Rava said: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). This verbal analogy indicates that just as it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with one’s granddaughter and with one’s wife’s daughter or granddaughter, so too, it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with one’s daughter. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “lewdness” | Sanhedrin 51a:12 | Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, so that there be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who engages in intercourse with his daughter or granddaughter is liable to be executed by burning. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | and lewdness is stated there, | Sanhedrin 75a:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Lewdness is stated here,</b> with regard to the punishment: “There shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), <b>and lewdness is stated there,</b> with regard to the prohibition: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen, it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). It is derived by means of a verbal analogy that <b>just as there</b> the prohibition applies to the woman’s <b>daughter, and the daughter of her daughter, and the daughter of her son, so too here,</b> the punishment of burning applies to one who engages in intercourse with the woman’s <b>daughter, and</b> to <b>the daughter of her daughter, and</b> to <b>the daughter of her son.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “ henna ” | Sanhedrin 75b:2 | <b>Rava says: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> The equation of his relative to her relative is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to his relative: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not expose; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to her relative: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). Additionally, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 18:17 | below, | Sanhedrin 75b:6 | <b>Abaye says: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: From where</b> is it derived <b>to render</b> the status of a relative for <b>three generations above,</b> his wife, his mother-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law, <b>like</b> the status of a relative for <b>three generations below,</b> his wife, his daughter, and the daughter of his daughter? <b>Lewdness is stated</b> with regard to relatives <b>below,</b> the offspring of his wife (Leviticus 18:17), <b>and lewdness is stated</b> with regard to relatives <b>above,</b> the ancestors of his wife (Leviticus 20:14). <b>Just as</b> with regard to relatives <b>below,</b> one is liable for engaging in intercourse with <b>three generations</b> of women, <b>so too</b> with regard to relatives <b>above,</b> one is liable for engaging in intercourse with <b>three generations</b> of women. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “ henna ” | Sanhedrin 76a:16 | <b>Rava says: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter who is not the daughter of his wife <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>henna</i>,”</b> written with regard to his descendants: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to the descendants of his wife: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). Then, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 18:17 | henna | Sanhedrin 87b:2 | <b>As Rava says: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>henna</i>,</b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). This verbal analogy indicates that just as intercourse with one’s granddaughter and with one’s wife’s daughter or granddaughter is forbidden, so too, intercourse with one’s daughter is prohibited. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “lewdness” | Sanhedrin 87b:3 | Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, so that there be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who engages in sexual intercourse with his daughter or granddaughter is liable to be executed by burning. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter” | Yevamot 21a:16 | The Gemara challenges that which is stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>His stepson’s daughter</b> is not a secondary relation by rabbinic law. <b>She is</b> forbidden <b>by Torah</b> law, since the daughter of his stepson is the daughter of his wife’s son, <b>as it is written:</b> “You shall not take <b>her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter”</b> (Leviticus 18:17). The Gemara answers: This case was included <b>because</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>wanted to teach the latter clause,</b> which states: <b>His stepson’s wife says to him: I am permitted to you, but my daughter is forbidden to you. And although my daughter is forbidden to you by Torah</b> law, nevertheless <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> forbidding <b>me.</b> Therefore, the case of <b>his stepson’s daughter was also taught in the first clause,</b> even though she is forbidden by Torah law and is not a secondary relation. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter” | Yevamot 22b:20 | <b>As Rava raised a contradiction:</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:10), which implies, <b>consequently,</b> that her <b>son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter is permitted. And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), which states explicitly that her son’s daughter and daughter’s daughter are prohibited. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? |
| Leviticus 18:17 | hena | Yevamot 3a:2 | <b>As Rava said: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>hena</i>,</b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>hena</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10) and the word <b><i>hena</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they [<i>hena</i>] are near kinswomen; it is wickedness” (Leviticus 18:17), indicating that every daughter is prohibited, even one from rape, just like one’s daughter through his wife. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | “wickedness” | Yevamot 3a:3 | Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“wickedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“wickedness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who has sexual intercourse with a daughter from a rape is liable to burning. |
| Leviticus 18:17 | written: “You may not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you may not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, | Yevamot 97a:16 | <b>And it is</b> also <b>written: “You may not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you may not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter,</b> to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen, it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). <b>How so?</b> How can the two verses be reconciled? Evidently, the former verse is stated <b>with regard to rape.</b> A man may marry the daughter or granddaughter of the woman he raped, provided they are not his own offspring. The latter verse is stated <b>with regard to marriage.</b> Marrying the relatives of one’s wife is prohibited. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | “that” is stated there | Horayot 8a:6 | The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word <b>“that” is stated here</b> in the verse: “And the sin that they sinned” (Leviticus 4:14), with regard to the offering brought by the court for the transgression of the public based on their erroneous ruling, <b>and</b> the word <b>“that” is stated there</b> in the verse: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, that is in her lifetime” (Leviticus 18:18), with regard to the prohibition against marrying two sisters. It is derived: <b>Just as there</b> it is <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here,</b> the reference is to <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:18 | as the verse states: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her” | Kiddushin 50b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that betrothal does not take effect if one betroths these two women simultaneously, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). <b>The Torah states: When</b> he betroths them together so <b>that they</b> would <b>become rival wives to one another, he will not be able to take,</b> i.e., betroth, <b>even one of them. Rava said to him: If so,</b> how would you explain <b>this, that it is written</b> at the end of the passage: “Whoever shall do any of these abominations, <b>even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29); <b>if betrothal does not take effect with her,</b> what <b>renders</b> him <b>liable to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]?</b> If he is not betrothed to either woman, and he engages in intercourse with either one, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, as this punishment is incurred for this sin only if he engaged in intercourse with the sister of his wife. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | with karet , she cannot be betrothed | Kiddushin 67b:11 | The Gemara responds: One learns that betrothal is ineffective in this case <b><i>ab initio</i></b> from a different source, as it is <b>derived from</b> the prohibition proscribing <b>a wife’s sister</b> by the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If,</b> with regard to the prohibition proscribing <b>a wife’s sister,</b> whose transgression is punished <b>with <i>karet</i>, she cannot be betrothed</b> by her sister’s husband, in accordance with the verse: “And you shall not take a woman with her sister” (Leviticus 18:18), then with regard to cases that entail <b>liability to</b> receive <b>court-imposed capital punishment,</b> e.g., intercourse with one’s father’s wife, is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that betrothal does not take effect? |
| Leviticus 18:18 | this | Kiddushin 67b:12 | The Gemara suggests another interpretation of the verses. <b>But</b> as the verse has already prohibited betrothal to a wife’s sister, one can <b>say</b> as follows: Both <b>this</b> verse: “You shall not take” (Leviticus 18:18), <b>and that</b> one: “Becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), are referring <b>to a wife’s sister,</b> as <b>this</b> one: “You shall not take,” prohibits this relationship <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> whereas <b>that</b> verse: “Another man’s wife,” teaches that this betrothal is of no effect even <b>after the fact.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> The verse should be interpreted in this manner. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | to be a rival [ litzror ] | Yevamot 13a:3 | § The Gemara returns to the mishna: <b>How do they exempt their rival wives</b> and the rival wives of their rival wives? The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that not only is a rival wife exempt but the rival wife of a rival wife is exempt as well, <b>derived? Rav Yehuda said</b> that this is <b>as the verse states:</b> “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, <b>to be a rival [<i>litzror</i>]</b> to her” (Leviticus 18:18). The term <i>litzror</i> is written, with the letter <i>reish</i> appearing twice, rather than <i>latzor</i>, with a single <i>reish</i>, which means that <b>the Torah amplified</b> and included <b>many rival wives.</b> In other words, this verse includes not only the rival wife of a forbidden relative, but also the rival wife of a rival wife. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | ḥalitza and levirate marriage, as it is stated: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her” | Yevamot 19a:15 | <b>And further, it is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts both of them from</b> both <b><i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage, as it is stated: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). From here it is derived that <b>when</b> two sisters are about to <b>become rival wives one to the other,</b> that is, at the moment they fall before one brother for levirate marriage, <b>you do not have</b> the option of <b>taking even one of them.</b> In other words, levirate marriage to either of them is not permitted, and therefore both are exempt and not only the second. Thus Rava’s explanation is rejected. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | Rabbi Shimon exempts both of them from ḥalitza and from levirate marriage, as it is stated: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her” | Yevamot 28b:23 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts both of them from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage, as it is stated: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). This indicates that <b>at the time that</b> a situation arises wherein <b>they are to become rival wives to each other,</b> e.g., two sisters happen before one <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage, <b>you shall not have</b> the ability <b>to take even one of them</b> in marriage. In his opinion, both women are exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i> at the moment that they happen before the <i>yavam</i>, just as a forbidden relative is exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | We have learned the warning | Yevamot 3b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>We have learned the warning</b> concerning this prohibition that the <i>yavam</i> may not marry his forbidden relative from the verse: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime” (Leviticus 18:18). <b>From where</b> is <b>the punishment</b> that he incurs if he transgresses and marries her derived? <b>The verse states: “For whoever shall do any</b> of these <b>abominations,</b> the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). |
| Leviticus 18:18 | “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime” | Yevamot 3b:6 | § After analyzing the order and language of the mishna, the Gemara discusses the <i>halakhot</i> themselves. <b>From where are these matters,</b> that if one’s forbidden relative comes before him for levirate marriage he is prohibited from marrying her or her rival wife, derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the apparently superfluous phrase: <b>“With her”?</b> |
| Leviticus 18:18 | The verse states: “To be a rival | Yevamot 3b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>she,</b> his wife’s sister, is exempt from levirate marriage; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>her rival wife</b> is also exempt? <b>The verse states: “To be a rival</b> to her” (Leviticus 18:18), which indicates that not only is she prohibited, but so too is her rival wife. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only her rival wife; from where</b> is it derived that <b>the rival wife of her rival wife</b> is also exempt? <b>The verse states: “To be a rival [<i>litzror</i>],”</b> using the full spelling with a double <i>reish</i>, <b>and not <i>latzor</i>;</b> this indicates that there are several rival wives, one after another. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition that entails karet . | Yevamot 8a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>a forbidden relation that</b> a special <b>verse is not necessary</b> to exclude it? The reason must be <b>that a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition that entails <i>karet</i>.</b> If so, <b>a rival wife</b> should <b>also not require an</b> additional <b>verse, due to</b> the fact that <b>a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition that entails <i>karet</i>.</b> The phrase “to be a rival to her” (Leviticus 18:18) teaches that the rival wife of a wife’s sister is prohibited like the wife’s sister herself. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | in her lifetime” | Yevamot 8b:3 | Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to</b> Rava: That is no proof, as the case of <b>a rival wife</b> herself <b>can prove</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is incorrect, <b>as in a place</b> where there is <b>a mitzva she is prohibited and in a place</b> where there is <b>no mitzva she is permitted.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Rami bar Ḥami: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall not take a woman to her sister…<b>in her lifetime”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). This indicates that <b>all</b> cases in which it <b>is in the lifetime</b> of her sister she is forbidden, even when no mitzva applies. |
| Leviticus 18:18 | a woman to her sister” | Yevamot 8b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> phrase <b>“in her lifetime” is necessary,</b> as indicated by the plain meaning of the phrase, <b>to exclude the time after death,</b> i.e., to teach that a wife’s sister is forbidden only while the wife is still alive, whereas after her death the sister is permitted. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> that a woman is permitted after her sister’s death <b>is derived from</b> “and you shall not take <b>a woman to her sister”</b> (Leviticus 18:18), as when one of them is dead it is no longer considered “a woman to her sister.” |
| Leviticus 18:18 | And it is written: “To uncover her nakedness” | Yevamot 8b:6 | § <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara suggests a different interpretation. <b>Rav Huna bar Taḥlifa said in the name of Rava: Two verses are written,</b> i.e., two separate issues are mentioned in the same verse. <b>It is written: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival [<i>litzror</i>],”</b> which indicates that two rival wives are prohibited. <b>And it is written: “To uncover her nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:18), in the singular, <b>which means one</b> and not both of them. <b>How is it</b> possible to reconcile this apparent contradiction? <b>In a place</b> where there is <b>a mitzva</b> of levirate marriage, <b>both</b> the forbidden relation and her rival wife <b>are prohibited. In a place</b> where there is <b>no mitzva</b> of levirate marriage, the forbidden relation <b>is prohibited but her rival wife is permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:18 | to permit, and this is what the Merciful One is saying: “You shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival” | Yevamot 8b:8 | <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: From where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> superfluous phrase <b>“with her,”</b> comes <b>to prohibit,</b> i.e., although there is an obligation that “her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her,” a wife’s sister remains prohibited? <b>Perhaps</b> it serves <b>to permit, and this is what the Merciful One is saying: “You shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival”</b> (Leviticus 18:18), i.e., <b>neither her nor her rival wife.</b> When is this the case? It is <b>in a place where</b> the obligation of “her brother-in-law will have intercourse <b>with her”</b> does <b>not</b> apply. <b>However, in a place where “with her” does apply</b> and there is an obligation of levirate marriage, <b>both of them are permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:19 | as long as she is impure by her menstruation” | Keritot 2b:28 | The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>From where does</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak learn <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions and teach that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each violation of the prohibition against forbidden intercourse? Unlike Rabbi Yoḥanan, he cannot derive it from the above verse, as he learns this aforementioned <i>halakha</i> from that verse. The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall not approach a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness <b>as long as she is impure by her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 18:19). Since the verse could have stated simply: And you shall not approach a menstruating woman, the lengthy expression of: “A woman…as long as she is impure by her menstruation,” serves <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render him liable to receive a punishment <b>for each and every woman</b> with whom he engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse. |
| Leviticus 18:19 | a woman | Keritot 9a:31 | Rabbi Ḥanina further asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> there is halakhic significance to the <b>separate bodies</b> in the case <b>of</b> an espoused <b>maidservant?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Did you not state with regard to those with whom relations are forbidden</b> that when the verse states: <b>“And</b> you shall not approach unto <b>a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness” (Leviticus 18:19), this serves <b>to</b> require <b>separate</b> offerings <b>for each and every woman</b> with whom one committed unwitting transgressions? <b>With regard to</b> an espoused <b>maidservant it is also</b> similarly <b>written: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman,</b> |
| Leviticus 18:19 | “And to a woman in the separation of her impurity | Makkot 14a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> that one who is liable to receive <i>karet</i> is not flogged from the fact that <i>karet</i> for one who engages in intercourse with his sister emerged from the generalization, <b>from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive the concept <b>to divide</b> the various prohibitions? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse written with regard to a menstruating woman: <b>“And to a woman in the separation of her impurity</b> you shall not approach” (Leviticus 18:19). From the superfluous expression “and to a woman,” Rabbi Yitzḥak derives <b>that one is liable for</b> intercourse with <b>each and every</b> forbidden <b>woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:19 | did not show respect to the Torah. The Torah said: “And to a woman in the separation of her impurity you should not approach” | Shabbat 13b:1 | <b>and served Torah scholars extensively, why did he die at half his days?</b> Where is the length of days promised him in the verse? <b>No one would respond to her</b> astonishment <b>at all.</b> Eliyahu said: <b>One time I was a guest in her</b> house, <b>and she was relating that entire event</b> with regard to the death of her husband. <b>And I said to her: My daughter, during the period of your menstruation, how</b> did <b>he</b> act <b>toward you? She said to me: Heaven forbid, he did not touch me even with</b> his <b>little finger.</b> And I asked her: <b>In the days of your white</b> garments, after the menstrual flow ended, and you were just counting clean days, <b>how did he act toward you</b> then? She said to me: <b>He ate with me, and drank with me, and slept with me with bodily contact and,</b> however, <b>it did not enter his mind about something else,</b> i.e., conjugal relations. <b>And I said to her: Blessed is the Omnipresent who killed him</b> for this sin, <b>as</b> your husband <b>did not show respect to the Torah. The Torah said: “And to a woman in the separation of her impurity you should not approach”</b> (Leviticus 18:19), even mere affectionate contact is prohibited. The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> That student did not actually sleep with her with bodily contact; rather, <b>it was</b> in <b>one bed</b> that they slept without contact. <b>In the West,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said:</b> When they would sleep together in one bed, she wore <b>a belt [<i>sinar</i>]</b> from the waist down that <b>would separate between him and her.</b> Nevertheless, since the matter is prohibited, that student was punished. |
| Leviticus 18:19 | “And a woman who is impure by her uncleanness [ nidda ] you shall not approach, | Shevuot 18b:4 | § <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosei ben Lakonya asked Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya: From where in the Torah</b> is the <b>prohibition concerning one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman [<i>nidda</i>]</b> derived? Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya <b>took a clod [<i>kala</i>]</b> of earth <b>and threw</b> it <b>at him</b> in reproach and said to him: Is there a need to search the Torah for a derivation for the <b>prohibition concerning one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman?</b> The verse states: <b>“And a woman who is impure by her uncleanness [<i>nidda</i>] you shall not approach,</b> to uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:19)? |
| Leviticus 18:19 | you shall not approach, | Shevuot 18b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for <b>a positive mitzva</b> with regard to the manner in which one must withdraw from a menstruating woman; <b>from where do we</b> derive that immediate withdrawal is also subject to <b>a prohibition? Rav Pappa said: The verse states:</b> “And a woman who is impure by her uncleanness <b>you shall not approach,</b> to uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:19). The Gemara explains: <b>“You shall not approach [<i>tikrav</i>]”</b> means <b>also</b> the opposite: <b>You shall not withdraw, as it is written: “Those who say: Withdraw [<i>kerav</i>] to yourself, come not near to me, for I am holier than you”</b> (Isaiah 65:5), where “<i>kerav</i>” means remove or withdraw. |
| Leviticus 18:19 | as long as she is impure by her uncleanness” | Yevamot 55a:19 | The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse <b>“And</b> you shall not approach <b>a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness <b>as long as she is impure by her uncleanness”</b> (Leviticus 18:19), which serves <b>to render</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for each and every woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:20 | “cohabitation with seed” | Yevamot 55b:5 | § <b>Rava said:</b> Now that it has been established that the initial stage of intercourse is considered an act of sexual intercourse, <b>why do I</b> need the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20) <b>that the Merciful One writes with regard to a designated maidservant;</b> the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Leviticus 18:20) written <b>with regard to a married woman;</b> and the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Numbers 5:13) written with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> |
| Leviticus 18:21 | “And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh” | Megillah 25a:15 | We learned in the mishna: If <b>one says,</b> while translating the verse: <b>“And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21): And you shall not give any of your seed to impregnate an Aramean woman, he is silenced with rebuke. A Sage <b>from the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> One who translates the verse in this manner maintains that <b>the verse speaks of a Jew who has relations with a gentile woman and fathered from her a son</b> who will be raised to engage in <b>idol worship.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:21 | “And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh” | Megillah 25a:2 | If <b>one modifies</b> the text while reading the laws of <b>forbidden sexual relations,</b> i.e., he introduces euphemisms out of a sense of propriety, <b>they silence him.</b> Similarly, if <b>one says</b> while translating the verse: <b>“And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21): And <b>you shall not give</b> any of your seed <b>to impregnate an Aramean woman, he is silenced with rebuke.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:21 | as it is stated: “And you shall not give any of your offspring to pass them over to Molekh” | Sanhedrin 64b:1 | § <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> One is <b>not liable</b> for passing his child through fire to Molekh <b>unless he hands him over to</b> the <b>priests</b> of Molekh, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall not give any of your offspring to pass them over to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21), which indicates that the prohibition is to give, i.e., to hand the child over to the priests. |
| Leviticus 18:22 | Isn’t it written: “The manners in which one lies with a woman” | Horayot 4a:15 | The Gemara says: Rather, it is a case <b>where they said:</b> Intercourse with her <b>in the typical manner</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> but intercourse <b>in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written: “The manners in which one lies with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22), in the plural, indicating that both intercourse in a typical manner and intercourse in an atypical manner are manners in which one lies with a woman? |
| Leviticus 18:22 | verses, from: “And you shall not lie with a man | Keritot 3a:14 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you would say</b> the entire mishna <b>is</b> in fact in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> listed in <b>the first clause he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that is not tenable, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Abbahu say:</b> In the case of a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male, and</b> a male <b>who brings</b> another <b>male upon him</b> to engage in intercourse, <b>according to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who derives</b> these prohibitions <b>from two</b> separate <b>verses, from: “And you shall not lie with a man</b> as with a woman” (Leviticus 18:22), <b>and from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18), which is referring to one who engages in homosexual intercourse passively, one who transgresses both of these prohibitions in a single lapse of awareness is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. |
| Leviticus 18:22 | And furthermore, it is written: “Lyings with a woman” | Kiddushin 22b:18 | The Gemara asks: If he engages in intercourse <b>in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, with her, <b>what can be said?</b> In that case the woman does not benefit from the intercourse. <b>Rav Aḥai bar Adda of</b> the place called <b>Aḥa said: Who will tell us,</b> i.e., it is not obvious, <b>that there is no benefit for both of them,</b> i.e., there is benefit only for the man, when they engage in intercourse in an atypical manner? <b>And furthermore, it is written: “Lyings with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). The plural form indicates that there are two ways of engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman: In this manner <b>the verse compares typical</b> sexual intercourse <b>to</b> intercourse in <b>an atypical manner.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:22 | with a male | Sanhedrin 54a:11 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>this</b> prohibition against homosexual intercourse with one’s father <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And</b> you shall not lie <b>with a male</b> as with a woman; it is an abomination” (Leviticus 18:22)? The Gemara answers: The prohibition is stated specifically with regard to one’s father in order <b>to render him liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings for unwittingly engaging in intercourse with his father. |
| Leviticus 18:22 | The verse states: “And you shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination” | Sanhedrin 54b:1 | <b>We have learned</b> the <b>punishment</b> for homosexual intercourse, but <b>from where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “And you shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). |
| Leviticus 18:22 | “as with a woman” | Sanhedrin 55a:6 | The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of intercourse with a male,</b> what is the question? The expression <b>“as with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22) <b>is written with regard to him,</b> which indicates that any act that is considered an act of intercourse with a woman is also considered an act of intercourse with a man. <b>Rather,</b> the question is as follows: With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of intercourse with an animal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? |
| Leviticus 18:22 | male homosexual intercourse, and likewise it says: “You shall not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination” | Sanhedrin 82a:2 | <b>Rav</b> then <b>remembered</b> that which he learned through <b>tradition</b> and said: <b>“Judah has dealt treacherously,” this</b> is a reference to the sin of <b>idol worship. And likewise it says:</b> But as a wife who treacherously departs her husband, <b>you have dealt treacherously with Me, house of Israel, says the Lord</b> (Jeremiah 3:20). <b>“And an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem,” this</b> is a reference to <b>male homosexual intercourse, and likewise it says: “You shall not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). <b>“As Judah has profaned the sacred [<i>kodesh</i>] of the Lord,” this</b> is a reference to <b>a prostitute, and likewise it says: “There shall be no harlot [<i>kedesha</i>] of the daughters of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). <b>“And has engaged in intercourse with the daughter of a strange god,” this</b> is a reference to <b>one who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:22 | it is written: “The cohabitations of a woman” | Sotah 26b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term: <b>Something else? Rav Sheshet said:</b> This <b>excludes</b> a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>issued a warning to</b> his wife not to engage in sexual intercourse <b>in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, with another man, and teaches that this is not considered a valid warning. <b>Rava said to</b> Rav Sheshet: Intercourse <b>in an atypical manner</b> is considered sexual intercourse, as <b>it is written: “The cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22), indicating that there are two forms of sexual intercourse with a woman, vaginal and anal, and there is no halakhic differentiation between them. |
| Leviticus 18:22 | as with a woman” | Yevamot 54b:9 | The Gemara answers that it is needed <b>for the dilemma that Ravina raised before Rava:</b> With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of intercourse with</b> another <b>male, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered to be a forbidden act of homosexual intercourse? The Gemara is puzzled by this dilemma: <b>With regard to a male, it is written</b> explicitly: “You shall not lie with a man <b>as with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22), which indicates that anything considered an act of sexual intercourse with a woman is also considered an act of sexual intercourse with a man. |
| Leviticus 18:22 | said to him: It is written: “The cohabitations of a woman” | Yevamot 55b:8 | The Gemara addresses the third case: <b>Why do I need</b> the expression cohabitation with seed in the context of <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> It is needed <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the expression <b>a cohabitation with seed excludes something else.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>something else? Rav Sheshet said: It excludes</b> a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>was jealous with regard to her</b> and warned her not to seclude herself and have <b>atypical,</b> i.e., anal, sexual intercourse with another man. <b>Rava</b> objected to this explanation and <b>said to him: It is written: “The cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22), indicating that there are two types of intercourse with a woman, and the same <i>halakha</i> applies to both. |
| Leviticus 18:22 | “The cohabitations of a woman” | Yevamot 56b:4 | <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>And so too?</b> It is referring <b>to atypical,</b> i.e., anal, <b>sexual intercourse with those with whom relations are prohibited [<i>arayot</i>].</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>On the contrary, the main</b> source that atypical intercourse is considered intercourse, which is based upon the verse <b>“The cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22) <b>is written with regard to those with whom relations are prohibited [<i>arayot</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 18:22 | “And you shall not lie with a male as with a woman [ mishkevei isha ]” | Yevamot 83b:10 | The Gemara answers that Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Simai says:</b> With regard to <b>a hermaphrodite, one is liable to</b> be punished with <b>stoning on his account</b> for intercourse <b>at two places.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Simai? Rava said:</b> The Sage <b>bar Hamedurei explained</b> the matter <b>to me,</b> based on an allusion to this <i>halakha</i> found in the Bible. The verse states: <b>“And you shall not lie with a male as with a woman [<i>mishkevei isha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). The phrase <i>mishkevei isha</i>, referring to lying with a woman, appears in the plural. Now, <b>what male has two</b> manners of <b>lying? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a hermaphrodite,</b> and the plural form <i>mishkevei</i>, meaning: Lyings, indicates that there is liability for both manners of intercourse with him. |
| Leviticus 18:23 | One who copulates with an animal, | Keritot 3a:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and with regard to</b> one who <b>blasphemes he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also teach</b> two additional cases with regard to bestiality: <b>One who copulates with an animal,</b> derived from the verse: “And you shall not lie with any beast” (Leviticus 18:23); <b>and</b> a man <b>who brings an animal upon him</b> for bestiality, derived from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:18), which can be interpreted as applying to all forms of male anal intercourse, including with animals. |
| Leviticus 18:23 | tevel , | Nedarim 51a:4 | When they came <b>to</b> drink <b>another cup,</b> bar Kappara <b>said to him: What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> perversion, as in the verse: “Neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto; it is perversion [<i>tevel</i>]” (Leviticus 18:23)? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> various explanations <b>to him, as</b> he did <b>the previous</b> time, which were all refuted again by bar Kappara. Bar Kappara then <b>said to him: Perform for me</b> as you did before, so <b>that I will tell you.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did</b> so. Bar Kappara then <b>said to him</b> that the phrase: <b>“It is <i>tevel</i>”</b> means: Does <b>it have</b> any <b>spice [<i>tevalin yesh bah</i>]? Is this act of sexual intercourse</b> with an animal <b>different than all other acts of sexual intercourse,</b> which would cause one to engage in such a repulsive action? |
| Leviticus 18:23 | matter of one who engages in bestiality | Sanhedrin 54b:17 | <b>Abaye says: Even according to the statement of Rabbi Yishmael</b> he is <b>liable</b> for transgressing <b>two</b> prohibitions, <b>as it is written: “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death.” If</b> the verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of one who engages in bestiality</b> actively, as this prohibition is stated explicitly in the verse: “And you shall not lie with any animal” (Leviticus 18:23), <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of one who engages in bestiality</b> passively. <b>And</b> it is derived from the fact that <b>the Merciful One expresses</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of one who engages in bestiality</b> passively <b>using the term</b> for <b>one who engages in bestiality</b> actively: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>one who engages in bestiality</b> actively the Torah both <b>punishes</b> for this act <b>and prohibits</b> it, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>one who engages in bestiality</b> passively, the Torah both <b>punishes</b> for this act <b>and prohibits</b> it. |
| Leviticus 18:23 | The verse states: “And you shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it” | Sanhedrin 54b:7 | <b>We have</b> therefore <b>learned</b> the <b>punishment for both one who engages in bestiality</b> actively <b>and one who engages in bestiality</b> passively, but <b>from where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “And you shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it”</b> (Leviticus 18:23). |
| Leviticus 18:24 | “Do not impurify yourselves with all these” | Makkot 24a:16 | The Sages <b>said to him: Is it written: He who performs all these?</b> Rather, the phrase <b>“he who performs these” is written,</b> indicating that one is blessed <b>even in</b> a case where he performed <b>one of them. As if you do not say so,</b> compare that to <b>a different verse</b> that <b>is written</b> with regard to severe transgressions punishable by <i>karet</i>: <b>“Do not impurify yourselves with all these”</b> (Leviticus 18:24). Would you say that <b>there too</b> it means that it is <b>one who comes into contact with all these who becomes impure,</b> but <b>one who comes into contact with one of these, no,</b> he does not become impure? <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> that the phrase “with all these” means: <b>With one of all these? Here too</b> it means that one who performs <b>one of all these</b> has a place in the World-to-Come. |
| Leviticus 18:24 | “Do not become defiled with all of these” | Sanhedrin 81a:11 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabban Gamliel in an attempt to console him: <b>If that is so,</b> that the term “all” is understood in that manner, with regard to that which is written concerning the forbidden relatives enumerated in the Torah: <b>“Do not become defiled with all of these”</b> (Leviticus 18:24), would you also say that there <b>too,</b> one who is <b>in</b> violation of <b>all of</b> the prohibitions, <b>yes,</b> he is punished, but one who is <b>in</b> violation of <b>one of them, no,</b> he is not punished? <b>Rather,</b> clearly, “all of these” means <b>in</b> violation of <b>one of all these;</b> therefore, here <b>too,</b> the verse in Ezekiel: “And has kept all My statutes,” means that <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>one of all these</b> one merits eternal life. |
| Leviticus 18:24 | those with whom relations are forbidden | Yevamot 11a:10 | What is the reason for this? The term <b>defilement is written in that</b> passage dealing with an unfaithful wife: “She being defiled secretly” (Numbers 5:13), just <b>as</b> defilement is written with regard to <b>those with whom relations are forbidden</b> in the verse: “Defile not yourselves in any of these things, for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you” (Leviticus 18:24). This teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of an unfaithful wife is like that of a woman with whom relations are forbidden; both she and her rival wife are exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Leviticus 18:25 | And it is written: “And the land was defiled, therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof upon it, | Shabbat 33a:5 | <b>Due to the sin of prohibited sexual relations, and idol worship, and</b> failure to let the land <b>lie fallow</b> during <b>the Sabbatical and Jubilee Years, exile comes to the world and they exile</b> the Jewish people from their land, <b>and others come and settle in their place. As it is stated</b> with regard to illicit sexual relations: <b>“For all these abominations have the men of the land done,</b> that were before you, and the land is defiled; that the land expel not you also, when you defile it, as it expelled the nation that was before you” (Leviticus 18:27–28). <b>And it is written: “And the land was defiled, therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof upon it,</b> and the land expelled her inhabitants” (Leviticus 18:25). <b>And it is written: “That the land expel not you also, when you defile it,</b> as it expelled the nation that was before you.” |
| Leviticus 18:27 | “ El ,” | Bava Batra88b:6 | § <b>Rabbi Levi says: The punishment for</b> using false <b>measures is more severe than the punishment for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>forbidden sexual relations. As</b> in <b>that</b> case, forbidden relations, it <b>is stated with regard to them</b> a shortened term for the word “these”: <b>“<i>El</i>,”</b> in the verse: “For all these [<i>el</i> ] abominations” (Leviticus 18:27). <b>And</b> in <b>this</b> case, false measures, it <b>is stated</b> an expanded term for the word “these”: <b>“<i>Elleh</i>,”</b> in the verse: “For all that do these [<i>elleh</i>] things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 25:16). <b>And from where may it be inferred that this</b> expression <b>“<i>el</i>”</b> indicates that the prohibition <b>is severe,</b> based on which it is understood that the form this word takes indicates a level of severity? <b>As it is written: “And the mighty [<i>eilei</i>] of the land he took away”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13). |
| Leviticus 18:27 | “For all these abominations | Sotah 4b:12 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says:</b> Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he engaged in sexual intercourse with all</b> of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5), <b>and it is written there,</b> at the end of the passage concerning forbidden sexual relationships: <b>“For all these abominations</b> have the men of the land done” (Leviticus 18:27). |
| Leviticus 18:27 | “For all these abominations have the men of the land done” | Yevamot 21a:4 | § <b>Rava said: Where</b> is the prohibition against <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationships hinted at in the Torah? As it is stated</b> at the end of the portion discussing forbidden incestuous relations: <b>“For all these abominations have the men of the land done”</b> (Leviticus 18:27). <b>“These”</b> must be understood to mean <b>the harsh ones,</b> i.e., the severe transgressions. This proves <b>by inference that there are</b> also lesser transgressions that are, as it were, <b>soft ones. And what are those</b> soft ones? They are <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationships.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:29 | these [ elleh ] | Bava Batra88b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to forbidden relations isn’t it also written:</b> “For whosoever shall do any of <b>these [<i>elleh</i>]</b> abominations” (Leviticus 18:29)? If so, why is the punishment for using false measures considered harsher? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> expression of “<i>elleh</i>” (Leviticus 18:29) in the context of forbidden relations does not serve to emphasize its severity. Rather, it serves <b>to exclude</b> one who uses deception in <b>measures from</b> the penalty of <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 18:29 | “Even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” | Bava Kamma32a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is she not</b> considered an active participant? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to forbidden sexual intercourse: <b>“Even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29), indicating that both the man and woman are considered to be performing an action? |
| Leviticus 18:29 | those with whom relations are forbidden: | Bekhorot 56b:4 | The Gemara clarifies Abaye’s opinion. An animal given to <b>a gentile prostitute</b> is considered <b>payment</b> to a prostitute, which is <b>prohibited</b> for sacrifice on the altar, as Abaye <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“abomination”</b> stated with regard to payment to a prostitute: “You shall not bring the payment of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the House of the Lord your God for any vow, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19), and the word <b>“abomination”</b> stated <b>in</b> the verses discussing <b>those with whom relations are forbidden:</b> “For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). |
| Leviticus 18:29 | shall be cut off | Keritot 2b:18 | The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the prohibitions against engaging in forbidden intercourse: <b>Granted, you cannot say</b> that one who unwittingly violates every prohibition against engaging in forbidden intercourse is <b>entirely exempt, as it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them <b>shall be cut off</b> from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), and as they all are punishable by <i>karet</i> he is liable to bring a sin offering for his unwitting transgression. <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that if he <b>transgressed one</b> prohibition <b>he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering, and likewise if he <b>transgressed all of them in one lapse of awareness</b> he <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, | Keritot 2b:26 | <b>Rabbi Yona said</b> in response, <b>and some say</b> this was stated by <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>Since this is a juxtaposition,</b> it means that in this verse <b>all of those with whom relations are forbidden are juxtaposed to</b> the case of <b>one’s sister,</b> written in that passage, as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>one’s sister</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her alone, so too,</b> with regard to any one of <b>all</b> the cases of forbidden relations, one is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with that woman <b>alone.</b> When a <i>halakha</i> is derived by juxtaposition the cases do not have to be entirely similar. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | were included in | Keritot 2b:27 | The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> this presents a difficulty <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the people who commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> incurred by engaging in intercourse with <b>one’s sister singled out</b> in Leviticus 20:17? It was singled out <b>to judge it,</b> so that the transgressors receive the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i> and not</b> the punishment <b>of lashes.</b> Although they have violated a prohibition, which generally carries the punishment of lashes, they are not flogged, as they are liable to receive the more severe punishment of <i>karet</i>. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | separate prohibitions | Keritot 3a:4 | The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But</b> accordingly, <b>once</b> there are <b>separate prohibitions</b> stated in the Torah with regard to engaging in intercourse with all forbidden relatives (Leviticus, chapter 18), and at the conclusion of that passage it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), it is indicated that the punishments of <i>karet</i> or a sin offering apply to all these prohibitions. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s sister,</b> in a separate passage: “And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:17)? |
| Leviticus 18:29 | even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” | Kiddushin 50b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that betrothal does not take effect if one betroths these two women simultaneously, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). <b>The Torah states: When</b> he betroths them together so <b>that they</b> would <b>become rival wives to one another, he will not be able to take,</b> i.e., betroth, <b>even one of them. Rava said to him: If so,</b> how would you explain <b>this, that it is written</b> at the end of the passage: “Whoever shall do any of these abominations, <b>even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29); <b>if betrothal does not take effect with her,</b> what <b>renders</b> him <b>liable to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]?</b> If he is not betrothed to either woman, and he engages in intercourse with either one, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, as this punishment is incurred for this sin only if he engaged in intercourse with the sister of his wife. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | “Whoever shall do any of these abominations shall be cut off” | Kiddushin 67b:16 | <b>Rather,</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that betrothal is ineffective for other forbidden relatives, is derived from a different source, as <b>Rabbi Yona says, and some say</b> this was taught by <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states</b> explicitly in the chapter dealing with forbidden relatives: <b>“Whoever shall do any of these abominations shall be cut off”</b> (Leviticus 18:29). In this verse <b>all those with whom relations are forbidden are juxtaposed</b> to one another, and therefore also <b>to a wife’s sister: Just as betrothal is not effective</b> in the case of <b>a wife’s sister, so too, betrothal is not effective with regard to all those with whom relations are forbidden.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:29 | generalization: | Makkot 13b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that like those liable to be executed, those liable to receive <i>karet</i> are not flogged. <b>Those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for incest <b>were</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>generalization:</b> “For anyone who performs any of these abominations, the souls who do so shall be excised [<i>venikhretu</i>] from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). Included in that category is one who engages in intercourse with his sister. <b>And why</b> then did the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>karet</i> with regard to</b> intercourse with <b>one’s sister emerge</b> from the generalization and receive specific mention: “And a man who takes his sister…and they shall be excised before the eyes of the children of their people” (Leviticus 20:17)? It is in order <b>to sentence one</b> who engages in intercourse with his sister <b>with <i>karet</i>, and not with lashes.</b> This is the source for the opinion that those liable to receive <i>karet</i> are not flogged. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | were included in | Makkot 14a:2 | § It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For anyone who performs any of these abominations, the souls who do so shall be excised from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> when administered to one who engages in intercourse <b>with his sister, excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence him</b> to be punished <b>with <i>karet</i> and not to</b> be punished <b>with lashes.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:29 | shall be excised” | Makkot 23a:20 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel says: And if</b> for <b>one who performs one transgression his soul is taken for it,</b> as one’s soul can be uprooted from the world for one transgression, for <b>one who performs a single mitzva,</b> it is <b>all the more so</b> the case <b>that his soul will be given to him,</b> as the reward for performing mitzvot is greater than the punishment for performing transgressions. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is derived from its</b> own <b>place</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is stated</b> at the conclusion of the passage discussing intercourse with forbidden relatives, which is punishable with <i>karet</i>: <b>“And the souls that perform</b> them <b>shall be excised”</b> (Leviticus 18:29), <b>and it states</b> toward the beginning of that chapter: |
| Leviticus 18:29 | were included in | Makkot 23b:5 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> There is no proof from here that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who says: There are no lashes in</b> cases of <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of forbidden relations <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the people who commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> in the case of relations with <b>one’s sister excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence</b> one who transgresses a prohibition punishable with <i>karet</i> <b>to</b> be punished <b>with <i>karet</i></b> alone, <b>and not with lashes.</b> Other Sages disagree with Rabbi Yitzḥak (see 13b). |
| Leviticus 18:29 | were included in | Megillah 7b:21 | <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> There is no proof from here that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said: There are no lashes in</b> cases of <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the persons that commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> administered to <b>one’s sister excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence her to</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> and not to</b> the punishment of <b>lashes.</b> This serves as a paradigm; wherever one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, there are no lashes. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | an abomination, | Temurah 29b:13 | <b>And Levi says: Even</b> the payment for intercourse with <b>one’s menstruating wife</b> is considered payment to a prostitute and is prohibited to be sacrificed on the altar. <b>What is the reason? It is written “abomination”</b> in the above verse, <b>and this</b> intercourse with one’s menstruating wife <b>is</b> also called <b>an abomination,</b> as it is written with regard to those with whom relations are forbidden, including a menstruating wife: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations” (Leviticus 18:29). |
| Leviticus 18:29 | “For whoever shall do any of these abominations” | Temurah 29b:18 | <b>What is the reason? It is written here,</b> with regard to payment to a prostitute, <b>“abomination,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to forbidden sexual relations: <b>“For whoever shall do any of these abominations”</b> (Leviticus 18:29). <b>Just as there</b> the verse is referring to <b>those with whom relations are forbidden</b> and <b>with whom betrothal does not take effect, so too,</b> the prohibition of payment to a prostitute is referring to a woman <b>with whom betrothal does not take effect,</b> including a gentile. |
| Leviticus 18:29 | eleh is also written: | Yevamot 21a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to forbidden relationships</b> the word <b><i>eleh</i> is also written:</b> “For whosoever shall do any of these [<i>eleh</i>] abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). If so, why is the punishment for using dishonest measures considered harsher? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> expression meaning these [<i>eleh</i>] in the context of forbidden relations does not emphasize their severity; rather, it comes <b>to exclude</b> one who uses deception in <b>measures from</b> the penalty of <b><i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:29 | abominations, | Yevamot 3b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>We have learned the warning</b> concerning this prohibition that the <i>yavam</i> may not marry his forbidden relative from the verse: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime” (Leviticus 18:18). <b>From where</b> is <b>the punishment</b> that he incurs if he transgresses and marries her derived? <b>The verse states: “For whoever shall do any</b> of these <b>abominations,</b> the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). |
| Leviticus 18:29 | “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off” | Yevamot 54b:3 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara offers another source for the <i>halakha</i> that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse. <b>Rabbi Yona said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states</b> at the end of the chapter on forbidden relations: <b>“For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off”</b> (Leviticus 18:29). <b>All those with whom relations are forbidden are compared</b> to each other in this verse, and therefore also <b>to a menstruating woman,</b> who is mentioned in that chapter. Consequently, <b>just as</b> one is liable to receive punishment for having sexual intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> from the time of <b>the initial stage of intercourse, so too,</b> one violates <b>all</b> prohibitions against engaging in forbidden relations from the time of <b>the initial stage of intercourse.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:29 | shall be cut off | Yevamot 8a:6 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the suggestion that other women with whom relations are forbidden are permitted in levirate marriage <b>is derived from the juxtaposition of Rabbi Yona. As Rabbi Yona said, and some say</b> this was stated by <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them <b>shall be cut off</b> from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). In this verse <b>all of</b> the women <b>with whom relations are forbidden are juxtaposed with</b> the case of <b>a brother’s wife.</b> Consequently, one might say that <b>just as a brother’s wife is permitted</b> in levirate marriage, <b>so too, all</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden are likewise permitted.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “With her,”</b> which excludes the prohibition with regard to a wife’s sister. |
| Leviticus 18:30 | “And you shall observe My charge” | Chagigah 11b:14 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation, and suggests that the prohibition against teaching three is derived <b>from the</b> following <b>verse</b> stated with regard to forbidden sexual relations: <b>“And you shall observe My charge”</b> (Leviticus 18:30), which is explained as follows: <b>“And you shall observe [<i>ushmartem</i>],”</b> in the plural, indicates at least <b>two; “My charge”</b> is <b>one; and the Merciful One states</b> at the conclusion of this verse: “That you <b>do not perform any of these abominable customs”</b> (Leviticus 18:30), indicating that this topic may not be taught to three. |
| Leviticus 18:30 | “And you shall keep My charge” | Moed Katan5a:21 | <b>Mar Zutra said</b> that an allusion to this obligation is found in the verse <b>“Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:31), which indicates that people must be warned to stay away from that which could cause them to become ritually impure. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall keep My charge”</b> (Leviticus 18:30), which means that you must <b>establish a safeguard for My charge,</b> i.e., protective measures must be enacted to prevent people from transgressing <i>halakha</i>, a task that includes distancing people from ritual impurity by marking off graves, so that they not come to convey ritual impurity to <i>teruma</i> or other consecrated items. |
| Leviticus 18:30 | and not to render yourself impure through them” | Shevuot 7b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that each of these sins is referred to as impurity: <b>With regard to idol worship</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “For he had given his offspring to Molekh <b>in order to render impure My Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 20:3). <b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations</b> the verse <b>states: “You shall safeguard My charge not to do any of the abominable traditions</b> that were done before you <b>and not to render yourself impure through them”</b> (Leviticus 18:30). <b>With regard to bloodshed</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “The land will not atone for the blood that was spilled on it except through the blood of the one who spilled it; <b>you shall not render the land impure”</b> (Numbers 35:34). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the goat</b> offering <b>would atone for these three</b> types of <b>impurities.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “From the impurities of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities <b>but not</b> for <b>all impurities.</b> |
| Leviticus 18:30 | “Therefore shall you protect [ ushmartem ] My prized possession [ mishmarti ], | Yevamot 21a:12 | <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that the prohibition of secondary forbidden relationships is alluded to <b>from here,</b> in the verse stated at the conclusion of the verses discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of forbidden relationships: <b>“Therefore shall you protect [<i>ushmartem</i>] My prized possession [<i>mishmarti</i>],</b> that you do not any of these abominable customs” (Leviticus 18:30). This means: <b>Establish a safeguard [<i>mishmeret</i>] for My prized possession.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:2 | and a positive mitzva: | Bava Metzia32a:15 | The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that a priest must not obey his father’s command to become impure is <b>because the Merciful One writes: “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>;</b> I am the Lord”; <b>but</b> if <b>it were not so, I would say</b> that the child <b>must obey him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why? This</b> obligation to obey a parent is <b>a positive mitzva,</b> as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12), <b>and that</b> obligation of a priest to refrain from becoming impure is both <b>a prohibition:</b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 19:2); <b>and</b> the principle is that <b>a positive mitzva does not come and override a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:2 | “You shall be holy” | Zevachim 28a:19 | <b>Rather, Abaye said: When Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi came,</b> he said that <b>Rav says:</b> Shmuel was actually referring to two separate verses. And he <b>relied on that which the <i>tanna</i> taught:</b> The verse is seemingly redundant <b>when it states:</b> “And if it be eaten at all on the <b>third</b> day, it is <i>piggul</i>; it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 19:7), <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 19:2), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated: “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day</b>…it shall be <i>piggul</i>” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 19:3 | as it is stated: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father, and you shall observe My Shabbatot ; I am the Lord” | Bava Metzia32a:14 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And if</b> the animal <b>was</b> lost <b>in a graveyard</b> and was found by a priest, <b>he may not become impure to</b> return <b>it.</b> In a case where a priest’s father said to him: Become impure, or in a case where one was obligated to return the animal and his father said to him: Do not return it, he may not listen to his father. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a priest’s <b>father said to him: Become impure, or that</b> if one’s father <b>said to him: Do not return</b> a lost item that you found; <b>he should not listen to him?</b> It is derived from the verse, <b>as it is stated: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father, and you shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>; I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:3). From the fact that the verse concludes: “I am the Lord,” it is derived that: <b>You are all,</b> parent and child alike, <b>obligated in My honor.</b> Therefore, if a parent commands his child to refrain from observing a mitzva, he must not obey the command. |
| Leviticus 19:3 | the verse states: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father” | Keritot 28a:29 | Likewise, mention of <b>the father precedes</b> that of <b>the mother</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the honor of the father takes precedence over the honor of the mother.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), with the order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal. But the Sages said:</b> Honor of <b>the father takes precedence over</b> honor of <b>the mother everywhere, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both the son <b>and his mother are obligated in the honor of his father.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:3 | “A man | Kiddushin 29a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>All mitzvot of a son with regard to</b> his <b>father? If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>all mitzvot that the son is obligated to perform with regard to</b> his <b>father,</b> are <b>women exempt</b> from obligations of this kind? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a verse that deals with the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother: <b>“A man</b> shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3)? <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is obligated in this mitzva. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> is also obligated? <b>When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“A man shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), employing the plural form of the verb, this indicates that <b>there are two</b> that are obligated <b>here,</b> both a man and a woman. |
| Leviticus 19:3 | “A man | Kiddushin 30b:16 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>each mitzva</b> for <b>the father that is incumbent upon the son to perform for his father, both men and women are obligated</b> in them. The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: <b>“A man</b> shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is obligated in this mitzva; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> is also obligated? <b>When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“A man shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), employing the plural form of the verb, this indicates that <b>there are two</b> that are obligated <b>here,</b> both a man and a woman. |
| Leviticus 19:3 | it is stated: “A man shall fear his mother and his father” | Kiddushin 30b:19 | Similarly, <b>it is stated: “A man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), <b>and it is stated: “You shall fear the Lord your God and Him you shall serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). <b>The verse equates the fear of one’s father and mother to the fear of the Omnipresent.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:3 | Therefore, | Kiddushin 31a:1 | <b>she persuades him with</b> many <b>statements</b> of encouragement and does not treat him harshly. <b>Therefore,</b> in the mitzva of: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:11), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded</b> the mention of <b>the honor</b> due one’s <b>father before</b> mentioning the <b>honor</b> due one’s <b>mother.</b> The verse emphasizes the duty that does not come naturally. Similarly, <b>it is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son fears his father more than his mother, because</b> his father <b>teaches him Torah,</b> and consequently he is strict with him. <b>Therefore,</b> in the verse: “A man shall fear his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded</b> the mention of <b>fear of the mother before</b> the mention of <b>fear of the father.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:3 | fear | Kiddushin 34b:12 | <b>And furthermore,</b> one can ask: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>women are obligated in positive mitzvot that are not time bound?</b> The Gemara answers <b>that</b> one <b>derives</b> this <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>fearing</b> one’s mother and father: <b>Just as women are obligated</b> in the mitzva of <b>fear</b> (Leviticus 19:3), <b>so too, women are obligated in every positive mitzva that is not time bound.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:3 | the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father and you shall keep My Shabbatot , | Yevamot 5b:13 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that honoring one’s father and mother overrides Shabbat;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father and you shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:3). The <i>baraita</i> explains the derivation from the verse: <b>All of you,</b> both parent and child, <b>are obligated in My honor,</b> and therefore honoring one’s parents does not override the honor of God, Who commanded the Jewish people to observe Shabbat. |
| Leviticus 19:3 | the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father | Yevamot 6a:10 | <b>And if you say that prohibitions of Shabbat are different</b> in <b>that they are</b> more <b>severe,</b> this cannot be the case, <b>as the <i>tanna</i> speaks generally and he does not raise any difficulty</b> of this kind <b>as it is taught</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that if one’s father said to</b> his son who is a priest or nazirite: <b>Be rendered ritually impure, or if he said to him: Do not return</b> this lost item, it <b>might</b> have been supposed that his son <b>should obey him.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father</b> and you shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:3), which means: <b>All of you are obligated in My honor.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:3 | the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father and you shall keep My Shabbatot , | Yevamot 6a:4 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that if one’s father said to</b> his son, who is a priest or nazirite: <b>Be rendered ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by a corpse, so as to bring me an item from a ritually impure place, <b>or if he said to him: Do not return</b> this lost item, it <b>might</b> have been supposed that his son <b>should obey him.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father and you shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:3). This verse teaches: <b>All of you are obligated in My honor.</b> This proves that the <i>tanna</i> does not differentiate between desecrating Shabbat, which is a severe prohibition, and a priest becoming ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, which is a lighter prohibition. |
| Leviticus 19:4 | image itself, even on a weekday it is prohibited to look at it, because it says: “Do not turn toward idols [ al tifnu el ha’elilim ] | Shabbat 149a:13 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>writing that is under a picture or under graven images [<i>deyokenaot</i>], it is prohibited to read it on Shabbat</b> lest one end up reading business documents. <b>And</b> with regard to an idolatrous <b>image itself, even on a weekday it is prohibited to look at it, because it says: “Do not turn toward idols [<i>al tifnu el ha’elilim</i>]</b> or make yourselves molten gods, I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:4). The Gemara asks for clarification: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> How does this verse indicate that one may not look at an idolatrous image? <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: Do not push God [<i>al tefannu El</i>] out of your mind</b> by looking at these images (<i>Arukh</i>). |
| Leviticus 19:5 | the verse states: “You shall slaughter it to your will” | Chullin 13a:11 | § <b>Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares in</b> the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., he slaughtered without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to him that it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), indicating <b>that the slaughter must be for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., knowing that he is performing an act of slaughter. Shmuel <b>said to</b> him: <b>we</b> received <b>this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already <b>that</b> one must have intent to slaughter the animal <i>ab initio</i>. But <b>from where</b> is it derived that intent to slaughter is <b>indispensable</b> even after the fact? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “You shall slaughter it to your will”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), indicating: <b>Slaughter</b> the animal <b>with your intent,</b> i.e., in the form of a purposeful action. |
| Leviticus 19:5 | due to that which Rav Yosef teaches | Chullin 29a:20 | <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the reference is to <b>sacrificial</b> birds or animals, <b>this is</b> the reason that one may <b>not</b> slaughter two animals simultaneously <b><i>ab initio</i>:</b> It is <b>due to that which Rav Yosef teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And when you sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>] that you may be accepted” (Leviticus 19:5). The term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” can be divided into two terms: You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>] and it [<i>hu</i>]. From the term <b>“You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that there will not be two</b> people <b>slaughtering one offering.</b> From the full term <b>“You shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>]”</b> it is derived <b>that one</b> person <b>may not slaughter two offerings</b> simultaneously. |
| Leviticus 19:5 | except for that, as we learn | Chullin 29b:14 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Are you saying</b> that the discussion concerns a case of <b>two men</b> slaughtering <b>one offering?</b> Raise difficulties <b>except for that, as we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when you sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>] that you may be accepted” (Leviticus 19:5), that the term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” can be divided into two terms: You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>] and it [<i>hu</i>]. From the term <b>“You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that there will not be two</b> people <b>slaughtering one offering.</b> From the full term <b>“You shall offer it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that one</b> person <b>may not slaughter two offerings</b> simultaneously. |
| Leviticus 19:5 | is disqualified. | Chullin 31b:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to slaughter, even Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef</b> concedes that intent is not necessary. He learns this <b>from the fact that the Merciful One revealed</b> that if <b>one acts unawares</b> in performing the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> animals, with no intent to slaughter, the offering <b>is disqualified.</b> This is derived (13a) from the verse: “You shall slaughter it to your will” (Leviticus 19:5). <b>By inference,</b> conclude that with regard to the slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> animals <b>we do not require intent.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:5 | you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted” | Menachot 110a:20 | <b>I did not say to you: Sacrifice</b> offerings to me, <b>so that you will say: I will do His will,</b> i.e., fulfill His needs, <b>and He will do my will. You are not sacrificing to</b> fulfill <b>My will,</b> i.e., My needs, <b>but you are sacrificing to</b> fulfill <b>your will,</b> i.e., your needs, in order to achieve atonement for your sins by observing My mitzvot, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when you sacrifice an offering of peace offerings to the Lord, <b>you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:5). |
| Leviticus 19:5 | you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted [ lirtzonkhem ]” | Menachot 110a:21 | <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse: “And when you sacrifice an offering of peace offerings to the Lord, <b>you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted [<i>lirtzonkhem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), can be interpreted differently: <b>Sacrifice willingly [<i>lirtzonkhem</i>]; sacrifice intentionally.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:5 | “With your will you shall slaughter it” | Menachot 110a:23 | Shmuel <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>We have this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already, that it is a mitzva to slaughter the offering for the sake of a bull, but <b>from where</b> is it derived that this requirement is <b>indispensable?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that the verse states: <b>“With your will you shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), i.e., <b>sacrifice intentionally,</b> in the form of a purposeful action. |
| Leviticus 19:5 | “With your will you shall slaughter it” | Zevachim 47a:2 | Shmuel <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>We have this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already, that it is a mitzva to slaughter the offering for the sake of a bull, but <b>from where</b> is it derived that this requirement is <b>indispensable?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that the verse states: <b>“With your will you shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), i.e., <b>with your</b> full <b>awareness you shall slaughter</b> it, in the form of a purposeful action. |
| Leviticus 19:5 | inside | Zevachim 47a:7 | The Gemara notes: <b>These two</b> Sages, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, although their rulings are stated in the context of entirely different matters, <b>accept</b> as <i>halakha</i> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Now</b> that concerning matters <b>outside</b> the Temple, i.e., non-sacred slaughter and carrying on Shabbat, with regard to which the Torah makes no reference to intention, <b>we say</b> that the intention of one person is effective for the action of another, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to matters <b>inside</b> the Temple, i.e., offerings, with regard to which it is explicitly stated that intention is effective, as indicated by the verse: “With your will you shall slaughter it” (Leviticus 19:5)? |
| Leviticus 19:6 | And it is written with regard to slaughtering: “On the day that you slaughter” | Megillah 20b:15 | <b>For placing hands</b> on the head of an offering <b>and for slaughtering</b> an offering, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And he shall lay</b> his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), comparing the laying of hands to slaughtering. <b>And it is written with regard to slaughtering: “On the day that you slaughter”</b> (Leviticus 19:6), meaning during the day and not at night. <b>And for waving</b> the offerings that require waving, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And on the day you wave the <i>omer</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:12). |
| Leviticus 19:6 | for burning. | Zevachim 56b:3 | § <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> slaughters a peace offer-ing and <b>intends</b> to eat it <b>on the evening</b> preceding the <b>third</b> day, <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> The offering is <b>valid,</b> and it is not disqualified due to his intention to eat it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]. And <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>disqualified.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the offering is <b>valid because</b> on the evening preceding the third day, the peace offering has <b>not</b> yet <b>been removed</b> from its previous status and designated <b>for burning.</b> A peace offering is not burned until the third morning, as the verse states: “It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the following day; and if anything remain until the third day, it shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 19:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> it is <b>disqualified, because it has been rejected from</b> being <b>eaten.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:7 | it shall not be accepted” | Pesachim 16b:8 | <b>And</b> the Sages expounded: <b>Which sin does it bear? If</b> you say it atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat the offering after the permitted time, <b>it is already stated:</b> “And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <i>piggul</i>; <b>it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:7). <b>If</b> you say it atones for <b><i>notar</i>,</b> i.e., meat of an offering left after the time that one was permitted to eat it, <b>it is already stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 19:7 | “iniquity” | Pesachim 73b:13 | The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>From where</b> is this known to be correct? <b>Perhaps</b> it requires uprooting and the disqualification is inherent. And the fact that he requires decay of form <b>is because he agrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabba bar Avuh, who said</b> that <b>even <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by improper intent, which is considered an inherent disqualification, <b>also requires decay of form, for he derived</b> this requirement by way of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18) stated in relation to an offering disqualified by improper intent and the word <b>“iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 19:7) stated <b>with regard to leftover</b> sacrificial meat. |
| Leviticus 19:7 | it shall not be accepted” | Yoma 7a:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection.</b> It is stated: <b>“And Aaron will gain forgiveness for the sin committed in the sacred things</b> that the children of Israel shall hallow in all their sacred gifts, and it shall be always upon his forehead that they may be accepted favorably before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). <b>And for which sin does</b> the frontplate <b>gain forgiveness? If</b> it is for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat it after the permitted time, <b>it has already been stated:</b> “And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <i>piggul</i>; <b>it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:7). There is no acceptance of an offering that became <i>piggul</i>. <b>And if it is</b> for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> meat of an offering left after the permitted time for eating it passed, <b>it has already been stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 19:7 | third | Zevachim 28a:19 | <b>Rather, Abaye said: When Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi came,</b> he said that <b>Rav says:</b> Shmuel was actually referring to two separate verses. And he <b>relied on that which the <i>tanna</i> taught:</b> The verse is seemingly redundant <b>when it states:</b> “And if it be eaten at all on the <b>third</b> day, it is <i>piggul</i>; it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 19:7), <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 19:2), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated: “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day</b>…it shall be <i>piggul</i>” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Leviticus 19:7 | third | Zevachim 28b:7 | The Gemara returns to the initial assumption that the statement of Shmuel is referring to two verses: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to conclude <b>that the long verse</b> (Leviticus 7:18) is referring <b>to</b> intent to consume the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and</b> that the verse that mentions the <b>third</b> day (Leviticus 19:7) <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy,”</b> is referring to intent to consume it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area? I</b> might just as well <b>reverse</b> the two. |
| Leviticus 19:7 | third | Zevachim 29a:5 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: According to your</b> opinion, in <b>what</b> way do <b>you interpret</b> the reference to the <b>third</b> day (Leviticus 19:7) <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy”?</b> Rava responded: <b>That</b> verse is <b>necessary to</b> teach <b>that</b> a given <b>location</b> is considered to be outside the offering’s designated area only if it <b>is</b> so <b>in three ways,</b> i.e., outside the permitted limits <b>of</b> the <b>blood, of</b> the <b>meat, and of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:7 | on the third day, | Zevachim 82a:22 | The Gemara explains that one does not derive this <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as the verse <b>states:</b> “And if it be eaten at all <b>on the third day,</b> it is <i>piggul</i>; it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 19:7), and the Sages expounded this verse with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of intent while slaughtering an offering. |
| Leviticus 19:8 | “But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity” | Keritot 5a:11 | The Gemara explains that this is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Zavda bar Levi teaches: It is stated there,</b> with regard to meat of an offering left over after the appointed time for its consumption [<i>notar</i>]: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is stated here,</b> with regard to intent to consume an offering after its appointed time: <b>“And the soul that eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). <b>Just as there</b> the punishment for eating <i>notar</i> is <b><i>karet</i>, so too here,</b> the punishment for eating <i>piggul</i> is <b><i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:8 | “But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred thing of the Lord” | Keritot 5a:13 | <b>What is</b> this verbal analogy? One <b>derives</b> by verbal analogy of the word <b>“sacred”</b> in Leviticus and the word <b>“sacred”</b> in Exodus that the verse: “But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity,” is discussing <i>notar</i>. This verse states: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred thing of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is written: “You shall burn the leftovers [<i>notar</i>] in fire;</b> they are not to be eaten, <b>for</b> they are <b>sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:34). Just as the verse in Exodus is referring to <i>notar</i>, the same is true of the verse in Leviticus. |
| Leviticus 19:8 | And it is written with regard to notar : “But every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord” | Temurah 3a:6 | <b>And one derives</b> the exemption from <b><i>notar</i></b> by drawing a verbal analogy <b>between</b> the word <b>“profane”</b> used in the context of <i>notar</i> and the word <b>“profane”</b> used in the context of <b>ritual impurity. As it is written</b> in the verse cited above <b>with regard to ritual impurity:</b> “That they separate themselves from the holy items of <b>the children of Israel,</b> which they hallow unto Me, <b>and that they profane not</b> My holy name.” <b>And it is written with regard to <i>notar</i>: “But every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8). Since the prohibition against consuming consecrated items while impure does not apply to the offerings of gentiles, neither does the prohibition of <i>notar</i>. |
| Leviticus 19:8 | and it is written with regard to notar : “But everyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord” | Temurah 3a:7 | <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the gentiles’ exemption from <b><i>piggul</i></b> by verbal analogy <b>between</b> the word <b>“iniquity”</b> used in the context of <i>piggul</i> and the word <b>“iniquity”</b> used in the context of <b><i>notar</i>, as it is written with regard to <i>piggul</i>: “And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), <b>and it is written with regard to <i>notar</i>: “But everyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8). <b>And</b> based on these two verbal analogies, one concludes that with regard to <b>all of them,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and ritually impure offerings, the prohibition against consumption applies only to offerings of <b>the children of Israel, but not</b> to those of <b>gentiles.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:8 | “But whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity” | Zevachim 28b:1 | Therefore, <b>if</b> the verse <b>is not</b> referring <b>to the matter</b> of intent to consume the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, apply it to the matter of</b> intent to consume it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area. And</b> as for the punishment of <i>karet</i>, <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> it to the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i>,</b> i.e., actually partaking of the offering beyond its designated time, as the verse states: <b>“But whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 19:8). This indicates that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of <i>notar</i>, <b>to the exclusion of</b> intent to consume the offering <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:8 | shall be cut off | Zevachim 28b:5 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Zavdi bar Levi taught: It is derived</b> that the prohibition of <i>notar</i> carries the penalty of <i>karet</i> by way of verbal analogy between <b>“sacred”</b> and <b>“sacred.” It is written here:</b> “But whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity, because <b>he has profaned the sacred item of the Lord; and</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 19:8). <b>And it is written there:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain until the morning, <b>then you shall burn the remainder [<i>notar</i>] with fire;</b> it shall not be eaten, because it is sacred” (Exodus 29:34). <b>Just as</b> the verse <b>there</b> is referring to <b><i>notar</i>, so too,</b> there verse <b>here</b> is referring to <b><i>notar</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:8 | “iniquity” from notar | Zevachim 29a:4 | Finally, when the verse states: <b>“And the soul that eats of it</b> shall bear his iniquity,” the term “of it” indicates that only <b>one</b> of the above disqualifications carries the penalty of <i>karet</i>, <b>but not two</b> of them. <b>And which is this?</b> It is intent to consume the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, as</b> one <b>derives</b> by way of verbal analogy between <b>“iniquity”</b> and <b>“iniquity” from <i>notar</i></b> (Leviticus 19:8), that “bear his iniquity” means that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. The comparison is apt <b>since</b> <i>notar</i> <b>is similar to</b> intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time <b>in</b> that both prohibitions share the features mentioned above that form the acronym: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>beit</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:8 | ritual impurity. | Zevachim 45a:9 | <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>notar</i></b> itself is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between <b>profanation</b> stated with regard to <i>notar</i> and <b>profanation</b> stated with regard to <b>ritual impurity.</b> With regard to <i>notar</i> the verse states: “Because he has profaned the sacred item of the Lord” (Leviticus 19:8), and with regard to impurity the verse states: “And that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2). <b>And with regard to impurity it is written</b> in that same verse: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of <b>the children of Israel,”</b> which indicates: <b>But not</b> the sacred items of <b>gentiles.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:8 | ritual impurity. | Zevachim 45b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> proof that the prohibition against eating consecrated food in a state of <b>ritual impurity</b> applies even to an item that does not have a permitting factor. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>notar</i></b> likewise applies to an item that does not have a permitting factor? The Gemara answers: This is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between <b>profanation</b> stated in the context of <i>notar</i> and <b>profanation</b> stated in the context of <b>ritual impurity.</b> With regard to <i>notar</i> the verse states: “Because he has profaned the sacred item of the Lord” (Leviticus 19:8), and with regard to impurity the verse states: “And that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2). |
| Leviticus 19:9 | the Merciful One writes: “And when you reap [ uvekutzrekhem ] the harvest of your land, | Chullin 135b:12 | Likewise, with regard to <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> produce in the corner of the field that is left for the poor, Rabbi Ilai concedes that the joint owners of produce are obligated, <b>even though it is written</b> in the verse cited below: <b>“Your field [<i>sadekha</i>],”</b> using a singular pronoun, from which it can be inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> field, <b>yes,</b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to that <b>which is</b> owned <b>in partnership,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated. The reason is that <b>the Merciful One writes: “And when you reap [<i>uvekutzrekhem</i>] the harvest of your land,</b> you shall not entirely reap the corner of your field” (Leviticus 19:9). The term “when you reap” uses the plural pronoun, which indicates that even partners of land are obligated in <i>pe’a</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“your field”</b> in the singular? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> land owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile</b> from the obligation of <i>pe’a</i>. |
| Leviticus 19:9 | The verse states: | Chullin 137a:15 | <b>The verse states:</b> “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely remove the corner of your field by reaping, and you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest” (Leviticus 19:9). The superfluous term <b>“by reaping”</b> includes uprooting the crop. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the obligation extends to one who <b>picked</b> the crop by hand? <b>The verse states: “When you reap”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), which is also superfluous. It is derived from here that the mitzva applies to all ways of gathering the crop, provided they are the usual manner of harvesting that particular crop. |
| Leviticus 19:9 | is written: “And when you reap the harvest of your land” | Chullin 138a:18 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>so too,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the seller gives the first sheared wool applies only <b>if</b> the seller <b>began to shear</b> the sheep before he sold them, that explanation is difficult. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to <i>pe’a</i>, it <b>is written: “And when you reap the harvest of your land”</b> (Leviticus 19:9), which indicates that <b>from the time that he began to harvest he is obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>pe’a</i> <b>with regard to the entire field. But here,</b> in the case of the first sheared wool, <b>he is not obligated with regard to the entire flock from the time that he began to shear</b> his sheep. Therefore, even if he began shearing before he sold the sheep, the obligation to give the first sheared wool should not apply to the seller. |
| Leviticus 19:9 | you shall not wholly reap | Chullin 141b:2 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> by <b>Rabbi Oshaya and Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> It is written with regard to forgotten sheaves left for the poor: “When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, <b>you shall not return</b> to fetch it” (Deuteronomy 24:19). If one transgressed this prohibition <b>and</b> one <b>returned</b> to fetch it, he is liable to receive lashes. Likewise, it is written with regard to produce in the corner of the field [<i>pe’a</i>], which is given to the poor: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, <b>you shall not wholly reap</b> the corner of your field” (Leviticus 19:9). If one transgressed this prohibition <b>and reaped</b> the corner of his field, such individuals <b>are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:9 | the corner of your field” | Nedarim 6b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and it is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one wants to render his entire field <i>pe’a</i>,</b> he may <b>do</b> so? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall not wholly reap <b>the corner of your field”</b> (Leviticus 19:9). This is expounded to mean that the entirety of “your field” may be designated as the “corner” that is left for the poor. |
| Leviticus 19:10 | and the pe’a , as it is written: “And you shall not glean [ te’olel ] your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit [ peret ] of your vineyard; | Chullin 131a:14 | Before Rav Idi bar Avin explains his objection, the Gemara cites the sources for the <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>four gifts</b> are left to the poor from the produce <b>of a vineyard: The <i>peret</i>, and the <i>olelot</i>, and the forgotten</b> clusters, <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>, as it is written: “And you shall not glean [<i>te’olel</i>] your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit [<i>peret</i>] of your vineyard;</b> you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:10). |
| Leviticus 19:10 | say to you: It is different there, as the verse states: “You shall leave | Temurah 6a:11 | The Gemara explains that <b>Abaye</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states: “You shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:10), and subsequently, it again states: <b>“You shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). The <b>superfluous</b> phrase teaches that the owner must give <i>pe’a</i> in any event, even if he harvests the grain and kneads it into dough. But in general, transgressions are effective. |
| Leviticus 19:11 | The verse states: “Neither shall you deal falsely” | Bava Kamma105b:19 | § The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> concerning a bailee who denies having a deposit in his possession. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> A bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>denies</b> a claim <b>concerning a deposit becomes</b> as <b>a robber with regard to it, and</b> he is therefore <b>liable</b> to pay even <b>for</b> damage that is the result of <b>accidents.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> also <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And deals falsely with it”</b> (Leviticus 5:22–24), and <b>we learned</b> from this verse the <b>punishment</b> for one who denies having a deposit. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> itself derived? <b>The verse states: “Neither shall you deal falsely”</b> (Leviticus 19:11). The Gemara explains: <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment of</b> having to pay <b>money</b> due to his denial even for accidental damage, in accordance with the statement of Rav Sheshet? |
| Leviticus 19:11 | The verse states: “Nor lie” | Bava Kamma105b:20 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment</b> for taking a false <b>oath,</b> i.e., the additional one-fifth payment and the bringing of the offering. The Gemara challenges: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a case <b>where he took an oath, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> teaches a case <b>where he did not take an oath,</b> and the punishment referred to by the <i>baraita</i> is the imposition of liability for accidental damage. <b>As the latter clause teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“And swear to a lie”</b> (Leviticus 5:22), and <b>we learned</b> from this that there is <b>a punishment</b> for taking a false oath. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> itself derived? <b>The verse states: “Nor lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11). <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> teaches the <i>halakha</i> <b>where he took an oath, the first clause</b> must be teaching the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where he did not take an oath.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:11 | “You shall not steal” | Bava Metzia61b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the prohibition: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), <b>that the Merciful One wrote?</b> This is yet another prohibition against taking money by illegitimate means, and it could be derived from the other prohibitions mentioned previously. The Gemara answers that it is necessary for the Merciful One to write that prohibition <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> applies in all circumstances, even if you do so only <b>in order to aggravate</b> the victim; <b>“you shall not steal”</b> applies in all circumstances, even if you do so <b>in order to pay the double payment</b> as a gift to the person from whom you stole. |
| Leviticus 19:11 | lashes | Chullin 141a:19 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught: <b>A thief and a robber are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. A thief violates the prohibition of: “You shall not steal” (Leviticus 19:11), and a robber violates the prohibition of: “You shall not rob” (Leviticus 19:13); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>But here,</b> the prohibition against robbing <b>is a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva, as the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and: <b>“And he shall restore the robbed item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). And nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda deems one liable to receive lashes for transgressing the prohibition against robbing. Therefore, <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:11 | “You shall not steal” | Sanhedrin 86a:17 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), and it is <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>steals property</b> that <b>the verse is speaking. Do you say</b> that the verse is speaking <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>steals property, or</b> perhaps the verse is speaking <b>only with regard to</b> one who <b>abducts people? You say: Go out and learn from</b> one of <b>the thirteen hermeneutical principles: A matter derived from its context. With regard to what</b> context <b>is the</b> subsequent <b>verse:</b> “You shall neither exploit your neighbor nor rob him” (Leviticus 19:13), <b>speaking?</b> It is speaking <b>with regard to property. So too here,</b> the verse is speaking <b>with regard to property.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:11 | : “You shall not lie” | Shevuot 26a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yishmael understands that liability is extended to one whose oath <b>is similar to an oath “to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>He whose prohibition is due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3), is liable, as liability for an oath about the future entails breaking one’s word. <b>Excluded is that</b> oath <b>whose prohibition is not due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the verse<b>: “You shall not lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), since liability for an oath about the past applies when the oath itself was a lie. |
| Leviticus 19:12 | And it is written with regard to a false oath: “And you shall not swear by My name falsely, so that you desecrate [ veḥillalta ] the name of your God: | Shabbat 33a:3 | <b>Due to the sin of an oath</b> taken <b>in vain and a false oath, and desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, and desecration of Shabbat, wild beasts abound</b> in the world, <b>and</b> domesticated <b>animals cease</b> to exist, <b>and human beings decrease</b> in number, <b>and the roads become desolate, as it is stated: “And if in spite of these [<i>be</i>’<i>eleh</i>] things you will not be corrected unto Me,</b> but will walk contrary unto Me casually” (Leviticus 26:23). <b>Do not read of these [<i>be</i>’<i>eleh</i>]; rather,</b> due to a vain <b>oath [<i>be</i>’<i>ala</i>]. And it is written</b> that the punishment for this is: <b>“And I will send the beast of the field among you,</b> which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate” (Leviticus 26:22). <b>And it is written with regard to a false oath: “And you shall not swear by My name falsely, so that you desecrate [<i>veḥillalta</i>] the name of your God:</b> I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). <b>And it is written with regard to desecrating the name of God: “And you shall not desecrate [<i>teḥallelu</i>] My Holy Name”</b> (Leviticus 22:32). <b>And it is written with regard to desecrating Shabbat: “Every one that desecrates it [<i>meḥaleleha</i>] shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14). <b>And derive</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] <b>desecration [<i>ḥillul</i>] of Shabbat from desecration [<i>ḥillul</i>] of a false oath.</b> Just as punishment for a false oath is desolation and wild beasts, one receives the same punishment for desecrating Shabbat and the name of God. |
| Leviticus 19:12 | you shall not take an oath by My name falsely, | Shevuot 20b:6 | § <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> relating to the future, and does not fulfill it, it is <b>a false</b> oath. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> relating to past actions, and it is a lie, it is an oath taken <b>in vain, and its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain;</b> for the Lord will not absolve of guilt he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). |
| Leviticus 19:12 | you shall not take an oath by My name falsely, | Shevuot 21a:4 | § <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate,</b> or: <b>I did not eat,</b> it is <b>a false</b> oath if it is not true. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> and breaks his oath, he <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to bind his soul with a bond, <b>he shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). <b>And which</b> oath is <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b> It is when one <b>takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true. |
| Leviticus 19:13 | shall not abide with you all night | Bava Kamma99a:5 | The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gave his garment to a craftsman,</b> and the craftsman <b>concluded</b> the work <b>and notified</b> the owner that the work was complete, <b>even</b> if the owner delays paying the craftsman <b>from now until ten days</b> henceforth, <b>he does not violate, for this</b> delay, the prohibition <b>of:</b> “You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him; the wages of a hired worker <b>shall not abide with you all night</b> until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13). If the craftsman <b>gave</b> the garment <b>to him at midday,</b> then <b>once the sun has set</b> and the owner has not paid him, the owner <b>does violate, for this</b> delay, the prohibition <b>against delaying</b> the payment of wages. |
| Leviticus 19:13 | all night? The verse states: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning” | Bava Metzia110b:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning a day laborer that</b> he <b>collects</b> his wages <b>all night? The verse states: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 19:13). This indicates that he must pay him by the morning, and he has therefore not transgressed the prohibition of delaying the payment of wages until that time. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>concerning a night laborer that</b> he <b>collects</b> his wages <b>all day? As it is stated: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). |
| Leviticus 19:13 | of: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning” | Bava Metzia111a:17 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Whether</b> referring to <b>a person’s wages</b> that he receives <b>or the renting of an animal or the renting of utensils,</b> are all <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 19:13). <b>When</b> does he transgress these prohibitions? He transgresses them <b>when</b> the one owed the money <b>claimed</b> the payment from <b>him.</b> If he <b>did not claim</b> his payment from <b>him</b> the other <b>does not transgress</b> the prohibitions. <b>If</b> the one who owes the money <b>transferred his</b> payment by leaving instructions <b>with a storekeeper or with a money changer</b> to pay him, <b>he does not transgress</b> the prohibitions. |
| Leviticus 19:13 | of: “Do not oppress your neighbor” | Bava Metzia111a:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Anyone who withholds the wages of a hired laborer violates these five</b> negative <b>prohibitions and</b> one <b>positive mitzva.</b> He <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not oppress your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition of: “You should not oppress a hired laborer who is poor”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14), <b>and the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> he has not fulfilled the positive mitzva <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> he has violated the prohibition <b>of: “The sun shall not set upon him”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). |
| Leviticus 19:13 | “hired laborer,” and there it is different, as the verse states: “The wages of [ pe’ulat ] a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning” | Bava Metzia111b:12 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> he does <b>not derive</b> the analogy of: <b>“Hired laborer”</b> and <b>“hired laborer,” and there it is different, as the verse states: “The wages of [<i>pe’ulat</i>] a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 19:13). This verse is referring to <b>any</b> case <b>where its work [<i>pe’ulato</i>] is with you,</b> which includes animals and vessels. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even a <i>ger toshav</i></b> should be included, as he too performs work for you. The Gemara responds: The initial section of <b>the verse states: “Your neighbor,”</b> which refers to <b>your neighbor</b> who is Jewish, <b>and not a <i>ger toshav</i>,</b> who is not called a neighbor. |
| Leviticus 19:13 | hired laborer | Bava Metzia111b:3 | <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Whether</b> referring to <b>the hire of a person or the rental of an animal or the rental of utensils,</b> all are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and they are</b> likewise <b>subject to the prohibition of delaying</b> the payment of wages of a <b>hired laborer</b> (Leviticus 19:13). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> One who hires <b>a <i>ger toshav</i> is subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages,” but is not subject to the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages, and the payment of rent of <b>an animal or vessels is included only in</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not oppress” alone.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:13 | “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain | Bava Metzia112a:5 | § The mishna teaches: <b>When</b> does he transgress these prohibitions? He transgresses them <b>when</b> the one owed the money <b>claimed</b> the payment from <b>him.</b> If he <b>did not claim</b> his payment from <b>him,</b> the other <b>does not transgress</b> the prohibitions. <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to the verse: <b>“The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain</b> with you all night until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13), one <b>might</b> have thought that he should be liable <b>even</b> if the laborer <b>did not claim</b> his wages from <b>him. The verse states “with you,”</b> meaning the prohibition is not transgressed unless it is <b>with your knowledge</b> and consent that you have not paid him. But if he did not even request his wages yet, the prohibition has not been violated. |
| Leviticus 19:13 | “You shall not…rob” | Bava Metzia26b:5 | § <b>And Rava says:</b> In a case where <b>one saw a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that fell</b> from another, if <b>he took</b> the coin <b>in order to steal it, before</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>he violates all of</b> the following mitzvot: He is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not…rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13); <b>and due to</b> the positive mitzva, stated with regard to found items, of: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and due to</b> the prohibition, stated with regard to one who finds an item: <b>“You may not disregard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>And even if he returned it after</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, it is merely <b>a gift that he gave him; and the transgression that he performed, he performed,</b> and he remains in violation of these mitzvot. |
| Leviticus 19:13 | the matter of a hired | Bava Metzia61b:1 | <b>and</b> this prohibition <b>is written in</b> the context of <b>the matter of a hired</b> laborer: “You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him, and the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with you all night until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13). |
| Leviticus 19:13 | of a positive mitzva, as the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob” | Chullin 141a:19 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught: <b>A thief and a robber are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. A thief violates the prohibition of: “You shall not steal” (Leviticus 19:11), and a robber violates the prohibition of: “You shall not rob” (Leviticus 19:13); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>But here,</b> the prohibition against robbing <b>is a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva, as the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and: <b>“And he shall restore the robbed item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23).

| Leviticus 19:13 | robbery, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob” | Makkot 16a:16 | The Gemara questions Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more</b> prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva for which one is flogged? <b>But aren’t there others?</b> Before stating its challenges, the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases that it will cite: <b>Robbery, collateral, and <i>pe’a</i>.</b> The Gemara elaborates: Isn’t there the case of <b>robbery, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and also states: <b>“And he shall return the stolen item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23)? Isn’t there the case of <b>collateral, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not come into his house to fetch his pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), and He then states: <b>“You shall return to him the pledge when the sun sets”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13)? |
| Leviticus 19:13 | verse: | Sanhedrin 86a:17 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), and it is <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>steals property</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.

So too here,</b> the verse is speaking <b>with regard to property.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:13 | you shall not rob | Temurah 6a:3 | The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>robbery,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “You shall not oppress you neighbor, and <b>you shall not rob</b> him” (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 93b): <b>One who robs</b> another of <b>wood and fashions it</b> into <b>vessels,</b> or one who robs another of <b>wool and fashions it</b> into <b>garments, pays</b> the victim <b>according to</b> the value of the goods at <b>the time of the robbery,</b> but he need not return the vessels or garments, since by changing the stolen items he acquired them. If he can acquire the stolen item, this is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:14 | before | Avodah Zarah14a:5 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let us be concerned lest</b> the buyer <b>go and sell</b> these items <b>to another</b> gentile, <b>and they sacrifice</b> them. <b>Abaye said</b> in response: This scenario is certainly possible, but <b>we are commanded</b> only not <b>to</b> “place a stumbling block <b>before</b> the blind” (Leviticus 19:14), i.e., one may not be the direct cause of a gentile’s idol worship. <b>We are not commanded</b> not <b>to</b> place a stumbling block <b>before</b> one who may subsequently place it <b>before</b> the blind. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | One may not keep an animal in the inns [ befundekaot ] of gentiles because they are suspected of bestiality. | Avodah Zarah22a:11 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not keep an animal in the inns [<i>befundekaot</i>] of gentiles because they are suspected of bestiality.</b> Since even gentiles are prohibited from engaging in bestiality, a Jew who places his animal there is guilty of violating the prohibition: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” (Leviticus 19:14). <b>And a woman may not seclude herself with</b> gentiles <b>because they are suspected of</b> engaging in <b>forbidden sexual relations. And</b> any <b>person may not seclude himself with</b> gentiles <b>because they are suspected of bloodshed.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Avodah Zarah22a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, why</b> does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar state <b>specifically</b> that the reason for the prohibition is <b>because</b> the field <b>is called by the name of</b> the owner? <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>due to</b> the fact that the Samaritan, like a Jew, is commanded to refrain from labor during the intermediate days of the Festival, and since he will work on these days, renting him a field is included in the prohibition: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another: One</b> reason is <b>that</b> of the prohibition: You shall not put a stumbling block <b>before the blind; and, furthermore,</b> it is prohibited <b>because</b> the field <b>is called by the name of</b> the owner. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Avodah Zarah6a:14 | § <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the reason for the prohibition against conducting business with gentiles in the days preceding their festivals <b>because</b> the gentile might <b>profit,</b> which will bring him joy, and he will subsequently give thanks to his idol on his festival? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is because this is a violation of the prohibition: <b>“And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as one who sells an animal to a gentile thereby aids him in engaging in prohibited idol worship. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | from a living animal to descendants of Noah? The verse states: “And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Avodah Zarah6b:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a person may not extend a cup of wine to a nazirite,</b> who is prohibited from drinking wine, <b>and</b> that he may not extend <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from a living animal to descendants of Noah? The verse states: “And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). <b>But here,</b> in both cases, <b>if one does not give it to him, he can take it himself, and</b> yet the one who provides it to him <b>transgresses due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind.”</b> |
| Leviticus 19:14 | animals to a shepherd? Isn’t it written: “Do not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Bava Metzia5b:3 | The Gemara rejects this: This is <b>not difficult. That</b> case, where he is presumed a robber, is a case where he herds <b>his</b> own animals, and <b>this</b> case, where he is not presumed a robber, is a case where he herds animals that <b>belong to others. As if you do not say so,</b> if even one who herds the animals of others is presumably a robber, <b>how do we give</b> our <b>animals to a shepherd? Isn’t it written: “Do not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14)? It is prohibited to cause others to commit a transgression. <b>Rather, there is a presumption</b> that <b>a person sins only for his own</b> benefit, and one would not commit robbery for the benefit of animals that are not his. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind” | Bava Metzia75b:10 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Whoever has money and lends it not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses violates</b> the prohibition of: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as this tempts the borrower not to repay his debt. <b>And Reish Lakish says: He brings a curse upon himself, as it is stated: “Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak arrogantly against the righteous,</b> with pride and contempt” (Psalms 31:19), as when the lender comes to claim his money without any proof, people will think he is falsely accusing the borrower, and they will end up cursing him. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | and of: “And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind, and you shall fear your God; I am the Lord” | Bava Metzia75b:4 | <b>And these</b> people <b>violate a prohibition</b> of interest: <b>The lender, and the borrower, and the guarantor, and the witnesses. And the Rabbis say: Also the scribe</b> who writes the promissory note violates this prohibition. These parties to the transaction <b>violate</b> different prohibtions. Some are in violation of: <b>“You shall not give</b> him your money with interest” (Leviticus 25:37), <b>and of: “Do not take from him</b> interest or increase” (Leviticus 25:36), <b>and of: “Do not be to him as a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24), <b>and of “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24), <b>and of: “And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind, and you shall fear your God; I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind” | Bava Metzia75b:6 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And these</b> people <b>violate</b> the prohibition of interest. <b>Abaye says:</b> The <b>lender violates all of them,</b> meaning all of the prohibitions listed in the mishna. The <b>borrower violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “You shall not lend to your brother with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:20), as he enables his brother to lend with interest. And they also violate the prohibition: “You may lend to a gentile with interest, but <b>to your brother you shall not lend with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:21), as well as: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). The <b>guarantor and the witness violate only: “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24). |
| Leviticus 19:14 | of: “Nor put a stumbling block before the blind” | Bava Metzia90b:2 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This provides no conclusive proof, as <b>the inhabitants of the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, who are the ones who raised this question, <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥideka, who says: The descendants of Noah are commanded with regard to castration.</b> They too are prohibited from performing this practice. <b>And</b> consequently, those Jews who cause them to do it <b>transgress</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Nor put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “Nor place a stumbling block before the blind” | Chullin 7b:8 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> the comment of Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir and <b>emerged to greet him. He said to him: I will sell</b> the mules. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to him:</b> You will thereby violate the prohibition: <b>“Nor place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as it is prohibited for any Jew to keep a destructive animal in his possession. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “Nor put a stumbling block before the blind” | Kiddushin 32a:7 | <b>And this is as</b> reflected in an incident involving <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna, when Rav Huna tore silk garments in front of his son Rabba.</b> Rav Huna had <b>said</b> to himself: <b>I will go</b> and <b>see if he becomes angry or does not become angry,</b> i.e., he wanted to test him and see whether his son Rabba would honor him. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> his son <b>would become angry</b> and Rav Huna would thereby <b>violate</b> the prohibition of: <b>“Nor put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as by testing his son Rav Huna would have caused him to sin. The Gemara answers: It was a case <b>where</b> the father had <b>forgone his honor</b> from the outset. Consequently, even if the son grew angry with him, he would not have violated the mitzva. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind” | Moed Katan17a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the story mentioned by Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani involving <b>the maidservant in the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? It was related <b>that the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saw a certain man who was striking his adult son. She said: Let that man be excommunicated, due to</b> the fact that <b>he has transgressed</b> the injunction: <b>“You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind,”</b> and <b>the verse speaks</b> here <b>of one who strikes his adult son,</b> as the son is likely to become angry and strike his father back, thereby transgressing the severe prohibition against hitting one’s parent. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Moed Katan5a:19 | <b>Abaye said:</b> An allusion to the marking of graves may be learned <b>from here,</b> as it is written: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). <b>Rav Pappa said</b> the obligation is alluded to in the verse: <b>“And He will say: Pave, pave, clear the way,</b> take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people” (Isaiah 57:14), which indicates that roads must be cleared of all obstacles and hazards. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Nedarim 62b:4 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi had a particular forest,</b> and <b>he sold it</b> for its wood <b>to the temple of fire</b> worship. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Isn’t there</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), which prohibits assisting others in committing transgressions? And yet you are providing assistance to an idolatrous cult. <b>He said to him: Most</b> of the <b>wood</b> they use <b>is for kindling,</b> not for their ritual service. Consequently, I need not be concerned that the particular wood that I have sold them will be used for idolatry. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | “And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Niddah 57a:3 | The mishna teaches that Samaritans <b>are deemed credible to state: We buried</b> the stillborn children in a certain place, or to state that they did not bury the stillborn children there, and that place does not transmit ritual impurity. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the Samaritans <b>do not accept</b> the Sages’ interpretation of the verse: <b>“And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), that one may not cause another to sin. Since they are not concerned about misleading others, why is their testimony accepted? <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> a Samaritan <b>priest is standing there,</b> on that spot, which indicates that he genuinely maintains it is not impure with the impurity of a corpse. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | The verse states: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” | Pesachim 22b:2 | The Gemara further challenges Rabbi Abbahu’s opinion: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition against eating <b>a limb</b> cut <b>from a living</b> animal, <b>as it is written:</b> “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; <b>and you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a person</b> may <b>not offer a cup of wine to a nazirite,</b> who is prohibited from drinking wine, and that he may not offer <b>a limb</b> cut <b>from a living animal to a descendant of Noah,</b> who is prohibited by Noahide law from eating a limb from a living animal? <b>The verse states: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). Causing another person to sin is like placing a stumbling block before a blind person; one who does so violates this prohibition. The prohibition of giving a limb from a living animal to a gentile is apparently due only to the prohibition of placing a stumbling block. <b>However, it is permitted</b> for one to throw it <b>to dogs.</b> Therefore, despite the fact that the verse says: “You shall not eat it,” apparently there is no prohibition against benefiting from this prohibited item. This challenges Rabbi Abbahu’s principle. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | The verse states: “You shall not curse the deaf, | Sanhedrin 66a:17 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Consequently, a third case is necessary to arrive at the required paradigm. <b>The verse states: “You shall not curse the deaf,</b> nor put a stumbling block before the blind” (Leviticus 19:14). <b>The verse speaks of the wretched of your people.</b> From the fact that it is prohibited to curse even those people, it can be derived that it is prohibited to curse anyone. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | as it is written: “Do not curse the deaf” | Shevuot 36a:20 | The Gemara proceeds to cite sources for these prohibitions. The prohibition against cursing <b>oneself</b> is derived <b>as it is written: “Only observe for yourself, and keep your soul diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9). This is <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rabbi Avin says that Rabbi Ile’a says: Everywhere</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> the terms <b>observe, lest, or do not are stated, it is nothing other than a prohibition.</b> One who curses himself does not keep, i.e., take care of, himself and consequently violates the prohibition. <b>And</b> cursing <b>another</b> is derived <b>as it is written: “Do not curse the deaf”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), which applies to others just as it does to one who is deaf. |
| Leviticus 19:14 | as it is written: “You shall not curse the deaf” | Temurah 4a:1 | The Gemara responds: <b>You cannot say</b> that Deuteronomy 28:59 is referring to one who pronounces the name of Heaven in vain, <b>as it is written: “You shall not curse the deaf”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), which prohibits all curses, even those using God’s name. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Deuteronomy 28:59 is referring <b>to cursing another,</b> one can say that the separate <b>warning</b> of punishment <b>for this</b> prohibition is <b>from here, as it is written: “You shall not curse the deaf.”</b> One verse articulates the prohibition, and the other indicates liability for punishment. <b>But if you say</b> that Deuteronomy 28:59 is referring to <b>pronouncing the name of Heaven in vain, from where is the warning of</b> this prohibition? A prohibition requires two verses to include liability for punishment. |
| Leviticus 19:15 | “In justice shall you judge your neighbor” | Sanhedrin 32b:4 | This distinction is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: It <b>is written</b> in one verse: <b>“In justice shall you judge your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> in another verse: <b>“Justice, justice, shall you follow”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:20), with the repetition indicating that it is not enough to merely judge with justice. He continues: <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>Here,</b> this latter verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> a possibly <b>fraudulent trial,</b> where the court must take extra care to judge with justice; and <b>there,</b> that former verse is stated <b>with regard to a trial that</b> does <b>not</b> appear <b>fraudulent.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:15 | as it is stated: “In righteousness shall you judge your neighbor” | Sanhedrin 3a:5 | <b>Rather, Rava said: Two</b> matters <b>are</b> in fact <b>taught</b> in the mishna, <b>because</b> of the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> that the Sages instituted leniencies with regard to cases of monetary law so as not to lock the door in the face of potential borrowers. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: By Torah law,</b> the adjudication of <b>one</b> judge is <b>also valid</b> in cases of admissions and loans, <b>as it is stated: “In righteousness shall you judge your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), in the singular. <b>But</b> by rabbinic law, three judges are required, <b>due to</b> the concern that a single judge may be one of <b>those who sit</b> idly on street <b>corners,</b> i.e., unlearned people who are not involved in business and are unlikely to judge the case correctly. |
| Leviticus 19:15 | “But in righteousness shall you judge your colleague” | Shevuot 30a:12 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“But in righteousness shall you judge your colleague”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), from which it is derived: The court must ensure <b>that there will not be</b> a situation where <b>one</b> litigant <b>is sitting and one</b> litigant <b>is standing,</b> or a situation where <b>one</b> litigant <b>says everything</b> that <b>he needs</b> to say to present his case <b>and one</b> litigant, the judge <b>says to him: Curtail your statement. Alternatively,</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“But in righteousness shall you judge your colleague,”</b> that you <b>should judge another favorably,</b> and seek to find justification for his actions, even if when interpreted differently his actions could be judged unfavorably. |
| Leviticus 19:16 | “You shall not go up and down as talebearer” | Ketubot 46a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <b>warning,</b> i.e., the prohibition that serves as the source for the flogging <b>for a defamer? Rabbi Elazar says</b> that the prohibition is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>“You shall not go up and down as talebearer”</b> (Leviticus 19:16). <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> that it is derived <b>from: “Then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing [<i>davar ra</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10), which is expounded to mean <i>dibbur ra</i>, evil speech. |
| Leviticus 19:16 | Or perhaps she can say to him: By Torah law you are required to rescue me, | Kiddushin 8b:13 | The Gemara presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one say that <b>she commits herself</b> to betrothal <b>and transfers herself</b> to him <b>through this benefit that</b> she receives <b>by being rescued</b> from the dog? <b>Or perhaps she can say to him: By Torah law you are required to rescue me,</b> due to the injunction: “Neither shall you stand idly by the blood of your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:16), and therefore she is not betrothed with the loaf because she does not owe him anything. This problem is also left unanswered, and the Gemara again states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 19:16 | About this it is stated: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people” | Sanhedrin 29a:18 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves</b> the courtroom <b>he may not say: I deemed</b> you <b>exempt and my colleagues deemed</b> you <b>liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me</b> and consequently you were deemed liable? <b>About this it is stated: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people”</b> (Leviticus 19:16), <b>and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets,</b> but one who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13). |
| Leviticus 19:16 | “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people” | Sanhedrin 30a:16 | <b>Rather,</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinions is only with regard to the wording of the verdict, and is <b>due to</b> the prohibition of: <b>“You shall not go as a talebearer among your people”</b> (Leviticus 19:16). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that they write that he is <b>exempt due to</b> the prohibition of gossip, as derived from the verse: <b>“You shall not go as a talebearer.”</b> |
| Leviticus 19:16 | leaves | Sanhedrin 31a:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves</b> the courtroom, he should not say: I deemed you exempt and my colleagues deemed you liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me and consequently you were deemed liable? About this it is stated: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people” (Leviticus 19:16), and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets, but one who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves he should not say: I deemed</b> you <b>exempt and my colleagues deemed</b> you <b>liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me</b> and consequently you were deemed liable? <b>The verse states: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people”</b> (Leviticus 19:16), <b>and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets”</b> (Proverbs 11:13). |
| Leviticus 19:16 | life? The verse states: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another” | Sanhedrin 73a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that with regard to one who pursues another</b> in order <b>to kill him,</b> the pursued party <b>may be saved at</b> the cost of the pursuer’s <b>life? The verse states: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another”</b> (Leviticus 19:16); rather, you must save him from death. The Gemara asks: <b>But does this</b> verse really <b>come to</b> teach us <b>this? This</b> verse <b>is required for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who sees another drowning in a river, or being dragged away by</b> a wild <b>animal, or being attacked by bandits [<i>listin</i>], is obligated to save him? The Torah states: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another.”</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so</b> that this verse relates to the obligation to save one whose life is in danger. |
| Leviticus 19:16 | animal, or being attacked by bandits, is obligated to save him? The verse states: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another” | Sanhedrin 73a:7 | Concerning <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who sees another drowning in a river, or being dragged away by</b> a wild <b>animal, or being attacked by bandits, is obligated to save him? The verse states: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another”</b> (Leviticus 19:16). The Gemara asks about this derivation: <b>But is this</b> really <b>derived from here?</b> It is <b>derived from there,</b> i.e., from a different verse, as it is taught: The Torah teaches that one must return lost property to its rightful owner. But <b>from where</b> is it derived that one must help his neighbor who may suffer <b>the loss of his body</b> or his health? <b>The verse states: “And you shall restore it [<i>vahashevato</i>] to him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), which can also be read as: And you shall restore him [<i>vehashevato</i>] to him, i.e., saving his body. Consequently, there should be no need for the additional verse: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another.” |
| Leviticus 19:17 | “You shall not hate your brother in your heart; | Arakhin 16b:4 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not hate your brother in your heart;</b> you shall rebuke [<i>hokhe’aḥ tokhiaḥ</i>] your neighbor, and do not bear sin because of him” (Leviticus 19:17). Why does the verse specify “in your heart”? One <b>might</b> have thought that the verse means: <b>Do not hit him, do not slap him, and do not ruin him</b> due to hatred. Therefore <b>the verse states “in your heart.”</b> This teaches that <b>the verse speaks</b> of <b>hatred in the heart.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:17 | “you shall not hate your brother in your heart” | Nedarim 65b:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And Rabbi Meir further said:</b> The halakhic authorities <b>may broach</b> dissolution <b>with him from that which is written in the Torah, and</b> they <b>may say to him: Had you known that</b> through your vow <b>you are transgressing</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not take vengeance”</b> (Leviticus 19:18) <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>“nor bear any grudge”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), and <b>“you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), as well as <b>“and your brother</b> should <b>live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36), <b>as he,</b> the one prohibited by the vow, <b>is poor and</b> now <b>you are not able to provide him</b> with a livelihood due to your vow, would you have vowed in that case? If <b>he said</b> in reply: <b>Had I known that it is so,</b> that my vow involved all these prohibitions, <b>I would not have vowed; it is dissolved.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:17 | But isn’t it written: “You shall not hate your brother in your heart” | Pesachim 113b:5 | <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the verse is referring to <b>a Jew who hates</b> you. <b>But is one permitted to hate</b> a fellow Jew? <b>But isn’t it written: “You shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), which clearly prohibits the hatred of another Jew? <b>Rather,</b> perhaps you will say that the verse is referring to a situation <b>where there are witnesses that he performed a sin.</b> However, in that case, <b>everyone</b> else should <b>also hate him. What is different</b> about this particular person who hates him? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to a case like this, when he saw him</b> perform <b>a licentious matter?</b> He is therefore permitted to hate him for his evil behavior, whereas others who are unaware of his actions may not hate him. |
| Leviticus 19:17 | which the Torah said: “You shall not hate your brother in your heart” | Sotah 3a:17 | <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> He <b>holds in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: With regard to</b> that <b>which the Torah said: “You shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), one <b>might</b> have thought that this prohibition applies in a case <b>such as this</b> one, when one sees his wife behaving improperly with another man, and the verse would instruct the husband to avoid conflict and strife. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the spirit of jealousy came upon him, and he warned his wife”</b> (Numbers 5:14), teaching that it is permitted for one to issue a warning to his wife in such a case. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself” | Bava Kamma51a:3 | Rav Naḥman answered him: <b>And according to your reasoning, let us make</b> the structure a minimal <b>ten</b> handbreadths. Why must it have a height of two people? <b>Rather,</b> no proof can be brought from here, since the reason is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that the <b>verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Therefore, the structure used for stoning is constructed sufficiently high that he dies quickly, without any unnecessary suffering. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | the verse says: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Ketubot 37b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, just as there,</b> in the case of the beheaded calf, it is beheaded <b>with a cleaver [<i>kofitz</i>] and at the nape of the neck, here too</b> the court executes murderers <b>with a cleaver and at the nape of the neck. Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that <b>the verse says: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), from which it is derived: <b>Choose for him an agreeable death.</b> It is prohibited to abuse a guilty person while executing him, and chopping off his head with a cleaver is an unseemly death. The murderer is beheaded from the neck, not with a cleaver, and not by the other methods employed in beheading the calf. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Kiddushin 41a:5 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say: With regard to this</b> particular mitzva of betrothal, <b>it also involves a prohibition, in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: It is forbidden for a man to betroth a woman until he sees her, lest he see something repulsive in her</b> after the betrothal, <b>and she will become repugnant to him,</b> which will cause him to hate her. <b>And</b> to prevent this violation of what <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), the Sages ruled that a man must betroth a woman in person, to ensure that he approves of her. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | “you shall not take vengeance” | Nedarim 65b:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And Rabbi Meir further said:</b> The halakhic authorities <b>may broach</b> dissolution <b>with him from that which is written in the Torah, and</b> they <b>may say to him: Had you known that</b> through your vow <b>you are transgressing</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not take vengeance”</b> (Leviticus 19:18) <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>“nor bear any grudge”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), and <b>“you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), as well as <b>“and your brother</b> should <b>live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36), <b>as he,</b> the one prohibited by the vow, <b>is poor and</b> now <b>you are not able to provide him</b> with a livelihood due to your vow, would you have vowed in that case? If <b>he said</b> in reply: <b>Had I known that it is so,</b> that my vow involved all these prohibitions, <b>I would not have vowed; it is dissolved.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:18 | prohibited for a person to engage in intercourse by day, as it is stated: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself” | Niddah 17a:11 | § <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> It is <b>prohibited for a person to engage in intercourse by day, as it is stated: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18). The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred? Abaye says:</b> If one engages in intercourse by day, <b>perhaps</b> the husband <b>will see some repulsive matter in</b> his wife <b>and she will become repugnant to him,</b> which will cause him to hate her, and he will thereby violate this mitzva. <b>Rav Huna says: Jews are holy, and they do not engage in intercourse by day.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:18 | the verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself” | Pesachim 75a:15 | The Gemara challenges: <b>Let us</b> execute <b>her with</b> boiling <b>water heated by fire.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18). When executing someone, <b>select for him a kind death.</b> Even when someone must be executed, his dignity should be protected. He should be executed in the most comfortable way possible. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sanhedrin 45a:13 | <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned man, <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Therefore, even though the one being executed is likely to die from a fall from a lesser height, a platform is built that is twice the height of an ordinary person in order to ensure a quick and relatively painless death. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, they should raise</b> the platform even <b>higher.</b> The Gemara answers: This is not done, <b>because</b> if the condemned man were pushed from a higher platform, <b>he would become</b> seriously <b>disfigured,</b> and this would no longer be considered a compassionate form of death. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sanhedrin 45a:8 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>two</b> forms of chastening, both stoning and humiliation, <b>should be done to her, Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Therefore, when putting a woman to death by stoning, she should not be humiliated in the process. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sanhedrin 52a:23 | <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), which teaches that even with regard to a condemned prisoner one should <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> The method of burning described in the mishna is certainly faster and less painful than the burning of the entire body. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sanhedrin 52b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But say that</b> the executioner <b>should cut him in half [<i>gistera</i>],</b> down the middle of his body. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), which teaches that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, one should <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Cutting his body in half is not a compassionate manner of execution. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sanhedrin 52b:20 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> so, perhaps it should be derived that <b>just as there,</b> the heifer is decapitated <b>with a cleaver and at the nape of the neck, so too here,</b> murderers should be decapitated <b>with a cleaver and at the nape of the neck.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), which teaches that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, one should <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Although the type of capital punishment is derived from the heifer whose neck is broken, the most compassionate method of decapitation is selected. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sanhedrin 84b:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether a son may let blood for his father?</b> Is he liable for wounding his father? <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18); just as one would want others to heal him when the need arises, one must heal others when the need arises. It is prohibited for one to do to others only those actions that he would not want done to him. Therefore, it is permitted for one to heal his father even if the procedure entails wounding him. <b>Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana says:</b> This is derived from the juxtaposition between <b>one who strikes a person and one who strikes an animal. Just as one who strikes an animal for medical</b> purposes is <b>exempt</b> from paying restitution, <b>so too, one who strikes a person for medical</b> purposes is <b>exempt</b> from liability. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” | Sotah 8b:2 | <b>And if you would say that two</b> forms of chastening, both stoning and humiliation, <b>should be done with her, Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The <b>verse states: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Therefore, when putting a woman to death by stoning, she should not be humiliated in the process. |
| Leviticus 19:18 | “You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge | Yoma 23a:1 | <b>who does not avenge</b> himself <b>and bear a grudge like a snake</b> when insulted <b>is not</b> considered <b>a Torah scholar</b> at all, as it is important to uphold the honor of Torah and its students by reacting harshly to insults. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> explicitly in the Torah: <b>“You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge</b> against the children of your people” (Leviticus 19:18)? The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> prohibition <b>is written with regard to monetary</b> matters and not personal insults, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is revenge and what is bearing a grudge? Revenge</b> is illustrated by the following example: <b>One said to</b> his fellow: <b>Lend me your sickle,</b> and <b>he said: No. The next day he,</b> the one who had refused to lend the sickle, <b>said to</b> the other person: <b>Lend me your ax.</b> If he <b>said to him: I will not lend to you, just as you did not lend to me, that is revenge.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:19 | The verse states: “You shall not sow your field with diverse kinds of seed” | Avodah Zarah64a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Akiva?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “You shall not sow your field with diverse kinds of seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the case of <b>one who sows. From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who maintains</b> diverse kinds also receives lashes? <b>The verse states: “Not…diverse kinds of seed,”</b> indicating that there should not be diverse kinds in one’s field. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | with a diverse kind” | Bava Metzia91a:11 | <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raises an objection</b> against this opinion, from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Had</b> the Torah <b>stated</b> merely: <b>“You shall not let your cattle copulate,” I would have said</b> that it is prohibited to assist animals in their mating at all, and consequently <b>a person may not hold the</b> female <b>animal when a male mounts it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall not let your cattle copulate <b>with a diverse kind”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which indicates that it is prohibited to mate only different species, but not animals of the same type. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | the verse states: “With a diverse kind” | Bava Metzia91b:1 | <b>Had</b> the Torah merely <b>stated: “You shall not let your cattle copulate,” I would have said</b> that <b>a person may not hold the</b> female <b>animal when a male mounts it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “With a diverse kind”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). This shows that <b>it is</b> a crossbreed of <b>diverse kinds that is prohibited,</b> from which it may be inferred that mating an animal of one <b>species with</b> an animal <b>of its</b> own <b>species is permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “Neither shall there come upon you | Beitzah 14b:14 | <b>And if you say</b> that clothes of diverse kinds <b>are suited for one to place underneath himself, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds” (Leviticus 19:19)? This verse teaches that one may not wear this garment, <b>but</b> by Torah law <b>you may spread it beneath you. However, the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so, lest a thread [<i>nima</i>] wind itself around his flesh.</b> This shows that the Sages prohibited even spreading underneath oneself a cloth that contains a mixture of wool and linen. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | diverse kinds underneath them, it is prohibited to sleep on them, as it is stated: “Neither shall there come upon you” | Beitzah 14b:15 | <b>And if you say that</b> the allowance of cloth of diverse kinds is referring to a case where <b>there is something separating between them,</b> i.e., one may place a garment of diverse kinds beneath another object, <b>but didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said, in the name of the sacred congregation in Jerusalem: Even</b> in a case of <b>ten mattresses</b> placed <b>one on top of the other and</b> a cloth of <b>diverse kinds underneath them, it is prohibited to sleep on them, as it is stated: “Neither shall there come upon you”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). |
| Leviticus 19:19 | As it is written: “You shall not let your cattle mate with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed” | Chullin 115a:6 | The Gemara objects: <b>But say</b> instead that the uniqueness of <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard</b> is that they <b>are prohibited both for consumption and for benefit,</b> whereas <b>diverse kinds of seeds are prohibited for consumption</b> but <b>are permitted for benefit.</b> The Gemara responds: One cannot say that diverse kinds of seeds are prohibited for consumption, as <b>they are juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to diverse kinds of animals,</b> whose offspring are permitted. <b>As it is written: “You shall not let your cattle mate with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). The juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>your cattle,</b> the animal <b>that comes from</b> diverse species <b>is permitted, so too,</b> with regard to <b>your field, that</b> produce <b>that comes from</b> diverse seeds <b>is permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:19 | mating | Chullin 71a:5 | The principle that <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i></b> is relevant <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>mating</b> one species with another. The Torah states the prohibition with regard to a <i>behema</i>: “You shall not let your animal [<i>behema</i>] mate with a diverse kind” (Leviticus 19:19). Nevertheless, this is understood as referring to both a <i>behema</i> and a <i>ḥayya</i>. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “You shall keep My statutes” | Kiddushin 39a:8 | The Gemara adds that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> The verse states: <b>“You shall keep My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which means that one must keep even the <b>statutes that I have already instituted for you</b> when you were merely descendants of Noah, before the giving of the Torah. Shmuel elaborates: This is referring to the prohibitions stated in that same verse: <b>“You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field</b> with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19). |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “Your field you shall not sow with diverse kinds” | Makkot 21b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“Your field you shall not sow with diverse kinds”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>sowing</b> diverse kinds is prohibited. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>maintaining</b> diverse kinds, which does not involve any positive action, is also prohibited? It is as <b>the verse states: “Your animals you shall not breed with different species [<i>kilayim</i>]; your field you shall not sow with diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which is interpreted as though it is written: Diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>] in your field you shall not sow, indicating that one may not allow diverse kinds to remain in his field. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “You shall not sow your field with mingled seed” | Moed Katan2b:13 | With regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion? How did he derive this prohibition from the verses? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not sow your field with mingled seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>I have</b> derived from this verse that <b>only sowing</b> diverse kinds is prohibited. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>maintaining</b> diverse kinds, which does not involve any positive action, is also prohibited? |
| Leviticus 19:19 | your field | Moed Katan2b:14 | <b>The verse states: “Diverse kinds, you shall not</b> sow <b>your field</b> with mingled seed” (Leviticus 19:19). The prohibition against planting different species of a crop in one area of the same field is preceded in the verse by the prohibition against crossbreeding livestock: “You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind.” A slight change in punctuation yields the phrase: Diverse kinds in your field, you shall not, indicating that merely preserving diverse kinds in one’s field is prohibited. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | diverse kinds, is flogged | Moed Katan2b:8 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from what is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who weeds</b> in proximity to diverse kinds of seeds, <b>or covers</b> with earth the exposed roots of <b>diverse kinds, is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition against diverse kinds, i.e., tending different species of crops in one area of the same field, as it is stated: “You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19). <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species that he could have uprooted is flogged for violating the prohibition against diverse kinds of seeds. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | which the verse states: “My statutes you shall keep. | Sanhedrin 60a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that descendants of Noah were <b>also</b> commanded <b>about</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Shmuel says:</b> They are derived from that <b>which the verse states: “My statutes you shall keep.</b> You shall not breed your animal with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19). God is saying: Keep the <b>statutes that I have already instituted for you,</b> i.e., mitzvot that were already given to the descendants of Noah, namely, <b>“you shall not breed your animal with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed.”</b> |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “Neither shall there come upon you | Tamid 27b:2 | <b>And if you would say</b> that with regard to <b>diverse kinds it is</b> only <b>placing</b> the garment <b>upon</b> oneself <b>or wearing</b> it <b>that is prohibited, but</b> as for <b>spreading</b> it <b>beneath you,</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> this explanation is difficult. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds” (Leviticus 19:19). One should infer as follows: <b>But you may spread</b> a garment of diverse kinds <b>beneath you,</b> in order to lie upon it. The <i>baraita</i> continues: This is the <i>halakha</i> by Torah law, <b>but the Sages said</b> that <b>it is prohibited to do so, lest a single fiber wrap</b> itself <b>upon his flesh,</b> which would cause him to be in transgression of the Torah prohibition. Accordingly, the priests should not be permitted to place vestments made of diverse kinds beneath their heads. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | written: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds mingled together” | Yevamot 4b:2 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is <b>because</b> it <b>is evident; as, if</b> it is <b>so</b> that no inference should be drawn from the adjacent verses, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> this verse <b>by the portion of ritual fringes</b> (Numbers, chapter 15). With regard <b>to what <i>halakha</i></b> did the Torah <b>write it here?</b> Clearly, the Torah is teaching a <i>halakha</i> from the adjacent verses. <b>And if you wish, say</b> it is <b>because</b> this verse is <b>free, since</b> the Torah has already <b>written: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds mingled together”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>Why,</b> then, <b>do I</b> need the verse: <b>“You shall not wear diverse kinds,</b> wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11)? <b>Learn from this that</b> the verse is <b>free</b> for the derivation of a homiletic interpretation from juxtaposed verses. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | Since it is written: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds mingled together” | Yevamot 4b:6 | How so? <b>Since it is written: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds mingled together”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since</b> the word <b>garments is stated in the Torah unmodified,</b> without stating from what materials those garments were made, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references to garments, in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity of leprosy: <b>“A woolen garment or a linen garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:47), the following conclusion can be drawn: Just as when the Torah mentions a garment in the case of leprosy it is referring to one made of wool or linen, <b>so too, all</b> garments mentioned in the Torah are those made from <b>wool or linen.</b> Other fabrics are not classified as those used for garments. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“Wool and linen” that the Merciful One wrote</b> with regard to diverse kinds? <b>Learn from this that</b> the superfluous passage is <b>free.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:19 | placing | Yevamot 4b:8 | The Gemara responds: <b>If so, let the verse be silent</b> and refrain <b>from</b> mentioning wool and linen at all, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only wearing wool and linen together is prohibited can <b>be derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“diverse kinds”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), and <b>“diverse kinds”</b> from <b>placing</b> a covering of diverse kinds upon oneself (Leviticus 19:19). The repetition of wool and linen must be coming to teach that one should derive a homiletic interpretation from these juxtaposed verses. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “diverse kinds.” | Yevamot 5b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>And still,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the verse to state “diverse kinds [<i>sha’atnez</i>],” as this is interpreted as an acronym that teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of diverse kinds applies only <b>when it is smooth combed [<i>shoa</i>], spun [<i>tavui</i>]</b> as a thread, <b>and attached [<i>noz</i>],</b> but without these characteristics the connection is not considered diverse kinds. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that <b>the entire</b> interpretation <b>is derived from</b> the term <b>“diverse kinds.”</b> Since the Torah uses the highly distinctive word “<i>sha’atnez</i>,” in addition to functioning as the above acronym it serves as the source of the verbal analogy with the term in the verse: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds [<i>sha’atnez</i>] mingled together” (Leviticus 19:19), from which it may be inferred that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition. |
| Leviticus 19:19 | “Neither shall there come upon you | Yoma 69a:5 | <b>And if you say</b> that with regard to the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> only <b>wearing</b> or <b>placing</b> the garment <b>upon oneself is prohibited, but spreading them out</b> and lying upon them on <b>is permitted,</b> and as such it should be permitted for the priests to sleep upon their vestments, this is incorrect. As, <b>wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds”(Leviticus 19:19), which implies: <b>But you are permitted to spread it beneath you</b> to lie upon. This is true according to Torah law, <b>but the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so, lest a fiber wrap upon his flesh,</b> which would lead to the transgression of the Torah prohibition. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “To her” | Chagigah 4a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i>? <b>After all,</b> with regard to <b>every mitzva in which a woman is obligated, a slave is</b> also <b>obligated in that</b> mitzva; and with regard to <b>every mitzva in which a woman is not obligated, a slave is not obligated in it</b> either. The reason for this principle is <b>that it is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the phrase: <b>“To her”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), written with regard to a designated maidservant, and the phrase: <b>“To her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), written with regard <b>to a</b> divorced <b>woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | and not at all redeemed, | Gittin 39b:11 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Akiva:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that paying <b>money completes</b> the emancipation of a Hebrew maidservant, <b>just as a bill</b> of manumission <b>completes her</b> emancipation. <b>The verse states,</b> concerning a Jewish man who engages in sexual intercourse with a maidservant who had been designated to cohabit with a Hebrew slave: “And whoever lies carnally with a woman that is a bondmaid designated for a man, <b>and not at all redeemed,</b> nor was freedom given to her; there shall be inquisition; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free” (Leviticus 19:20). In this case, neither the Jewish man nor the maidservant is liable to receive the death penalty, in contrast to a man who engages in sexual intercourse with a married woman. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “to her [ lah ],” | Gittin 39b:2 | The Gemara continues explaining the possible inference. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He derived</b> this by means of a verbal analogy, understanding the meaning of <b>“to her [<i>lah</i>],”</b> written with regard to a maidservant in the verse: “Nor was freedom given to her” (Leviticus 19:20), <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>“for her [<i>lah</i>],”</b> written with regard to <b>a wife:</b> “And he writes for her a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>Just as a wife</b> is released from her husband <b>via a bill</b> of divorce, <b>so too, a slave</b> is <b>also</b> emancipated only <b>via a bill</b> of manumission. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | The verse states: “And not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given to her” | Gittin 41b:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that she can be partially redeemed <b>via money. From where</b> do I derive that she can also be emancipated <b>via a bill</b> of manumission? <b>The verse states: “And not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given to her”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), <b>and later on,</b> in the case of divorce, <b>it states: “And he writes her a scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>Just as later on</b> freedom is granted <b>via a bill</b> of divorce, <b>so too here,</b> a maidservant is freed <b>via a bill</b> of manumission. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “And not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given to her” | Gittin 41b:3 | <b>Rabba said:</b> Their <b>dispute</b> pertains only to a case where the master emancipated him <b>with a bill</b> of manumission, <b>as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds:</b> In the context of a Jewish man who engages in sexual intercourse with a maidservant who had been designated to cohabit with a Hebrew slave, the Torah writes that neither the Jewish man nor the maidservant is liable to receive the death penalty, though the man is liable to bring a guilt-offering. If the woman had been emancipated, she would be a regular married woman, and they would incur the death penalty for their act of intercourse. In describing the woman in that case, the Torah writes: <b>“And not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given to her”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This is referring to two methods of emancipating a slave: Redemption via money, in the phrase: “And not at all redeemed,” and emancipation via a bill of manumission, in the phrase: “Nor was freedom given her.” |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “her [ lah ]” | Gittin 41b:5 | <b>And the Rabbis derive</b> their opinion, that a slave cannot acquire half of his freedom via a bill of manumission, <b>from</b> a verbal analogy of the word <b>“her [<i>lah</i>]”</b> written here: “Nor was freedom given to her [<i>lah</i>]” (Leviticus 19:20), and the word <b>“her [<i>lah</i>]”</b> written with regard to a man who divorces <b>a woman:</b> “And he writes her [<i>lah</i>] a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a woman,</b> one is <b>not</b> able to divorce <b>half of her</b> with a bill of divorce, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b>a slave,</b> one is <b>not</b> able to emancipate <b>half of him</b> with a bill of manumission. <b>However, with regard to</b> a slave who frees himself by giving <b>money, everyone agrees that</b> the slave <b>acquires</b> half of himself, and a female slave would also be partially <b>redeemed but not</b> fully <b>redeemed.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “And not at all redeemed [ vehofde lo nifdata ]” | Gittin 41b:8 | <b>And Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis pertains only to a case where the slave was freed <b>via money, for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a slave can be half-freed can be derived from the phrase: <b>“And not at all redeemed [<i>vehofde lo nifdata</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), indicating that she has been partially <b>redeemed but not</b> fully <b>redeemed. And the Rabbis hold: The Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> and the repetition of the verb in the verse is not to be used as a source for deriving a <i>halakha</i>. <b>However,</b> when the slave is half-emancipated <b>via a bill</b> of manumission, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the slave has <b>not acquired</b> himself and remains a full slave. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “They shall not be put to death, because she was not free” | Gittin 43b:3 | <b>Rabbi Zeira says: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to one who engages in sexual intercourse with a designated maidservant: <b>“They shall not be put to death, because she was not free”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), and one can infer: <b>But</b> if <b>she was free,</b> then <b>they will be put to death,</b> because she is a married woman. This teaches that her betrothal is complete once she is emancipated. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “And she was redeemed” | Keritot 11a:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Which is</b> the espoused <b>maidservant?</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, it is any woman who is half-maidservant and half-free woman, whereas Rabbi Yishmael maintains that it is referring to a full-fledged maidservant. In relation to this dispute, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the verse: <b>“And she was redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20): One <b>might</b> have thought that this means she was <b>entirely</b> redeemed. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And she was redeemed <b>and not redeemed,”</b> to teach that she was not entirely redeemed. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought that she <b>was not redeemed</b> at all. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And she was redeemed,”</b> to teach that it is discussing a maidservant who was partially redeemed. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | because she was not free” | Keritot 11a:13 | The Gemara objects: <b>According to Rabbi Yishmael, granted</b> that the phrase <b>“and she was redeemed and not redeemed”</b> is referring simply to a Canaanite maidservant, <b>as it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Torah spoke in the language of people. But from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> which <b>is taught,</b> i.e., that <b>she is betrothed</b> specifically <b>to a Hebrew slave?</b> The Gemara explains that it is <b>as it is written:</b> “They shall not be put to death, <b>because she was not free”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). <b>By inference,</b> it may be concluded <b>that he,</b> the man to whom she is betrothed, <b>is free.</b> A Hebrew slave is not the property of his owner, but is merely obligated to serve him for a period of time. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | as it is stated: “And she was redeemed and not redeemed” | Keritot 11a:2 | <b>Who is</b> the espoused <b>maidservant</b> in question? It is <b>any</b> woman <b>who is half-maidservant half-free woman,</b> i.e., a maidservant who belonged to two masters, one of whom liberated her, <b>as it is stated: “And she was redeemed and not redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), which means that she was partially but not completely redeemed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> An espoused maidservant is a full-fledged <b>maidservant</b> whose status is <b>certain,</b> as the language of the verse does not mean redeemed and not redeemed; it is simply a way of stating that she was not redeemed. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: All those with whom relations are forbidden</b> are <b>enumerated</b> in the Torah, <b>and we have no exception other than one who is half-maidservant half-free woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | man…there shall be an inspection [ bikkoret tihye ]” | Keritot 11a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in the case of an espoused maidservant the Torah did not equate the man with the woman. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that she is flogged and</b> that <b>he is not flogged? As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman, and she is a maidservant designated for a <b>man…there shall be an inspection [<i>bikkoret tihye</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This <b>teaches that she is flogged.</b> And as one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both are flogged, the verse states: “There shall be [<i>tihye</i>],”</b> in the feminine, to teach that <b>she is flogged and he is not flogged.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | written with regard to an intentional | Keritot 9a:28 | The Gemara objects: <b>But when this verse is written,</b> it is <b>written with regard to an intentional</b> transgression, as the verse states: “There shall be an inspection” (Leviticus 19:20), which indicates a punishment of lashes, and lashes are given only for an intentional transgression. The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, say</b> that the language of the <i>baraita</i> should be reversed, as follows: The phrase “that he has sinned” <b>renders</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression to be the same <b>as</b> it is with regard to <b>an intentional</b> transgression. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | and she is a maidservant | Keritot 9b:1 | <b>and she is a maidservant</b> designated to a man” (Leviticus 19:20). This verse likewise serves <b>to</b> require <b>separate</b> offerings <b>for each and every</b> espoused <b>maidservant.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “to her [ lah ],” | Kiddushin 23a:15 | <b>Rabba said: What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar? He derives</b> this by means of a verbal analogy, understanding the meaning of <b>“to her [<i>lah</i>],”</b> written with regard to a maidservant in the verse: “Nor was freedom given to her” (Leviticus 19:20), <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>“for her [<i>lah</i>],”</b> written with regard to <b>a wife:</b> “And he writes for her a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>Just as a woman</b> is not divorced <b>until</b> the husband <b>moves</b> the <b>bill of divorce</b> from his domain <b>to a domain that is not his,</b> and the bill of divorce is ineffective as long as it remains in his domain; <b>so too, a slave</b> is not freed <b>unless</b> the master <b>moves</b> the <b>bill</b> of manumission <b>to a domain that is not his.</b> Since the slave belongs to him, the document will remain the master’s even if he gives it to the slave. Therefore, he can be freed by means of a document only through other people who receive the document on his behalf. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | my espoused one, she is betrothed, as it is stated: “Who is a maidservant espoused [ neḥerefet ] to a man” | Kiddushin 6a:6 | The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as it is stated: “Who is a maidservant espoused [<i>neḥerefet</i>] to a man”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This verse means that she is betrothed to a certain man. <b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> adds another proof for this claim: <b>In Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it reasonable to introduce the custom in <b>Judea</b> with the term: <b>And furthermore,</b> as proof <b>to</b> a <i>halakha</i> derived from <b>a verse? Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>espoused, in Judea, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | Abaye raised an objection to | Sanhedrin 69a:2 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> discussing a designated maidservant, about whom the verse states: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a maidservant designated to a man, and not fully redeemed, nor freedom given her, inquiry shall be made; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free” (Leviticus 19:20). From the word <b>“man,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to an adult <b>man.</b> But as for a minor <b>aged nine years and one day, who is fit for</b> engaging in <b>intercourse, from where</b> is it derived that he too is subject to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “And</b> if <b>a man.”</b> The extraneous letter <i>vav</i>, meaning “and,” serves to include a minor who is nine years old, as already at that age he can perform complete intercourse. |
| Leviticus 19:20 | cohabitation with seed, | Yevamot 55a:23 | The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One reveals with regard to a designated maidservant</b> that the prohibition has been violated only through an act of <b>cohabitation with seed,</b> i.e., a complete act of sexual intercourse, in the verse “And whoever lies with a woman in cohabitation with seed, and she is a bondmaid designated to a man” (Leviticus 19:20), <b>by inference, those liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for</b> violating ordinary <b>prohibitions</b> are liable even <b>through the initial stage of intercourse.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:20 | “cohabitation with seed” | Yevamot 55b:5 | § <b>Rava said:</b> Now that it has been established that the initial stage of intercourse is considered an act of sexual intercourse, <b>why do I</b> need the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20) <b>that the Merciful One writes with regard to a designated maidservant;</b> the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Leviticus 18:20) written <b>with regard to a married woman;</b> and the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Numbers 5:13) written with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> |
| Leviticus 19:21 | “ram” | Keritot 22b:19 | The Gemara asks: What is the source of this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>guilt offering</b> for engaging in intercourse with <b>an espoused maidservant, about which</b> the term <b>“your valuation”</b> is <b>not written</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers: <b>We derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“ram”</b> (Leviticus 5:15) in the verse about a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property and the word <b>“ram”</b> (Leviticus 19:21) in a verse concerning the espoused maidservant. |
| Leviticus 19:22 | for his sin that he has sinned” | Keritot 9a:17 | <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord <b>for his sin that he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 19:22). The superfluous phrase: That he has sinned, <b>teaches that</b> he <b>brings one offering for several transgressions.</b> Furthermore, the verse concludes: <b>“With the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord for his sin that he has sinned; <b>and he shall be forgiven for his sin that he has sinned.”</b> The second occurrence of the phrase “that he has sinned” serves <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression the same <b>as</b> it is with regard to <b>an intentional</b> transgression, that one brings a guilt offering in either case. |
| Leviticus 19:22 | for his sin that he has sinned” | Keritot 9a:27 | The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord <b>for his sin that he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 19:22). The superfluous phrase “that he has sinned” <b>teaches that</b> he <b>brings one offering for several transgressions.</b> Furthermore, the verse concludes: <b>“With the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord for his sin that he has sinned; <b>and he shall be forgiven for his sin that he has sinned.”</b> The second instance of the phrase “that he has sinned” serves <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an intentional</b> transgression the same <b>as</b> it is with regard to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression, that one brings a guilt offering in either case. |
| Leviticus 19:22 | “with the ram” | Zevachim 48a:19 | The Gemara answers that it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“with the ram”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering for mis-use of consecrated property (Leviticus 5:16) and the term <b>“with the ram”</b> stated with regard to the guilt offering for engaging in sexual intercourse with an espoused maidservant (Leviticus 19:22). |
| Leviticus 19:23 | it shall not be eaten” | Bava Kamma101a:13 | The Gemara rejects this resolution. <b>Rava said:</b> The reason the garment must be burned is not because the dye remains an independent substance. Rather, it is because <b>the Torah prohibited benefit that is visible to the eye, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>areilim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> it; <b>from where</b> is it derived that one <b>may not</b> even derive <b>benefit from it, and</b> that <b>one may not dye with</b> dyes extracted from the fruit, <b>and</b> that <b>one may not light a lamp with</b> oil extracted from the fruit? |
| Leviticus 19:23 | it shall not be eaten” | Bava Kamma101a:14 | The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “Then you shall count the fruit thereof [<i>orlato</i>] as forbidden [<i>araltem</i>].</b> Three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>areilim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), <b>to include all these</b> types of benefit in the prohibition. Consequently, there is an explicit derivation that an item dyed with <i>orla</i> dye is forbidden. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | The Gemara raised an objection | Berakhot 36b:15 | <b>The Gemara raised an objection</b> to this based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>, that regarding the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>Rabbi Meir would say: By inference from that which is stated: “You shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>,” don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food? Rather,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Any tree for food”? To include a tree whose wood and fruit have the same taste. And which</b> tree <b>is this? This is the pepper</b> tree. <b>And</b> this comes <b>to teach you that the peppers,</b> and even the wood portions, are edible and are therefore <b>obligated in</b> the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>, and to teach that Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Obviously,</b> peppers are fit for consumption. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | you shall regard its fruit [ et piryo ] as orla ” | Berakhot 36b:3 | The Gemara approaches this matter from a different perspective: <b>Let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that buds are included in the prohibition of <i>orla</i> from the fact that the bud <b>serves as protection for the fruit, and the Torah says:</b> “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food <b>you shall regard its fruit [<i>et piryo</i>] as <i>orla</i>”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), and <b><i>et piryo</i></b> is interpreted to mean <b>that which is secondary to the fruit. What is that? That</b> section of the plant <b>which is protection for the fruit.</b> The buds should be prohibited as <i>orla</i>, since they protect the fruit. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | fruit. | Chullin 121a:1 | <b>And then he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> liquid that emerges from <b><i>orla</i> from first fruits</b> via a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>fruit</b> and another instance of the word <b>fruit.</b> With regard to <i>orla</i> the verse states: “And you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden” (Leviticus 19:23), and with regard to first fruits the verse states: “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground” (Deuteronomy 26:2). Therefore, just as with regard to first fruits the status of liquid that emerges from the produce is like that of the produce only with regard to grapes and olives, so too with regard to <i>orla</i> one receives lashes only for drinking the liquid of grapes and olives, but not for drinking the liquid of other types of produce. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | it shall not be eaten” | Kiddushin 56b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the source of the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the items mentioned in the mishna. <b>With <i>orla</i>: From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from <i>orla</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> it. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one may not even derive <b>benefit</b> from it? From where do we derive <b>that one may not</b> derive <b>benefit from it</b> in another manner, <b>and one may not paint with</b> the dye that can be extracted from the fruit, <b>and one may not light a lamp with</b> its oil? <b>The verse states: “Then you shall count the fruit thereof [<i>orlato</i>] as forbidden [<i>araltem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), <b>to include all these</b> types of benefit in the prohibition. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | it shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 22b:12 | The Gemara further challenges: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition of <b>fruit that grows on a tree during the first three years after it was planted [<i>orla</i>], as the Merciful One says:</b> “And when you come into the land, and you shall plant all types of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as prohibited; three years shall it be <b>prohibited [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Shall it be <b>prohibited</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”: I have only derived a prohibition to eat</b> it. <b>From where do I derive that one may not</b> even <b>benefit from it,</b> e.g., that <b>he may not paint with</b> the dye that can be extracted from the fruit, <b>nor may he light a lamp with</b> its oil? <b>The verse states: “You shall count the fruit thereof [<i>orlato</i>] as prohibited [<i>araltem</i>];</b> three years shall it be <b>prohibited [<i>arelim</i>] to you; it shall not be eaten.”</b> This repetition of the term <i>arel</i> comes <b>to include all forms</b> of benefit. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | prohibited [ arelim ] | Rosh Hashanah9b:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the New Year <b>for planting.</b> It determines the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “Three years</b> shall it be <b>prohibited [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“And in the fourth year</b> all its fruit will be sacred for giving praise to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24). <b>And</b> it is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Tishrei, as it is written</b> with regard to Tishrei: <b>“From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). |
| Leviticus 19:23 | thereof as forbidden [ orlato ]; | Shabbat 108a:7 | Karna also asked: <b>From where</b> is derived <b>that circumcision is</b> performed <b>in that place?</b> Rav answered him: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to circumcision: “And on the eighth day he shall circumcise the flesh of <b>his foreskin [<i>orlato</i>]</b>” (Leviticus 12:3), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to recently planted trees: “And when you come to the land and plant all types of fruit trees, and you shall count the fruit <b>thereof as forbidden [<i>orlato</i>];</b> three years shall it be as forbidden unto you, it shall not be eaten.” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>Just as there</b> the Torah is referring to a tree, which <b>is an item that bears fruit, here, too,</b> in the case of circumcision, <i>orla</i> is referring to <b>an item that bears fruit.</b> He asked him: <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s heart, as it is written: “And you shall circumcise the foreskin of [<i>orlat</i>] your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16)? <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s ear, as it is written: “Behold, their ear is dull [<i>areila</i>]</b> and they cannot listen” (Jeremiah 6:10)? Rav said to him: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> another instance of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i>; and one does not derive</b> the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> the <b>incomplete</b> form <b><i>orlat,</i></b> which modifies another word, as is also the case with the word <i>areila</i>. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | as it was taught | Sukkah 35a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that it is referring to the <b>pepper</b> tree, since the taste of its trunk and the taste of its fruit are alike, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> that <b>by inference from that which is stated</b> “and plant any tree,” <b>don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food? Rather,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Any tree for food”?</b> It is <b>to include a tree that the taste of its tree</b> trunk <b>and</b> the taste of its <b>fruit are alike. And which</b> tree <b>is this? You must say this is the pepper</b> tree. This comes <b>to teach you that the peppers,</b> and even its trunk, are edible, and therefore the tree is <b>obligated</b> in the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>. And Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). From where, then, is it derived that the Torah commands the taking of an <i>etrog</i> as one of the four species? Perhaps the verse is referring to peppers. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | Rabbi Meir would say | Yoma 81b:6 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this. <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> about the verse: “And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit of it as forbidden [<i>orla</i>]; three years it shall be forbidden to you, it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>From the implication of what is stated: “Then you shall count the fruit of it as forbidden,” do I not know that</b> the verse is referring to <b>“trees for food,”</b> since it uses the word “fruit”? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “trees for food”?</b> It includes <b>a tree whose wood and fruit taste the same,</b> i.e., a tree that is itself eaten in addition to its fruit. One <b>must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>pepper</b> that grows on a tree, <b>to teach you that</b> even <b>pepper is subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of <i>orla</i>. And</b> this also teaches that <b>Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing,</b> as even pepper can grow there, <b>as it is stated</b> among the listed praises of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“You will not lack anything in it”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). In any event, it has been derived that pepper is called food, which contradicts Rava’s statement. |
| Leviticus 19:24 | holy, for giving praise | Bava Kamma69b:16 | With regard to <b>a fourth-year vineyard as well,</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> many of its <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between <b>second tithe</b> and fourth-year fruit, based on the use of the word <b>“holy”</b> in the context of fourth-year fruit and <b>“holy”</b> in the context of second tithe. <b>It is written here,</b> concerning fourth-year fruit trees: “And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be <b>holy, for giving praise</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>and it is written with regard to second tithe: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:30). |
| Leviticus 19:24 | “…sanctified for praises before the Lord” | Berakhot 35a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Concerning the fundamental basis for blessings, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> the obligation to recite a blessing before eating, derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Sifra</i>: With regard to saplings, it is stated that in their fourth year their fruit will be: <b>“…sanctified for praises before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:24). This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>they require</b> praise of God in the form of a <b>blessing</b> both <b>beforehand and thereafter,</b> as the verse says praises in the plural. <b>From here, Rabbi Akiva said: A person is forbidden to taste anything before he recites a blessing,</b> as without reciting praise over food, it has the status of a consecrated item, from which one is forbidden to derive pleasure. |
| Leviticus 19:24 | “holy” | Kiddushin 54b:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel? They derive</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“holy”</b> stated with regard to a fourth-year vineyard, as the verse states: “Holy, for giving praise to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>from “holy”</b> stated with regard to second <b>tithe,</b> as the verse states: “Holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:30). This verbal analogy teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> second <b>tithe has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth and it has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal, so too,</b> the <b>fourth-year vineyard has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth and it has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal. And Beit Shammai do not derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“holy”</b> with regard to a fourth-year vineyard and <b>“holy” from</b> second <b>tithe.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:24 | “And in the fourth year | Rosh Hashanah9b:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the New Year <b>for planting.</b> It determines the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “Three years</b> shall it be <b>prohibited [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“And in the fourth year</b> all its fruit will be sacred for giving praise to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24). <b>And</b> it is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Tishrei, as it is written</b> with regard to Tishrei: <b>“From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). |
| Leviticus 19:25 | so that it may increase your produce [ tevuato ]; | Berakhot 35a:5 | <b>And according to the one who taught: A fourth year grapevine, this</b> works out <b>well if he derives</b> this matter <b>from a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>],</b> and therefore need not derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <i>hillulim</i>. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It is stated here</b> with regard to the laws of the prohibition of fruit for the tree’s first three years: “But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, <b>so that it may increase your produce [<i>tevuato</i>];</b> I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:25). <b>And it is stated below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forfeited <b>with the produce [<i>utevuat</i>] of the vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). Based on a verbal analogy, it can be derived: <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards; so too, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the fruits of a sapling, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards.</b> Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, <b>one extra <i>hillul</i></b> remains from which to derive <b>the blessing.</b> Since he derives that the laws of fourth-year saplings apply only to grapes from the verbal analogy, he can derive the requirement to recite blessings before partaking of food from the word <i>hillulim</i>. |
| Leviticus 19:26 | that which is written: “You shall not eat with the blood” | Berakhot 10b:29 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26)? <b>You may not eat before you pray for your blood.</b> One may not eat before he prays. |
| Leviticus 19:26 | of the day? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood” | Moed Katan14b:13 | <b>But</b> if so, the judges <b>would be prevented from rejoicing on the Festival, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to the Sanhedrin who put someone to death that they may not taste</b> any food or drink <b>for the entire</b> rest <b>of the day? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26). It is not appropriate to eat during the same day that they caused bloodshed. |
| Leviticus 19:26 | of a prohibition? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood” | Sanhedrin 63a:20 | <b>As</b> this principle <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who eats from an animal before its soul departs is</b> in transgression <b>of a prohibition? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26), meaning, you shall not eat from the animal while its soul, which is referred to in the Torah as blood, is still within it. |
| Leviticus 19:26 | “Nor shall you practice divination nor soothsaying” | Sanhedrin 66a:2 | <b>The Sages taught</b> that the verse: <b>“Nor shall you practice divination nor soothsaying”</b> (Leviticus 19:26), is referring, <b>for example,</b> to <b>those who divine</b> and receive guidance according to what happens <b>to a weasel, to birds, or to fish.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:27 | a minor boy for me. | Bava Metzia10b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the answers of Ravina and Rav Samma? The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in the case of <b>a priest who said to an Israelite: Go out and betroth a divorced woman for me.</b> It is prohibited for a priest to betroth a divorcée, while it is permitted for an Israelite to do so. <b>Alternatively,</b> the difference is in the case of <b>a man who said to a woman: Round</b> the corners of the head of <b>a minor boy for me.</b> Rounding the corners of a man’s head, and a man having the corners of his head rounded, are prohibited in the verse: “You shall not round the corners of your head” (Leviticus 19:27), but they are prohibited only for men and not for women. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | and: Do not destroy | Kiddushin 29a:7 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all prohibitions, whether</b> they are <b>time-bound</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>not time-bound, both men and women are obligated</b> to observe them, <b>except for</b> the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of your head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard, which are derived from the verse: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), <b>and</b> a prohibition that concerns only priests: <b>Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse</b> (see Leviticus 21:1). These mitzvot apply only to men, not women, despite the fact that they are prohibitions. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | “And you shall not destroy | Kiddushin 35b:10 | The Gemara asks: If so, <b>now too, let us say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and the daughters of Aaron are also prohibited to destroy their beards. <b>And if</b> you maintain that the reason the prohibition stated with regard to priests does not apply to women is <b>due to</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> employing the term “the corners of,” which serves to connect the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to priests with the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to all Jews, that verbal analogy <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off</b> the corners of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest <b>would be liable</b> even if <b>he shaved his</b> beard <b>with scissors.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states,</b> in a command issued to all Jews: <b>“And you shall not destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). This teaches that one is liable only for destroying the beard to the root, which is not achieved with scissors. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | as it is written: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard” | Kiddushin 35b:3 | The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard”</b> (Leviticus 19:27). The juxtaposition of the two prohibitions teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying</b> the beard <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>rounding</b> the head. <b>And since these women are not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying, they are</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>rounding</b> the head. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | as the verse states: “You shall not round the corners of your head [ roshekhem ] and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard [ zekanekha ]” | Kiddushin 35b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> women <b>are not</b> obligated <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying</b> the corners of one’s beard? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, propose</b> a logical <b>reason, as</b> ordinarily women <b>do not have a beard. And if you wish, cite a verse</b> that teaches this point, <b>as the verse states: “You shall not round the corners of your head [<i>roshekhem</i>] and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard [<i>zekanekha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:27). |
| Leviticus 19:27 | “the corners | Kiddushin 35b:7 | <b>Abaye said: You cannot say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to destroying, as it is derived</b> that a woman is exempt through the verbal analogy of <b>“the corners</b> of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27) here and <b>“the corners</b> of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5) <b>from the sons of Aaron: Just as there,</b> in the case of priests, <b>women are</b> certainly <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva, as the verse is referring to the male descendants of Aaron who perform the Temple service and not to women, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the prohibition against destroying one’s beard, which is stated to all Jews, <b>women are exempt.</b> At this stage the Gemara assumes that the exclusion of women denoted by the verse: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), which excludes women, is applied to all the mitzvot stated in that chapter, including destroying the corners of one’s beard. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | the verse states: “You may not mar | Makkot 21a:6 | The mishna teaches: <b>And one is liable</b> for marring the edges of his beard <b>only if he removes</b> the hair <b>with a razor. The Sages taught</b> a halakhic midrash: The verse states: <b>“And the edge of their beard they may not shave”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that for any manner of shaving, <b>even if he shaved</b> the beard <b>with scissors, he would be liable;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “You may not mar</b> the edge of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), indicating that one is liable only for shaving that destroys the hair from the root, which is not the case with scissors. <b>If</b> the verse had stated only: <b>“You may not mar,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that even <b>if he removed</b> the hair <b>with tweezers or with a plane</b> he <b>would be liable</b> to receive lashes, as they destroy the hair from its roots; therefore, <b>the verse states: “They may not shave,”</b> indicating that only hair removal by means of shaving is prohibited, and that is not accomplished with a tweezers and a plane. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | performs the rounding | Nazir 29a:7 | The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said it is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the son must <b>shave</b> all of his hair at the conclusion of his naziriteship, despite the fact that <b>he</b> thereby <b>performs the rounding</b> of the corners of his head, in violation of the prohibition: “You shall not round the corners of your heads” (Leviticus 19:27). Since a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai has the status of Torah law, a minor nazirite shaves despite this prohibition. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | “Neither shall you destroy | Nazir 40b:5 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> this shaving of a leper must be performed <b>with a razor?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the prohibition against a priest shaving his beard in the verse <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5): One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest should <b>be liable even if he shaved</b> his beard <b>with scissors. The verse states,</b> in the general prohibition issued to all Jewish men: <b>“Neither shall you destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). This teaches that one is liable only if he shaves in a destructive manner, by uprooting the hairs entirely, which excludes the use of scissors. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | “You shall not round the corners of your heads” | Nazir 41a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> term: <b>“His head,”</b> which is referring to a leper, <b>what do they learn from it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They require</b> this term <b>to override</b> the <b>prohibition of rounding</b> the corners of the head. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“You shall not round the corners of your heads”</b> (Leviticus 19:27): One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the same</b> should <b>also</b> apply to <b>a leper,</b> that it should also be prohibited for him to round the corners of his head when he shaves. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His head,”</b> with regard to a leper. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | “You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you destroy the corners of your beard” | Nazir 57b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>Since both</b> Rav Huna and Rav Adda <b>maintain</b> that <b>rounding the entire head is called rounding, with regard to what do they disagree?</b> What is the reason for their respective rulings? The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Huna,</b> who prohibits an adult male from rounding the head of a minor but permits a woman to do so, <b>maintains</b> that the association between the two prohibitions in the verse: <b>“You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you destroy the corners of your beard”</b> (Leviticus 19:27), teaches: <b>Whoever has</b> the prohibition of the <b>destruction</b> of the beard also <b>has</b> the prohibition of <b>rounding. And these women, since they are not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition of <b>destruction,</b> as they do not have beards, <b>they are not</b> included in the prohibition of <b>rounding either.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:27 | since it is stated: “You shall not round the corners of your heads” | Nazir 57b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue of whether one who <b>rounds the entire head</b> is considered to have rounded its corners <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a verse that deals with the shaving of a leper: “He shall shave all his hair; <b>his head</b> and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off” (Leviticus 14:9). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “His head,” after it has already stated: “All his hair”? The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>since it is stated: “You shall not round the corners of your heads”</b> (Leviticus 19:27), |
| Leviticus 19:27 | with scissors. The verse states: “And you shall not destroy | Nazir 58b:5 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive that a leper must shave <b>with a razor? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that priests <b>should be liable even if they shaved</b> their beards <b>with scissors. The verse states: “And you shall not destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), which teaches that the prohibition applies only to the destruction of the beard from its roots. <b>If</b> the sole criterion is the phrase <b>“you shall not destroy,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if he extracted</b> his hair <b>with tweezers or</b> removed his hair <b>with</b> a carpenter’s <b>plane, he should</b> likewise <b>be liable</b> due to the prohibition against destroying his hair. |
| Leviticus 19:27 | as it is stated: “You shall not round the corners of your heads” | Yevamot 5a:2 | The Gemara responds: <b>They derive it from</b> the verse mentioned with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the purification of a leper from his leprosy [<i>tzara’at</i>]: “And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off <b>his head</b> and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off” (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Since it states “all his hair,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “his head”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>as it is stated: “You shall not round the corners of your heads”</b> (Leviticus 19:27), i.e., it is prohibited to shave the corners of the head, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a leper is</b> included in this prohibition. |
| Leviticus 19:28 | The Sages taught | Makkot 20b:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And one who cuts one incision</b> in a display of mourning <b>over the dead</b> is flogged. <b>The Sages taught</b> a halakhic midrash on the verse: “And an incision for the soul you shall not place in your flesh” (Leviticus 19:28). Had the verse stated only: <b>“And an incision,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this prohibition applies to any incision cut in sorrow, <b>even</b> if he <b>cut</b> an incision in sorrow <b>over his house that collapsed, or over his ship that sunk at sea.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the soul,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>he is liable</b> for an incision in mourning <b>only for the dead alone. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one who cuts five incisions</b> in mourning <b>over one dead</b> person <b>is liable for each and every</b> incision? <b>The verse states: “And an incision” to render</b> him <b>liable for each and every incision.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:28 | with ink, or with kohl [ keḥol ], or with any substance that marks. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: He is liable only if he writes the name there, as it is stated: “And a tattoo inscription you shall not place upon you, I am the Lord” | Makkot 21a:10 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who imprints a tattoo,</b> by inserting a dye into recesses carved in the skin, is also liable to receive lashes. If <b>one imprinted</b> on the skin with a dye <b>but did not carve</b> the skin, or if <b>one carved</b> the skin <b>but did not imprint</b> the tattoo by adding a dye, <b>he is not liable;</b> he is not liable <b>until he imprints and carves</b> the skin, <b>with ink, or with kohl [<i>keḥol</i>], or with any substance that marks. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: He is liable only if he writes the name there, as it is stated: “And a tattoo inscription you shall not place upon you, I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:28). |
| Leviticus 19:29 | the verse states: “Do not profane your daughter by causing her to act licentiously [ lehaznotah ], | Sanhedrin 76a:22 | <b>But according to</b> that <b>which Rabbi Avin’s father teaches,</b> that the punishment is derived from the verse written with regard to the daughter of a priest, <b>what</b> is the source for the prohibition? <b>Rabbi Ile’a says</b> that the prohibition is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “Do not profane your daughter by causing her to act licentiously [<i>lehaznotah</i>],</b> lest the land falls into licentiousness, and the land becomes full of lewdness” (Leviticus 19:29), from which it is derived that one may not engage in intercourse with his daughter. |
| Leviticus 19:29 | the entire world could become filled with mamzerim . And concerning this, it is stated: “And lest the land become full of lewdness” | Yevamot 37b:3 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to one <b>who engaged in intercourse with</b> and impregnated <b>many women, but he does not know with which</b> women <b>he had intercourse, and similarly,</b> with regard to a woman, if <b>many men had intercourse with her</b> and she became pregnant, <b>but she does not know from which</b> man <b>she received</b> the seed that caused her to become pregnant, since the identities of the parents of those children are not known, <b>it could emerge</b> that <b>a father marries his daughter, and a brother marries his sister. And</b> in this way, <b>the entire world could become filled with <i>mamzerim</i>. And concerning this, it is stated: “And lest the land become full of lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 19:29). Abaye demonstrates his claim from the fact that even though it is not certain that the children in this situation are <i>mamzerim</i>, nevertheless, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov labels them as <i>mamzerim</i> and not as those whose status as a <i>mamzer</i> is uncertain. |
| Leviticus 19:29 | a father marrying his daughter, filling the whole world in its entirety with mamzerim . And concerning this it is stated: “And the land became filled with lewdness” | Yoma 18b:3 | <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A man should not marry a woman in one state and go and marry</b> another <b>woman in a different state, lest</b> a <b>match be arranged</b> between the child of <b>this</b> wife <b>with</b> the child of <b>that</b> wife who are unaware of their relationship. This would <b>lead to a brother marrying his sister</b> or <b>a father marrying his daughter, filling the whole world in its entirety with <i>mamzerim</i>. And concerning this it is stated: “And the land became filled with lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 19:29). The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The Sages generate publicity.</b> Since they were well-known, the identity of their children was also undoubtedly known. Therefore, there was no concern that errors of this kind would befall their children. |
| Leviticus 19:30 | “You shall keep My Shabbatot , and revere My Sanctuary” | Yevamot 6a:12 | The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> And <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“You shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, and revere My Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)? After all, the <i>halakha</i> that the building of the Temple does not override the prohibition against driving an animal on Shabbat is derived from the case of honoring one’s parents. The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary to</b> derive <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person should be in reverence of the Temple</b> and turn the Temple itself into an object of worship. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, and revere My Sanctuary.”</b> The term <b>keeping is stated</b> with regard <b>to Shabbat, and</b> the term <b>reverence is stated</b> with regard <b>to the Temple. Just as</b> in the case of <b>keeping stated</b> with regard <b>to Shabbat,</b> |
| Leviticus 19:30 | the verse states: “You shall keep My Shabbatot and revere My Sanctuary, | Yevamot 6a:7 | <b>Rather,</b> it could <b>enter your mind to say:</b> The principle that a positive mitzva overrides even a prohibition that entails <i>karet</i> is <b>derived from the building of the Temple. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the building of the Temple should override Shabbat;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i> and revere My Sanctuary,</b> I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:30), which means that <b>all of you are obligated in My honor.</b> God is honored when Shabbat is observed, and He demands the observance of Shabbat even when the Temple is being built. |
| Leviticus 19:30 | The verse states: “You shall keep My Shabbatot , and revere My Sanctuary” | Yevamot 6b:3 | <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is obligated to act in this manner <b>when the Temple is standing. From where</b> do I derive that the mitzva to revere the Temple is in force <b>when the Temple is not standing,</b> i.e., that it is prohibited to be disrespectful toward the place where the Temple stood? <b>The verse states: “You shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, and revere My Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 19:30). <b>Just as the keeping stated</b> with regard <b>to Shabbat</b> applies <b>forever, so too, the reverence stated</b> with regard <b>to the Temple is forever.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:31 | that which is written: “Turn you not [ al ] unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits” | Eruvin 17b:11 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan strongly objects: Is one flogged for</b> violating <b>a prohibition that is</b> expressed in the Torah with the negative <b><i>al</i>,</b> rather than the negative <i>lo</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects</b> to the question: <b>If</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> with regard to <b>that which is written: “Turn you not [<i>al</i>] unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits”</b> (Leviticus 19:31), is the <i>halakha</i> there <b>too that one is not flogged?</b> |
| Leviticus 19:31 | were stated in one prohibition: | Keritot 3b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> in tractate <i>Karetot</i> does not count the case of the sorcerer on its own <b>since both</b> the sorcerer and the necromancer <b>were stated in one prohibition:</b> “Do not turn to the necromancers and the sorcerers” (Leviticus 19:31); therefore, there is no separate obligation to bring an offering for each of them. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer and let him not say</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> rather than the reverse. The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>since the verse opened with</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> it is proper to list that transgression and omit the case of a sorcerer. |
| Leviticus 19:32 | and you shall fear | Kiddushin 32b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes like one who does not see</b> the elder. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Before the hoary head <b>you shall stand</b> and you shall revere the face of an elder, <b>and you shall fear</b> your God” (Leviticus 19:32). <b>With regard to</b> any <b>matter given over to the heart, it is stated: “And you shall fear your God.”</b> This phrase is referring to a situation where it is impossible to prove whether one purposefully made it appear as if he were not aware that he was obligated to perform a mitzva, as only that individual and God know the truth. |
| Leviticus 19:32 | “Before the hoary head you shall stand | Kiddushin 32b:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Before the hoary head you shall stand</b> and you shall revere the face of an elder, and you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 19:32): One <b>might</b> have thought that it is obligatory to stand <b>before a simple [<i>ashmai</i>] elder.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “elder,” and an “elder”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a wise man, as it is stated: “Gather unto Me seventy men of the Elders of Israel,</b> whom you know to be the Elders of the people” (Numbers 11:16). <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: An “elder [<i>zaken</i>]”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>one who has acquired wisdom.</b> He interprets the word <i>zaken</i> as a contraction of the phrase <i>zeh kanna</i>, meaning: This one has acquired. Elsewhere the word <i>kanna</i> is used in reference to wisdom, <b>as it is stated</b> that wisdom says: <b>“The Lord acquired me [<i>kanani</i>] at the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22). |
| Leviticus 19:32 | the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere” | Kiddushin 32b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one must stand before</b> an elder as soon as he sees him, even <b>from a distance.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), which teaches: <b>I said</b> that one is obligated to <b>stand only in a place where there is reverence.</b> If he stands while the elder is still far away, it is not clear that he is doing so in his honor. |
| Leviticus 19:32 | one may close his eyes like one who does not see | Kiddushin 33a:11 | It is taught in the same <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes like one who does not see</b> the elder; therefore, the verse states: “Before the hoary head you shall stand, and you shall revere the face of an elder, and you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 19:32). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are dealing with wicked people</b> who would intentionally act this way to avoid fulfilling a mitzva? |
| Leviticus 19:32 | the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere” | Kiddushin 33a:2 | <b>The Master said</b> previously in the <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should revere him through money,</b> i.e., he is required to give him money in his honor; therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere”</b> (Leviticus 19:32). <b>Just as standing includes no monetary loss, so too, reverence</b> is referring to an action <b>that includes no monetary loss.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>standing include no monetary loss</b> at all? <b>Are we not dealing</b> with a case <b>where he was piercing pearls,</b> a highly remunerative task, <b>and in the meantime he must stand</b> for the elder <b>and</b> thereby <b>neglect his work,</b> which causes him a loss? |
| Leviticus 19:32 | The verse states: “An elder, and you shall fear” | Kiddushin 33b:1 | <b>A Torah scholar is permitted to stand before his teacher only</b> once <b>in the morning and</b> once in the <b>evening, so that</b> the teacher’s <b>honor should not be greater than the honor of Heaven,</b> as one recites the <i>Shema</i>, which is tantamount to greeting God, once in the morning and once in the evening. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from an aforementioned opinion. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an elder should not trouble</b> others to honor him? <b>The verse states: “An elder, and you shall fear”</b> (Leviticus 19:32). The collocation of these words comes to teach that the elder, too, must fear God. |
| Leviticus 19:32 | and you shall fear your God” | Kiddushin 33b:3 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Any Torah scholar who does not stand before his teacher is called wicked, and he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as it is stated: “But it shall not be well for the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before [<i>millifnei</i>] God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:13). <b>This fear</b> mentioned in the verse, <b>I do not know what it is. When</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And you shall revere the face [<i>penei</i>] of an elder, <b>and you shall fear your God”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), one can deduce <b>that this fear</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>standing.</b> Consequently, this verse teaches with regard to one who does not stand that he is called wicked, he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as indicated by the phrase: “It shall not be well.” |
| Leviticus 19:32 | And he includes the righteous converts along with the righteous, as it is stated: “You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the elder” | Megillah 17b:18 | <b>And once the heretics cease to be, the horn,</b> i.e., the glory, <b>of the righteous will be exalted, as it is written: “All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted”</b> (Psalms 75:11). Therefore, after the blessing of the heretics, one says the blessing about the righteous. <b>And he includes the righteous converts along with the righteous, as it is stated: “You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the elder”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), <b>and adjacent to this</b> it is stated: <b>“And if a stranger sojourns with you”</b> (Leviticus 19:33). An “elder” is one with Torah wisdom and a “stranger” is one who has converted to Judaism. |
| Leviticus 19:33 | “And when a convert lives in your land, you shall not mistreat him” | Bava Metzia59b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to verbal <b>mistreatment, that three prohibitions are written</b> concerning it: <b>“And you shall neither mistreat a convert”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And when a convert lives in your land, you shall not mistreat him”</b> (Leviticus 19:33); <b>“And you shall not mistreat, each man his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 25:17), <b>and a convert is</b> included in the category of <b>colleague?</b> With regard to <b>one who also oppresses</b> a convert <b>as well, three</b> prohibitions <b>are written:</b> “And you shall neither mistreat a convert, <b>nor oppress him”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And you shall not oppress a convert</b> (Exodus 23:9); <b>“And you shall not be to him like a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24). This last prohibition is a general prohibition, <b>in which converts are included.</b> Consequently, it is not correct that one who oppresses a convert violates only two prohibitions. <b>Rather, both this</b> one, who verbally mistreats a convert, <b>and that</b> one, who oppresses him, <b>violate three prohibitions.</b> |
| Leviticus 19:33 | “And if a stranger sojourns with you” | Megillah 17b:18 | <b>And once the heretics cease to be, the horn,</b> i.e., the glory, <b>of the righteous will be exalted, as it is written: “All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted”</b> (Psalms 75:11). Therefore, after the blessing of the heretics, one says the blessing about the righteous. <b>And he includes the righteous converts along with the righteous, as it is stated: “You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the elder”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), <b>and adjacent to this</b> it is stated: <b>“And if a stranger sojourns with you”</b> (Leviticus 19:33). An “elder” is one with Torah wisdom and a “stranger” is one who has converted to Judaism. |
| Leviticus 19:33 | with you | Yevamot 46b:17 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>someone who came and said: I am a convert,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we should accept him;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a convert sojourns <b>with you</b> in your land, you shall not oppress him” (Leviticus 19:33). The emphasis on “with you” suggests that only someone who was already <b>presumed by you</b> to be a valid convert should be accepted as a convert. If <b>he came and</b> brought <b>witnesses</b> to his conversion <b>with him, from where</b> is it derived that he is to be accepted? It is from <b>the</b> beginning of that <b>verse,</b> which <b>states: “And if a convert sojourns with you in your land.”</b> |
| Leviticus 19:33 | land” | Yevamot 47a:3 | As cited above, the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> states: “With you <b>in</b> your <b>land”</b> (Leviticus 19:33). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a convert is accepted <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael; <b>from where</b> do I derive that also <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael he is to be accepted? <b>The verse states: “With you,”</b> which indicates that <b>in any place that he is with you,</b> you should accept him. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>expound that</b> phrase in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> to teach that one doesn’t accept the claims of an individual that he is a valid convert? The Gemara explains: <b>One</b> of these <i>halakhot</i> is derived from the phrase <b>“with you”</b> in the verse cited, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> is derived from the phrase <b>“with you”</b> in a subsequent verse (Leviticus 25:35). |
| Leviticus 19:35 | The Sages taught: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure [ bammidda ], in weight, or in measure [ uvamesura ]” | Bava Batra89b:8 | § The Gemara further discusses weights and measures. <b>The Sages taught: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure [<i>bammidda</i>], in weight, or in measure [<i>uvamesura</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:35). The <i>baraita</i> defines these terms: <b>“In measure [<i>bammidda</i>],” this</b> is referring to <b>measuring land,</b> teaching <b>that</b> in order to measure land in a just manner <b>one may not measure for one</b> person <b>in the summer</b> when the measuring rope has become dry and short, <b>and for one</b> other individual <b>in the rainy season,</b> when the measuring rope is wet and limp, and therefore stretches more. <b>“In weight”</b> means <b>that one may not cover his weights in salt,</b> as salt erodes the weights, causing a loss for the buyer. <b>“Or in measure [<i>bamesura</i>]”</b> means <b>that one may not cause</b> liquid he is measuring <b>to foam</b> by pouring it speedily, as this results in a loss for the buyer, who receives less of the liquid than the amount for which he paid. |
| Leviticus 19:35 | prohibition that the Merciful One wrote with regard to weights: | Bava Metzia61b:3 | <b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: Why do I</b> need the <b>prohibition that the Merciful One wrote with regard to weights:</b> “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in volume” (Leviticus 19:35)? It is merely another form of robbery. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> It is referring <b>to</b> a seller who <b>buries his weights in salt,</b> in order to lighten them. Rav Yeimar said: <b>That is</b> the same as <b>full-fledged robbery;</b> therefore, it should not require a separate derivation. Rav Ashi answered: It is written <b>to</b> establish that he <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>from the moment of the act</b> of burying them. He violates the prohibition even before he actually deceives a buyer with the buried weights. |
| Leviticus 19:35 | The Sages taught: The verse states: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in volume [ uvamesura ]” | Bava Metzia61b:4 | <b>The Sages taught: The verse states: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in volume [<i>uvamesura</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:35). <b>“In measure”; this</b> is referring to the <b>measurement of land,</b> e.g., this means <b>that</b> in a case where two people are dividing their jointly owned field, <b>one may not measure</b> the land to be given <b>to one during the summer and</b> measure the land to be given <b>to the other during the rainy season,</b> because the length of the measuring cord is affected by the weather conditions. <b>“In weight”; this</b> is referring <b>to</b> the fact that <b>he may not bury his measuring weights in salt. And “in volume”;</b> this teaches <b>that one may not froth</b> the liquid one is selling, creating the impression that there is more liquid in the vessel than there actually is. |
| Leviticus 19:36 | a just hin , | Bava Metzia49a:6 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “A just ephah, and <b>a just <i>hin</i>,</b> shall you have” (Leviticus 19:36)? <b>But wasn’t a <i>hin</i> included in an ephah?</b> Why is it necessary to state both? <b>Rather,</b> this is an allusion that serves <b>to say to you that your yes [<i>hen</i>]</b> should be <b>just, and your no</b> should be <b>just.</b> Apparently, it is a mitzva for one to fulfill his promises. <b>Abaye says: That</b> verse means <b>that one should not say one</b> matter <b>with</b> his <b>mouth and</b> think <b>one</b> other matter <b>in</b> his <b>heart.</b> It is prohibited for one to make a commitment that he has no intention of fulfilling. Rav Kahana made his commitment in good faith and reneged due to changed circumstances. That is not prohibited. |
| Leviticus 19:36 | “Just balances, just weights | Sanhedrin 39a:1 | And they are the parables concerning the following verses: <b>“The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge”</b> (Ezekiel 18:2); <b>“Just balances, just weights</b>…shall you have” (Leviticus 19:36); and <b>“The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead”</b> (Proverbs 11:8). |
| Leviticus 20:2 | “Any man [ ish , ish ] who gives of his seed to the Molekh ” | Chagigah 11b:11 | They ask: <b>If that is so,</b> then what of <b>this verse: “Any man [<i>ish</i>, <i>ish</i>] who curses his God”</b> (Leviticus 24:15), or <b>“Any man [<i>ish</i>, <i>ish</i>] who gives of his seed to the <i>Molekh</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:2), which is a form of idol worship? In both cases the double expression implies the number two. <b>So too</b> there, will you say that it is prohibited to teach these <i>halakhot</i> before two individuals? |
| Leviticus 20:3 | with regard to idol worship? | Sanhedrin 64b:17 | § <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Why</b> is the punishment of <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]</b> mentioned <b>three</b> times <b>with regard to idol worship?</b> It is stated twice with regard to the ritual of Molekh, in the verse: “I will also set My face against that man, and I will excise him from among his people” (Leviticus 20:3), and in the verse: “Then I will set My face against that man, and against his family, and I will excise him” (Leviticus 20:5). The third mention of <i>karet</i> is with regard to one who blasphemes: “That person blasphemes the Lord, and that soul shall be excised from among his people” (Numbers 15:30). |
| Leviticus 20:3 | the verse state: “Because he has given of his offspring to Molekh” | Sanhedrin 64b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Because he has given of his offspring to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 20:3)? What is added by this statement? <b>Because it is stated: “There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is prohibited for one to pass <b>his son or daughter. From where</b> do I derive that one who passes <b>his son’s son or his daughter’s son</b> is also liable? <b>The verse states: “When he gives of his offspring”</b> (Leviticus 20:4). The term “offspring” indicates that grandchildren are included. This resolves one of Rav Ashi’s dilemmas. |
| Leviticus 20:3 | in order to render impure My Sanctuary” | Shevuot 7b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that each of these sins is referred to as impurity: <b>With regard to idol worship</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “For he had given his offspring to Molekh <b>in order to render impure My Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 20:3). <b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations</b> the verse <b>states: “You shall safeguard My charge not to do any of the abominable traditions</b> that were done before you <b>and not to render yourself impure through them”</b> (Leviticus 18:30). <b>With regard to bloodshed</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “The land will not atone for the blood that was spilled on it except through the blood of the one who spilled it; <b>you shall not render the land impure”</b> (Numbers 35:34). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the goat</b> offering <b>would atone for these three</b> types of <b>impurities.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “From the impurities of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities <b>but not</b> for <b>all impurities.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:4 | The verse states: “When he gives of his offspring” | Sanhedrin 64b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Because he has given of his offspring to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 20:3)? What is added by this statement? <b>Because it is stated: “There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is prohibited for one to pass <b>his son or daughter. From where</b> do I derive that one who passes <b>his son’s son or his daughter’s son</b> is also liable? <b>The verse states: “When he gives of his offspring”</b> (Leviticus 20:4). The term “offspring” indicates that grandchildren are included. This resolves one of Rav Ashi’s dilemmas. |
| Leviticus 20:5 | “Then I will set My face against that man, and against his family, | Shevuot 39a:19 | <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the Torah with regard to one who worships Molech: <b>“Then I will set My face against that man, and against his family,</b> and I will cut him off” (Leviticus 20:5)? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he sinned, how did his family sin?</b> Why are they punished? This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is no family that has</b> an unauthorized <b>tax collector among them</b> in <b>which all of</b> the family members <b>are not</b> regarded as unauthorized <b>tax collectors, and</b> similarly, there is no family <b>that has a bandit [<i>listim</i>] among them</b> in <b>which all of</b> the family members <b>are not</b> regarded as <b>bandits.</b> This is <b>because they cover for him.</b> Evidently, punishment is exacted from the transgressor’s family with regard to transgressions other than taking a false oath. |
| Leviticus 20:9 | “A man who curses his father and his mother | Bava Metzia94b:24 | The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“A man who curses his father and his mother</b> shall die” (Leviticus 20:9), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable if he curses both <b>his father and his mother. From where</b> do I derive that if one curses <b>his father but not his mother,</b> or <b>his mother but not his father,</b> that he is liable? The continuation of <b>the verse states: “His father and his mother he has cursed,</b> his blood is upon him.” In the first part of the verse, the word “curses” is in proximity to “his father,” and in the last part of the verse, it is in proximity to “his mother.” This teaches that the verse is referring to both a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his father</b> and a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his mother;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:9 | “A man who curses his father and his mother | Chullin 78b:5 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“A man who curses his father and his mother</b> shall die” (Leviticus 20:9), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable if he curses both <b>his father and his mother. From where</b> do I derive that if one curses <b>his father but not his mother,</b> or <b>his mother but not his father,</b> he is liable? The continuation of <b>the verse states: “His father and his mother he has cursed,</b> his blood is upon him.” In the first part of the verse, the word “curses” is in proximity to “his father,” and in the last part of the verse, “cursed” is in proximity to “his mother.” This teaches that the verse is referring to both a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his father</b> and a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his mother;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Rabbi Yoshiya maintains that conjunctions are interpreted strictly unless the verse indicates otherwise. |
| Leviticus 20:9 | The Sages taught: | Sanhedrin 66a:8 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse (Leviticus 20:9) could have stated merely: For <b>a man [<i>ish</i>]</b> that curses his father and his mother shall be put to death; he has cursed his father and his mother; his blood shall be upon him. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “For <b>any man [<i>ish ish</i>],”</b> repeating the term <i>ish</i>? It is <b>to include</b> not only a son, but also <b>a daughter, one whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>], and a hermaphrodite [<i>ve’androginos</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 20:9 | he has cursed his father and his mother; | Sanhedrin 85b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “For any man who curses his father and his mother shall die; <b>he has cursed his father and his mother;</b> his blood shall be upon him” (Leviticus 20:9). This is referring to one who curses his parents even <b>after</b> their <b>death, as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Since one is liable for striking and one is liable for cursing, just as one who strikes is liable only when</b> his father or mother are <b>alive, so too, one who curses is liable only when</b> they are <b>alive.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:9 | “A man who curses his father and his mother | Shevuot 27a:15 | The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“A man who curses his father and his mother</b> shall die” (Leviticus 20:9), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable if he curses both <b>his father and his mother.

The continuation of <b>the verse states: “His father and his mother he has cursed;</b> his blood is upon him.” In the first part of the verse, the word “curses” is in proximity to “his father,” and in the last part of the verse, “cursed” is in proximity to “his mother.” This teaches that the verse is referring to both a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his father</b> and a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his mother;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Rabbi Yoshiya maintains that conjunctions are interpreted strictly unless the verse indicates otherwise. |
| Leviticus 20:9 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: Blessing is stated below | Yevamot 101a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who exempts</b> the son from punishment? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Blessing is stated below</b> (Leviticus 20:9), with regard to cursing parents, <b>and blessing is stated above</b> (Exodus 22:27), with regard to cursing God. The Sages used the word blessing as a euphemism for cursing, as it was their custom to avoid uncouth language. <b>Just as</b> the statement <b>above,</b> in Exodus, is referring to a curse <b>that does not involve partnership,</b> as God is One, <b>so too</b> the statement <b>below,</b> in Leviticus, is referring exclusively to a curse of a parent <b>that does not involve partnership,</b> i.e., when there is no doubt with regard to his identity. <b>And striking is juxtaposed with cursing.</b> Just as one is not liable for cursing when it is unclear who his father is, the same applies to striking. |
| Leviticus 20:10 | hear | Kiddushin 19a:4 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from the verse: “And the man who commits adultery with the wife of another man, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death” (Leviticus 20:10). The Sages expounded that the term <b>“man”</b> serves <b>to exclude a minor</b> who commits adultery. The phrase <b>“who commits adultery with the wife of another man”</b> serves <b>to exclude the wife of a minor,</b> as the marriage of a minor is invalid. <b>And if you say</b> that a father can <b>designate</b> a wife for his minor son, and designation effects betrothal or marriage, <b>we find</b> that there is <b>marriage for a minor.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:10 | with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 51b:10 | <b>Do you say</b> that it is referring only <b>to a young woman who is betrothed, or</b> that <b>it is</b> referring <b>even</b> to <b>a married woman? The verse states:</b> “And <b>a man who commits adultery</b> with another man’s wife, he who commits adultery <b>with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 20:10). <b>All</b> adulterers <b>were included in</b> the category of: <b>“The adulterer and the adulteress,”</b> and were executed by strangulation, until <b>the verse singled out the</b> betrothed <b>daughter of a non-priest</b> for execution <b>by stoning and the daughter of a priest</b> for execution <b>by burning.</b> It is therefore derived that <b>just as when the verse singles out the daughter of a non-priest for stoning</b> the Torah states that the reference is to a woman who is <b>betrothed and not married, so too, when the verse singles out the daughter of a priest for burning</b> it is referring to a woman who is <b>betrothed and not married.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:10 | The Sages taught: | Sanhedrin 52b:22 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, even he who commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:10). The term: <b>“A man,”</b> is interpreted as <b>excluding a minor boy</b> who committed adultery before he came of age. The phrase: <b>“Who commits adultery with another man’s wife,”</b> is interpreted as <b>excluding the wife of a minor boy;</b> marriage to a minor is not considered halakhic marriage. <b>“His neighbor’s wife” excludes the wife of another,</b> i.e., a gentile, who is not referred to as “his neighbor.” |
| Leviticus 20:10 | a difficulty according to | Sanhedrin 53a:9 | <b>If we say</b> that the case of adultery of <b>a married woman</b> would pose <b>a difficulty according to</b> Rabbi Zeira, as it is stated: “The adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:10), and therefore perhaps <b>we should derive and learn from</b> the phrase “they <b>shall be put to death”</b> stated with regard to <b>a necromancer and a sorcerer</b> that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer, they are executed <b>by stoning, so too here,</b> with regard to adultery, the transgressors should be executed <b>by stoning,</b> this does not pose a difficulty. |
| Leviticus 20:11 | by means of a verbal analogy | Sanhedrin 53b:15 | <b>Rather, Rava says</b> that there is an alternative source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that concerning the meaning of the phrase <b>“the nakedness of your father,” this is</b> referring to <b>your father’s wife. And he derives</b> this interpretation <b>by means of a verbal analogy</b> from the verse: “And the man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:11). |
| Leviticus 20:11 | of Rava: | Sanhedrin 54a:1 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava:</b> With regard to the verse: “And the man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall be put to death, their blood shall be upon them” (Leviticus 20:11), the term: <b>“The man,” excludes a minor.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:11 | he has uncovered his father’s nakedness” | Sanhedrin 54a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that the reference is to <b>your father’s wife, or is it rather</b> referring to <b>the nakedness of your father literally,</b> i.e., to homosexual intercourse with one’s father? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here: “The nakedness of your father…you shall not uncover,” and it is stated there,</b> in the verse that describes the punishment: “And the man who lies with his father’s wife, <b>he has uncovered his father’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:11). <b>Just as there, the verse is speaking of marriage,</b> i.e., it is not referring to the father himself but to his wife, <b>so too here, the verse is speaking of marriage,</b> i.e., his father’s wife. |
| Leviticus 20:11 | “He has uncovered his father’s nakedness” | Sanhedrin 54a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> answers, expounding on the verbal analogy it mentioned earlier: <b>It is stated here,</b> in the verse that describes the prohibition: <b>“The nakedness of your father…you shall not uncover”</b> (Leviticus 18:7), <b>and it is stated there,</b> in the verse that describes the punishment: <b>“He has uncovered his father’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:11). It is derived from this verbal analogy that <b>just as with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition, the verse renders his mother who is not his father’s wife like his mother who is his father’s wife,</b> i.e., both are forbidden, <b>so too, with regard to</b> the <b>punishment, the verse renders his mother who is not his father’s wife like his mother who is his father’s wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:13 | “Cohabitations of a woman” | Gittin 85a:21 | Rava raised another dilemma: If he says to her that she is permitted to any man <b>except for</b> engaging in <b>intercourse in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to typical</b> sexual intercourse <b>he did not leave out</b> part of the divorce, rendering the divorce valid? <b>Or perhaps</b> from the fact that the expression: <b>“Cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 20:13), <b>is written</b> in the plural, it is derived that typical and atypical sexual intercourse have the same status, and accordingly this is considered a partial divorce, and it will not take effect. |
| Leviticus 20:13 | as the Sages taught | Sanhedrin 54a:29 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive the prohibition and punishment for homosexual intercourse with <b>a male?</b> It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood shall be upon them” (Leviticus 20:13): The word <b>“man” excludes a minor boy.</b> The phrase <b>“lies with a male”</b> is referring to any male, <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult man</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor boy.</b> The phrase <b>“as with a woman [<i>mishkevei isha</i>],”</b> referring to lying with a woman, appears in the plural. <b>The verse teaches you that</b> there are <b>two</b> manners of <b>lying with a woman</b> for which one who engages in intercourse with a woman forbidden to him is punished, vaginal and anal intercourse. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “lewdness” | Chagigah 11b:3 | Furthermore, the punishment for this transgression is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between: “It is <b>lewdness</b> [<b><i>zima</i></b>]” (Leviticus 18:17), which is written with regard to a woman and her daughter, and the same term <b>“lewdness”</b> that appears elsewhere, as it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness [<i>zima</i>]: They shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 20:14 | burning. | Keritot 5a:16 | Furthermore, the punishment for this transgression of intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between: “It is <b>lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), which is written with regard to engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same term <b>“lewdness”</b> that appears elsewhere, which teaches that the transgressor is liable <b>to</b> be put to death by <b>burning.</b> As it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). This teaches that death by burning is the punishment for engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same applies to intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped, due to the verbal analogy of <i>henna</i> and <i>henna</i> linking the two cases. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “lewdness” | Sanhedrin 51a:12 | Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, so that there be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who engages in intercourse with his daughter or granddaughter is liable to be executed by burning. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | if a man takes a woman and her mother, | Sanhedrin 75a:15 | § The mishna enumerates several women with whom intercourse is forbidden who are included in the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with a woman and her daughter, which is punished by execution by burning. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived <b>as the Sages taught:</b> “And <b>if a man takes a woman and her mother,</b> it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this punishment applies to one who engages in intercourse with <b>a woman and</b> with <b>her mother. From where</b> is it derived that one who engages in intercourse with <b>the daughter of</b> the <b>woman</b> married to him, <b>or</b> with <b>the daughter of her daughter, or</b> with <b>the daughter of her son,</b> is also liable to be executed by burning? |
| Leviticus 20:14 | Lewdness is stated here, | Sanhedrin 75a:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Lewdness is stated here,</b> with regard to the punishment: “There shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), <b>and lewdness is stated there,</b> with regard to the prohibition: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen, it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). It is derived by means of a verbal analogy that <b>just as there</b> the prohibition applies to the woman’s <b>daughter, and the daughter of her daughter, and the daughter of her son, so too here,</b> the punishment of burning applies to one who engages in intercourse with the woman’s <b>daughter, and</b> to <b>the daughter of her daughter, and</b> to <b>the daughter of her son.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “lewdness” | Sanhedrin 75b:2 | <b>Rava says: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> The equation of his relative to her relative is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to his relative: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not expose; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to her relative: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). Additionally, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 20:14 | above, | Sanhedrin 75b:6 | <b>Abaye says: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: From where</b> is it derived <b>to render</b> the status of a relative for <b>three generations above,</b> his wife, his mother-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law, <b>like</b> the status of a relative for <b>three generations below,</b> his wife, his daughter, and the daughter of his daughter? <b>Lewdness is stated</b> with regard to relatives <b>below,</b> the offspring of his wife (Leviticus 18:17), <b>and lewdness is stated</b> with regard to relatives <b>above,</b> the ancestors of his wife (Leviticus 20:14). <b>Just as</b> with regard to relatives <b>below,</b> one is liable for engaging in intercourse with <b>three generations</b> of women, <b>so too</b> with regard to relatives <b>above,</b> one is liable for engaging in intercourse with <b>three generations</b> of women. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “lewdness” | Sanhedrin 76a:16 | <b>Rava says: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter who is not the daughter of his wife <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>henna</i>,”</b> written with regard to his descendants: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b>“<i>henna</i>”</b> written with regard to the descendants of his wife: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). Then, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). |
| Leviticus 20:14 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 76b:5 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14). What is the meaning of <b>“both him and them”?</b> It means <b>him and one of them,</b> as one woman is his wife. He is liable for engaging in intercourse with the other woman; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It means <b>him and the two of them.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “lewdness” | Sanhedrin 87b:3 | Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, so that there be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who engages in sexual intercourse with his daughter or granddaughter is liable to be executed by burning. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | burning is written with regard to his mother-in-law, | Yevamot 2b:11 | However, the Gemara argues that even so, the order of the mishna remains problematic. <b>If so, let him teach</b> the case of <b>one’s mother-in-law first, as the main</b> transgression that entails <b>burning is written with regard to his mother-in-law,</b> as it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). <b>And furthermore, after his mother-in-law let him teach his daughter-in-law, as after</b> execution by <b>burning, stoning is the most severe</b> of the other capital punishments imposed by the courts. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “wickedness” | Yevamot 3a:3 | Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“wickedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“wickedness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who has sexual intercourse with a daughter from a rape is liable to burning. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | “They shall be burned in fire, he and they [ et’hen ]” | Yevamot 94b:9 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states, with regard to one who takes a woman and her daughter: <b>“They shall be burned in fire, he and they [<i>et’hen</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 20:14). Now this cannot literally mean that both women are burned, as the first woman he took did not sin at all. The Sages therefore explained that the word <i>et’hen</i> <b>means he and one of them [<i>mehen</i>].</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: He and both of them.</b> Since it is hard to understand how they could both deserve punishment, the <i>amora’im</i> suggested various interpretations of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion. |
| Leviticus 20:14 | As it is written: “They shall be burned in fire, he and they” | Yevamot 95a:7 | <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that one who has intercourse with his mother-in-law is forbidden to his wife? <b>As it is written: “They shall be burned in fire, he and they”</b> (Leviticus 20:14). This verse is puzzling: <b>And shall the entire house be</b> punished by <b>burning?</b> Why should both women be punished when only one of them transgressed? <b>If it does not</b> refer to <b>the matter</b> of <b>burning, refer it to</b> the matter of <b>a prohibition,</b> that they are both forbidden to him. This teaches that he is forbidden not only to the woman with whom he sinned, but also to his wife. |
| Leviticus 20:15 | lie with | Sanhedrin 15a:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of the one who</b> actively <b>lies</b> with the animal, i.e., a male who sexually penetrates the animal, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of the one who</b> causes the animal to <b>lie with</b> him, by being penetrated by the animal. There is another verse (Leviticus 20:15) that explicitly addresses a man penetrating the animal sexually; this verse from Exodus is therefore understood to be referring to the case where he causes the animal to penetrate him. <b>And the Merciful One brought</b> this <b>forth</b> using <b>the</b> active <b>term “lies,” to compare one who</b> causes the animal to <b>lie with</b> him <b>to one who</b> actively <b>lies</b> with the animal, in order to teach that <b>just as</b> in a case of <b>one who lies</b> with an animal, <b>he and his animal are</b> to be judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b>one who</b> causes an animal to <b>lie with</b> him, <b>he and his animal</b> are to be judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. |
| Leviticus 20:15 | and you shall kill the animal” | Sanhedrin 2a:9 | § Cases of <b>capital law</b> are judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>An animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality</b> are judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if a woman approaches any animal to lie with it, <b>you shall kill the woman and the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:16), <b>and it states:</b> “And if a man lies with an animal, he shall be put to death <b>and you shall kill the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:15). In cases of bestiality, the verse juxtaposes the execution of the animal to the execution of the person, and therefore the case of the animal is adjudicated in the same way as cases of capital law. |
| Leviticus 20:15 | as the Sages taught: | Sanhedrin 54b:4 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one who engages in intercourse with <b>an animal</b> is liable to receive capital punishment? It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> “And if a man lies with an animal, he shall be put to death, and you shall kill the animal” (Leviticus 20:15). The word <b>“man” excludes a minor boy.</b> The phrase <b>“lies with an animal”</b> is referring to any animal, <b>whether old or young.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:16 | you shall kill the woman and the animal” | Sanhedrin 15a:13 | § The mishna teaches that cases of <b>capital law</b> are judged by twenty-three judges, and that an animal that copulated with a person is also judged by twenty-three judges. The Gemara comments: The mishna <b>categorically teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, indicating that <b>there is no difference</b> if this was an ox <b>that copulated with a male, and there is no difference</b> if it was an ox <b>that copulated with a female.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the source for this <i>halakha</i> is clear in the case where <b>it copulated with a female, as it is written</b> explicitly: “And if a woman approaches any animal and lies down with it, <b>you shall kill the woman and the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:16). <b>But</b> with regard to an ox <b>that copulated with a male, from where do we</b> derive that the animal is to be killed? |
| Leviticus 20:16 | you shall kill the woman and the animal” | Sanhedrin 2a:9 | § Cases of <b>capital law</b> are judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>An animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality</b> are judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if a woman approaches any animal to lie with it, <b>you shall kill the woman and the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:16), <b>and it states:</b> “And if a man lies with an animal, he shall be put to death <b>and you shall kill the animal”</b> (Leviticus 20:15). In cases of bestiality, the verse juxtaposes the execution of the animal to the execution of the person, and therefore the case of the animal is adjudicated in the same way as cases of capital law. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” | Keritot 15a:13 | <b>Rather,</b> the reason one is liable to bring three separate sin offerings for engaging in intercourse with his sister who is also the sister of his mother and the sister of his father is that <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man takes his sister…and they shall be cut off [<i>venikhretu</i>] in the sight of the children of their people; <b>he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:17). The final clause in this verse serves <b>to render him liable</b> to receive three separate penalties of <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> intentional intercourse, or to bring three separate sin offerings for unwitting intercourse, with <b>his sister who is</b> also <b>the sister of his father</b> and <b>who is the sister of his mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:17 | singled out | Keritot 2b:19 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b><i>karet</i></b> which one incurs for engaging in intercourse <b>with one’s sister</b> is <b>singled out</b> and mentioned independently of the other acts of forbidden intercourse (Leviticus 20:17). This serves <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions and teach that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each individual prohibition against forbidden intercourse. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | from the latter clause of the verse, as it is written: “He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” | Keritot 2b:31 | The Gemara turns its attention to the other opinion: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, from where does he</b> derive <b>this matter?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from the latter clause of the verse, as it is written: “He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:17). This seemingly superfluous phrase teaches this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | karet that the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s sister, | Keritot 3a:4 | The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But</b> accordingly, <b>once</b> there are <b>separate prohibitions</b> stated in the Torah with regard to engaging in intercourse with all forbidden relatives (Leviticus, chapter 18), and at the conclusion of that passage it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), it is indicated that the punishments of <i>karet</i> or a sin offering apply to all these prohibitions. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s sister,</b> in a separate passage: “And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:17)? |
| Leviticus 20:17 | in the first clause | Keritot 3a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: One can say <b>that they derive it from</b> the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the first clause</b> of the verse: “And if a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak holds</b> that one cannot derive a <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the first clause,</b> as <b>it is the manner of the verse</b> to describe the case in detail before stating the prohibition that applies to it. <b>And</b> therefore <b>he derives from</b> the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the latter clause</b> of the verse that this comes <b>to separate</b> between the prohibitions and render one liable to bring three separate sin offerings for engaging in intercourse <b>with his</b> own <b>sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:17 | before the eyes of [ le’einei ] | Makkot 13b:12 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: The Torah explicitly included with regard to lashes those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, as is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy: “And they shall be excised [<i>venikhretu</i>] <b>before the eyes of [<i>le’einei</i>]</b> the children of their people” (Leviticus 20:17), <b>from:</b> “Forty he shall flog him…and your brother shall be dishonored <b>before your eyes [<i>le’einekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3). <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel objects to this: If so,</b> the inclusion of <b>those liable to</b> be executed with <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties <b>should also be learned</b> by means of a verbal analogy: “If <b>from the eyes of [<i>me’einei</i>]</b> the assembly it was performed unwittingly” (Numbers 15:24) stated with regard to idol worship, for which one is liable to be executed, <b>from: “Before your eyes,”</b> stated with regard to lashes. On that basis, one should derive that those liable to be executed with a court-imposed death penalty should also be flogged. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | one’s sister emerge | Makkot 13b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that like those liable to be executed, those liable to receive <i>karet</i> are not flogged. <b>Those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for incest <b>were</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>generalization:</b> “For anyone who performs any of these abominations, the souls who do so shall be excised [<i>venikhretu</i>] from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). Included in that category is one who engages in intercourse with his sister. <b>And why</b> then did the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>karet</i> with regard to</b> intercourse with <b>one’s sister emerge</b> from the generalization and receive specific mention: “And a man who takes his sister…and they shall be excised before the eyes of the children of their people” (Leviticus 20:17)? It is in order <b>to sentence one</b> who engages in intercourse with his sister <b>with <i>karet</i>, and not with lashes.</b> This is the source for the opinion that those liable to receive <i>karet</i> are not flogged. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | in the latter clause | Makkot 14a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to the other</b> opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>too, this is certainly a refuted <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, from which no <i>halakha</i> can be derived. <b>Rather,</b> as for the <i>halakha</i> that a person is liable to bring three sin-offerings for engaging in intercourse with his sister who is also his father’s sister and who is also his mother’s sister, Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>derives it from</b> the phrase <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the latter clause</b> of that verse. The verse begins: “And a man who takes his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother…and they shall be excised…the nakedness of his sister he has revealed, he shall bear his transgression” (Leviticus 20:17). From the repetition of the term sister, it is derived that he is liable to bring a sin-offering for each and every prohibition that he violated. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | with his sister, excluded | Makkot 14a:2 | § It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For anyone who performs any of these abominations, the souls who do so shall be excised from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> when administered to one who engages in intercourse <b>with his sister, excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence him</b> to be punished <b>with <i>karet</i> and not to</b> be punished <b>with lashes.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:17 | “his sister” at the beginning | Makkot 14b:1 | <b>from</b> the term <b>“his sister” at the beginning</b> of the verse (Leviticus 20:17), as the verse could have been formulated: And a man who takes the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother, and there is no need to mention a sister at all. Liability for intercourse with a woman who is the daughter of both his father and his mother is derived from the term “his sister.” |
| Leviticus 20:17 | one’s sister excluded | Makkot 23b:5 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> There is no proof from here that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who says: There are no lashes in</b> cases of <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of forbidden relations <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the people who commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> in the case of relations with <b>one’s sister excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence</b> one who transgresses a prohibition punishable with <i>karet</i> <b>to</b> be punished <b>with <i>karet</i></b> alone, <b>and not with lashes.</b> Other Sages disagree with Rabbi Yitzḥak (see 13b). |
| Leviticus 20:17 | “A man who takes his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother” | Makkot 5b:11 | <b>He said to</b> his father: <b>You have taught us, our teacher, that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference.</b> The punishment must be stated in the Torah. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that among the relatives with whom engaging in intercourse is forbidden it states: <b>“A man who takes his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother”</b> (Leviticus 20:17): <b>I have</b> derived <b>only the daughter of his father who is not the daughter of his mother, or the daughter of his mother who is not the daughter of his father. From where</b> is it derived that one is liable for engaging in intercourse with his sister who is both <b>the daughter of his mother and the daughter of his father?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “He has uncovered the nakedness of his sister”</b> (Leviticus 20:17), indicating that one is liable for engaging in intercourse with any sister. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | We heard | Makkot 5b:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We heard</b> from that verse (Leviticus 20:17) the <b>punishment</b> for engaging in intercourse with one’s sister with whom he has both parents in common. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against engaging in those acts of intercourse derived? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother…</b>you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:9). <b>I have</b> derived the prohibition against engaging in intercourse <b>only</b> with <b>the daughter of his father who is not the daughter of his mother, or</b> with <b>the daughter of his mother who is not the daughter of his father. From where</b> do I derive a prohibition against engaging in intercourse with his sister who is both <b>the daughter of his father and the daughter of his mother?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife, born of your father; she is your sister”</b> (Leviticus 18:11), indicating that engaging in intercourse with any sister is prohibited. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | one’s sister excluded | Megillah 7b:21 | <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> There is no proof from here that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said: There are no lashes in</b> cases of <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the persons that commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> administered to <b>one’s sister excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence her to</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> and not to</b> the punishment of <b>lashes.</b> This serves as a paradigm; wherever one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, there are no lashes. |
| Leviticus 20:17 | As it is stated: “And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness | Sanhedrin 40b:21 | <b>Ulla says: From where in the Torah</b> is the obligation <b>of forewarning</b> derived? <b>As it is stated: “And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness</b> and she see his nakedness, it is a disgraceful deed and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people” (Leviticus 20:17). One can ask: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>the matter is dependent on sight?</b> The transgression is engaging in sexual intercourse, not seeing each other. <b>Rather,</b> the meaning of “and see” is: He is not liable <b>until he sees the reason of the matter,</b> that it should be clear to him that he is committing a transgression by having been forewarned. <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is not needed for the matter of excision [<i>karet</i>],</b> as this punishment is in the hands of Heaven, and God is aware whether or not he acted intentionally, |
| Leviticus 20:17 | “his sister” | Sanhedrin 41a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to have all of these sources, <b>since if the Merciful One</b> would <b>write</b> the requirement of forewarning in the context of <b>“his sister”</b> (Leviticus 20:17) alone, <b>I would say: Those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, yes,</b> they do require forewarning, but <b>those liable</b> to receive court-imposed <b>capital punishments,</b> whose transgressions are severe, do <b>not</b> require forewarning. Therefore <b>the Merciful One writes,</b> with regard to a murderer: <b>“If</b> a man <b>come intentionally.”</b> |
| Leviticus 20:17 | taking. | Yevamot 55a:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the initial stage of intercourse</b> is considered an act of sexual intercourse <b>with regard to those liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for</b> violating <b>prohibitions</b> specific to <b>the priesthood?</b> Since these prohibitions are unique in that they apply only to priests, their parameters cannot be derived from prohibitions that apply to the entire population. The Gemara answers: It <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the words <b>taking</b> and <b>taking.</b> This verb appears in prohibitions punishable by <i>karet</i>, e.g., “And if a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17), and in prohibitions of the priesthood, where it states: “They shall not take a woman that is a harlot” (Leviticus 21:7). |
| Leviticus 20:17 | it is written: “And if a man takes his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter” | Yevamot 97a:13 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: However, if</b> that interpretation is <b>so,</b> then <b>with regard to</b> intercourse with <b>one’s sister,</b> concerning whom <b>it is written: “And if a man takes his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter”</b> (Leviticus 20:17), you must <b>also</b> say that is it is only intercourse <b>through taking,</b> i.e., marriage, that is <b>prohibited.</b> But intercourse <b>through lying,</b> i.e., without marriage, is <b>permitted.</b> How can this be? |
| Leviticus 20:18 | That halakha is also written: “He has uncovered [ he’era ] her fount” | Horayot 4a:14 | The Gemara answers: The judges did not issue an erroneous ruling with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who observes a day for a day. Rather, the mishna is discussing a case <b>where they said: The initial stage of intercourse [<i>ha’ara’a</i>]</b> is <b>permitted</b> with a menstruating woman; <b>it is the completion of</b> the act of <b>intercourse that is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>That <i>halakha</i> is also written: “He has uncovered [<i>he’era</i>] her fount”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicating that the first stage of intercourse with a menstruating woman is also prohibited. |
| Leviticus 20:18 | “And a man who lies with a woman who is afflicted, | Makkot 14b:4 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>he does not hold in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> says that Rabbi Hoshaya says in this regard, <b>and he derives</b> liability to bring two sin-offerings for one who unwittingly blends and applies anointing oil <b>from</b> a superfluous term elsewhere: <b>“And a man who lies with a woman who is afflicted,</b> and…both of them shall be excised” (Leviticus 20:18). Intercourse with a menstruating woman is already included in the verse: “For anyone who performs any of these abominations, the souls who do so shall be excised from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). Since this verse does not introduce any nuance concerning the punishment of <i>karet</i> for one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman, an unrelated matter is derived, which establishes liability for one who blends anointing oil and for one who applies anointing oil to receive <i>karet</i> if he performed either act intentionally, and to bring a sin-offering if he performed either act unwittingly. |
| Leviticus 20:18 | as it is stated: “And a man who lies with a woman who is afflicted, and uncovers her nakedness” | Makkot 14b:5 | <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion of the Rabbis, what is derived from the verse? <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for him to</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a woman is impure</b> as a menstruating woman <b>only if the blood of menstruation is discharged through her vagina?</b> Blood discharged from any other orifice does not render her impure. It is derived <b>as it is stated: “And a man who lies with a woman who is afflicted, and uncovers her nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), which <b>teaches that a woman is impure only if the blood of menstruation is discharged through her vagina.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:18 | her blood [ dameha ]; | Niddah 19a:19 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: <b>The verse states,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman: “And she shall be purified from the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 12:7). The plural form of the word blood, <i>dameha</i>, indicates at least two types of blood. And another verse states: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source, and she has uncovered the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>];</b> both of them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 20:18). The use of the plural form of blood once again indicates another two types, which means that <b>there are four</b> types of blood stated <b>here.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:18 | “ Dameha ” | Niddah 19a:22 | § The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, and like the liquid that drips from roast meat, are ritually impure. The Gemara asks: <b>But do Beit Shammai not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two mentions of the plural form of blood: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b> |
| Leviticus 20:18 | “ Dameha ” | Niddah 19b:2 | § The mishna states: Blood that is <b>green, Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But does Akavya</b> ben Mahalalel <b>not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two verses: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b> |
| Leviticus 20:18 | As it is stated: “And a man who lies with a woman having her flow, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source” | Niddah 41b:6 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> here, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a woman does not become impure</b> due to menstruation <b>unless the flow</b> of blood <b>emerges from her nakedness,</b> i.e., genitalia? <b>As it is stated: “And a man who lies with a woman having her flow, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source”</b> (Leviticus 20:18) This <b>teaches that a woman is not impure</b> due to menstruation <b>unless</b> the <b>flow emerges from her nakedness.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:18 | by Torah law? As it is stated: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked [ he’era ] her fountain” | Yevamot 54a:11 | § We learned in the mishna that <b>both one who</b> merely <b>begins the act of intercourse</b> and one who completes it has acquired the <i>yevama</i> through this act. <b>Ulla said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the initial stage of intercourse</b> is considered an act of sexual intercourse <b>by Torah law? As it is stated: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked [<i>he’era</i>] her fountain”</b> (Leviticus 20:18). The verse is referring to the first stage of intercourse, and <b>from here</b> it is derived that <b>the initial stage of intercourse [<i>ha’ara’a</i>]</b> is considered sexual intercourse <b>by Torah law.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:19 | said to him: | Sanhedrin 55a:7 | Rava <b>said to him:</b> In the verse: “And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister; for he has made naked [<i>he’era</i>] his relative” (Leviticus 20:19), the word <i>he’era</i> alludes to the initial stage of intercourse [<i>ha’ara</i>]. <b>If</b> the word <i>he’era</i> <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of the initial stage of intercourse</b> in the context <b>where it is written,</b> i.e., for the prohibition of intercourse with one’s <b>father’s sister and</b> one’s <b>mother’s sister, as it is not necessary</b> in that context since the <i>halakha</i> of the initial stage of intercourse with regard to all forbidden sexual relations is <b>compared</b> by the Torah <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the initial stage of intercourse</b> mentioned <b>with regard to a menstruating woman, apply it</b> instead <b>to</b> the <b>matter of the initial stage of intercourse with an animal.</b> The superfluous expression that appears in the verse concerning one’s aunt teaches that the initial stage of intercourse is considered intercourse even with regard to an animal. |
| Leviticus 20:19 | a father’s sister and a mother’s sister, as it is written: “And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister; for he has made naked [ he’era ] his kin” | Yevamot 54a:15 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> in other cases <b>comes from</b> a verse with regard to <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister, as it is written: “And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister; for he has made naked [<i>he’era</i>] his kin”</b> (Leviticus 20:19). The Gemara asks: <b>It is</b> possible <b>to refute</b> this source as follows: <b>What</b> comparison can be made between other women with whom relations are forbidden and <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister, which are</b> unique in that they are prohibited due to <b>a prohibition that comes on its own?</b> The prohibition with regard to a father’s sister and a mother’s sister does not stem from marriage, but from the biological fact that she is his father’s or mother’s sister. It is therefore dissimilar to prohibitions that result from marriage. |
| Leviticus 20:19 | why do I need | Yevamot 54b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse is as stated above, <b>why do I need</b> this <i>halakha</i> to be indicated by the word <i>he’era</i> (Leviticus 20:19) in the case of <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister?</b> |
| Leviticus 20:20 | “his uncle.” It is written here: “He has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness” | Yevamot 54b:22 | <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“his uncle”</b> and <b>“his uncle.” It is written here: “He has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:20), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to the redemption of a Jew who has been sold to a gentile: <b>“Either his uncle or his uncle’s son shall redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of redemption, it must be a relative <b>from the</b> side of his <b>father and not from the</b> side of his <b>mother, so too here,</b> with regard to forbidden relations, the prohibition applies to the wife of his father’s brother <b>from</b> his <b>father,</b> i.e., the wife of his father’s paternal brother, <b>and not from</b> his <b>mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:21 | a brother’s wife, as it is written: “And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity [ nidda ]” | Yevamot 54a:13 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> in other cases <b>comes from</b> a verse about <b>a brother’s wife, as it is written: “And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity [<i>nidda</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 20:21). The word <i>nidda</i> generally refers to a menstruating woman, and so the Gemara asks: <b>Is his brother’s wife always menstruating? Rather,</b> it means that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to her is <b>like</b> that of <b>a menstruating woman: Just as</b> one is liable to receive punishment for violating the prohibition against engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman through the initial stage of intercourse, so too,</b> one is liable to receive punishment for violating the prohibition against engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>a brother’s wife through the initial stage of intercourse.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:21 | the verse states: “And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity [ nidda ]” | Yevamot 54b:7 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity [<i>nidda</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 20:21). <b>Is his brother’s wife</b> necessarily <b>a menstruating woman [<i>nidda</i>]? Rather,</b> she is <b>like a menstruating woman</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a menstruating woman, although she has a permitted</b> stage <b>afterward, at the time</b> that she is <b>forbidden,</b> one who has intercourse with her is liable <b>to</b> receive the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a brother’s wife, although she has a permitted</b> stage <b>afterward, during her husband’s lifetime</b> marriage to her brother-in-law is punishable <b>by <i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:21 | “He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; | Yevamot 55a:14 | The Gemara responds: The Torah <b>wrote a different verse</b> to teach that the prohibition against marrying one’s brother’s wife is in full force, including the punishment of <i>karet</i>, in these cases: <b>“He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness;</b> they shall be childless” (Leviticus 20:21). Therefore, the extra phrase mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> can indicate that the prohibition against marrying one’s brother’s wife applies both to the wife of a paternal brother and to the wife of a maternal brother. |
| Leviticus 20:21 | “They shall die childless” | Yevamot 55a:20 | The Gemara poses another question: <b>Why do I need</b> the phrase that <b>the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s aunt,</b> which states: <b>They shall be childless?</b> The death of one’s children is included in the punishment of <i>karet</i>, and it has already been established that all of the forbidden intercourse is punishable by <i>karet</i>. The Gemara answers that it is necessary <b>for that</b> which <b>Rabba</b> said, <b>as Rabba raised a contradiction: It is written</b> with regard to one who had intercourse with his brother’s wife: <b>“They shall be childless”</b> (Leviticus 20:22), <b>and it</b> also <b>states</b> with regard to one who had intercourse with his aunt: <b>“They shall die childless”</b> (Leviticus 20:21). <b>How so?</b> If <b>he</b> already <b>has children, he will</b> eventually <b>bury them;</b> if <b>he does not have children, he will go childless.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:22 | “They shall be childless” | Yevamot 55a:20 | The Gemara poses another question: <b>Why do I need</b> the phrase that <b>the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s aunt,</b> which states: <b>They shall be childless?</b> The death of one’s children is included in the punishment of <i>karet</i>, and it has already been established that all of the forbidden intercourse is punishable by <i>karet</i>.

| Leviticus 20:25 | detestable” | Makkot 16b:11 | <b>Rav Aḥai says: One who delays</b> relieving himself through <b>his orifices</b> when the need arises <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “You shall not make</b> your souls <b>detestable”</b> (Leviticus 20:25). <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye says: One who drinks from the horn of a bloodletter</b> through which blood has passed <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “You shall not make</b> your souls <b>detestable.”</b> |
| Leviticus 20:25 | “You shall separate between the kosher animal and the non-kosher, and between the non-kosher bird and the kosher; and you shall not make your souls detestable by animal, or by bird, or by anything that swarms on the ground, which I have set apart for you as impure” | Meilah 16b:2 | The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The verse states: <b>“You shall separate between the kosher animal and the non-kosher, and between the non-kosher bird and the kosher; and you shall not make your souls detestable by animal, or by bird, or by anything that swarms on the ground, which I have set apart for you as impure”</b> (Leviticus 20:25). <b>The verse opens with eating</b> creeping animals, in the phrase “You shall not make your souls detestable,” <b>and</b> it <b>ends with</b> the <b>ritual impurity</b> of creeping animals: “Which I have set apart for you as impure.” |
| Leviticus 20:25 | detestable” | Meilah 17a:1 | Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava: <b>When the Merciful One juxtaposes</b> kosher and non-kosher animals to creeping animals, this is referring <b>to</b> the prohibition of: “You shall <b>not make</b> your souls <b>detestable”</b> (Leviticus 20:25), teaching that they are all included in that prohibition. <b>But with regard to measures</b> the Torah does <b>not</b> juxtapose those animals to creeping animals. For this reason there is no difference between the measure of impurity of carcasses of kosher animals and non-kosher animals. |
| Leviticus 20:26 | taught in a baraita : | Berakhot 53b:32 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> of this: <b>I do not know of Zilai or Zivai or Zuhamai; rather, I know a <i>baraita</i>, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> that it was <b>taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> It is stated: “And you shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy, for holy am I, the Lord your God” (Leviticus 20:26). With regard to this verse, the Sages said: <b>And you shall sanctify yourselves, these are the first waters</b> with which one washes his hands before the meal; <b>and you shall be holy, these are the final waters; for holy, this is oil</b> which one spreads on his hands; <b>am I, the Lord your God, this is</b> the Grace after Meals <b>blessing.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:27 | Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers. And why were they singled out | Berakhot 21b:11 | With regard to this proof <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And does</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed this matter to that warrant taking</b> this person <b>out to be stoned?</b> Should he be sentenced to the most severe of the death penalties on that basis <b>Rather,</b> the source is: <b>Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers. And why were they singled out</b> from the rest, in the verse: “And a man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones, their blood is upon them” (Leviticus 20:27)? In order to <b>draw an analogy to them and say to you: Just as a medium and a wizard</b> are executed <b>by stoning, so too is a sorceress</b> executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:27 | death | Keritot 3b:18 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Reish Lakish disagrees with the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>because</b> the cases of a necromancer and a sorcerer <b>are divided</b> in the verse <b>with regard to</b> the issue of the <b>death</b> penalty, i.e., one is liable to receive the death penalty for transgressing either prohibition, as it is stated: “And a man also or a woman, who are a necromancer or a sorcerer shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:27). Consequently, one would be liable to bring a separate sin offering for the unwitting transgression of either prohibition were it not for the fact that sorcery does not involve an action. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>a division of a prohibition is</b> considered <b>a division</b> that leads to separate sin offerings, whereas <b>a division of</b> separate <b>death</b> penalties <b>is not</b> considered <b>a division</b> in this regard. |
| Leviticus 20:27 | and it is stated with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “Their blood shall be upon them” | Keritot 5a:18 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is stated here,</b> with regard to engaging in intercourse with specific relatives: <b>“Their blood shall be upon them”</b> (Leviticus 20:11–16), <b>and it is stated with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “Their blood shall be upon them”</b> (Leviticus 20:27). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse specifies that a necromancer and a sorcerer are executed <b>by stoning, so too here,</b> with regard to one who engages in intercourse with those relatives, they are executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:27 | a necromancer and a sorcerer, | Sanhedrin 53a:4 | § <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Abaye:</b> With regard to <b>the rest of those</b> transgressors, other than necromancers and sorcerers, <b>who are stoned</b> to death, <b>with regard to whom stoning is not</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the Torah <b>because</b> their punishment is <b>derived</b> via a verbal analogy <b>from</b> that of <b>a necromancer and a sorcerer,</b> about which the verse states: “They shall be put to death, they shall stone them with stones, their blood shall be upon them” (Leviticus 20:27); <b>through what</b> verbal analogy <b>is</b> their punishment <b>derived?

| Leviticus 20:27 | It is stated here: “Their blood shall be upon them,” and it is stated with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “Their blood shall be upon them” | Sanhedrin 54a:3 | From the phrase “both of them <b>shall be put to death”</b> it is derived that they are executed <b>by stoning.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that that they are executed <b>by stoning, or is it rather by one of all the</b> other types of the <b>death</b> penalty <b>that are stated in the Torah?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here: “Their blood shall be upon them,” and it is stated with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “Their blood shall be upon them”</b> (Leviticus 20:27). <b>Just as there</b> the verse states that a necromancer and a sorcerer are executed <b>by stoning, so too here,</b> with regard to one who engages in intercourse with his father’s wife, the transgressors are executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:27 | that are stated in the Torah? It is stated here: “Their blood shall be upon them,” and it is stated with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “Their blood shall be upon them” | Sanhedrin 54a:31 | The phrase <b>“they shall be put to death”</b> is referring to execution <b>by stoning.

| Leviticus 20:27 | their blood shall be upon them” | Sanhedrin 66a:11 | From the phrase <b>“shall be put to death”</b> it is derived that his punishment is execution <b>by stoning.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: Do <b>you say</b> that that they are executed <b>by stoning, or is it rather by one of all the</b> other types of <b>death</b> penalty <b>stated in the Torah?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here: “His blood shall be upon him,” and it is stated below,</b> with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “They shall be put to death; they shall stone them with stones; <b>their blood shall be upon them”</b> (Leviticus 20:27). <b>Just as there</b> the verse states that a necromancer and a sorcerer are executed <b>by stoning, so too here,</b> with regard to one who curses his father or mother, he is executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:27 | Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers. And why were they singled out | Yevamot 4a:7 | <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehuda claims that the source is the following statement: <b>Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers. And why were they singled out</b> from the rest in the verse: “And a man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones, their blood is upon them” (Leviticus 20:27)? It is to <b>draw an analogy to them and say to you: Just as a medium and a wizard</b> are executed <b>by stoning, so too, a sorceress</b> is executed <b>by stoning.</b> This shows that Rabbi Yehuda does not derive homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed verses. |
| Leviticus 21:1 | a prohibition: | Bava Metzia30a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> case <b>was a verse necessary</b> to derive that one may disregard a lost item? <b>If we say</b> that the verse is necessary <b>for</b> the case of <b>a priest and</b> the lost item <b>in the graveyard,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he need not return the item, as <b>this</b> obligation to return the lost item <b>is a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and that</b> entry of a priest into a graveyard is prohibited by both <b>a prohibition:</b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 21:6); and there is a principle that <b>a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition and a positive mitzva. And furthermore, we do not override</b> a ritual <b>prohibition in the face of monetary matters.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:1 | a prohibition: | Bava Metzia32a:15 | The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that a priest must not obey his father’s command to become impure is <b>because the Merciful One writes: “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>;</b> I am the Lord”; <b>but</b> if <b>it were not so, I would say</b> that the child <b>must obey him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why? This</b> obligation to obey a parent is <b>a positive mitzva,</b> as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12), <b>and that</b> obligation of a priest to refrain from becoming impure is both <b>a prohibition:</b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 19:2); <b>and</b> the principle is that <b>a positive mitzva does not come and override a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:1 | Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse, as it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, | Kiddushin 35b:2 | § The mishna teaches that women are obligated in all prohibitions <b>except for</b> the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of one’s head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard, and: Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> a woman of priestly lineage is not obligated in the mitzva of: <b>Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse, as it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: None shall become impure for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). This verse teaches that the prohibition applies to <b>the sons of Aaron, but not the daughters of Aaron. But from where do we</b> derive the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of one’s head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard? |
| Leviticus 21:1 | women are exempt. | Kiddushin 35b:7 | <b>Abaye said: You cannot say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to destroying, as it is derived</b> that a woman is exempt through the verbal analogy of <b>“the corners</b> of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27) here and <b>“the corners</b> of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5) <b>from the sons of Aaron: Just as there,</b> in the case of priests, <b>women are</b> certainly <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva, as the verse is referring to the male descendants of Aaron who perform the Temple service and not to women, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the prohibition against destroying one’s beard, which is stated to all Jews, <b>women are exempt.</b> At this stage the Gemara assumes that the exclusion of women denoted by the verse: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), which excludes women, is applied to all the mitzvot stated in that chapter, including destroying the corners of one’s beard. |
| Leviticus 21:1 | writes: “The sons of Aaron” | Kiddushin 35b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But if we maintain that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes: “The sons of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 21:1), it <b>is written with regard to the entire manner</b> of that chapter, including the prohibition against destroying one’s beard, <b>let the verse,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>be silent</b> and not state <b>about</b> this prohibition concerning all Jews. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as <b>I</b> could <b>say</b> the following: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot,</b> this prohibition applies only to <b>the sons of Aaron and not the daughters of Aaron,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case with regard to <b>Israelites,</b> who have fewer mitzvot, that only men should be obligated and not women? |
| Leviticus 21:1 | writes: | Kiddushin 36a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But if we maintain that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes:</b> “The sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), it <b>is written with regard to the entire matter</b> of that chapter, including the prohibition against causing baldness, <b>let the verse be silent about</b> this prohibition concerning all Jews. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as <b>I</b> could <b>say</b> the following: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot,</b> the prohibition against causing baldness applies only to <b>the sons of Aaron and not the daughters of Aaron,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case with regard to <b>Israelites,</b> who have fewer mitzvot, that only the men should be obligated and not the women? |
| Leviticus 21:1 | and say to them” | Nazir 43b:8 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may not become impure for a spine and a skull, or for most of the skeleton or most of the number</b> of bones from his sister’s corpse. Therefore, it is <b>written</b> at the beginning of this passage dealing with the impurity of priests: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, <b>and say to them”</b> (Leviticus 21:1). The repetition of “speak” and “say” indicates that <b>the verse added a different</b> form of <b>impurity</b> permitted to a priest. |
| Leviticus 21:1 | are stated with regard to a common priest | Nazir 48b:3 | The <i>baraita</i> refutes this proof: <b>Or</b> perhaps you can <b>go this way</b> and accept a different interpretation: <b>General</b> prohibitions <b>are stated with regard to a common priest</b> contracting impurity imparted by a corpse, i.e., “there shall none defile himself for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and general</b> prohibitions <b>are stated with regard to a nazirite. Just as</b> the <b>general</b> prohibitions <b>stated with regard to a common priest</b> teach that he <b>may become impure to</b> bury <b>his father</b> (Leviticus 21:2), <b>so too,</b> the <b>general</b> prohibitions <b>stated with regard to a nazirite</b> say that he <b>may become impure to</b> bury <b>his father.</b> Perhaps a nazirite is compared to a common priest, not a High Priest. |
| Leviticus 21:1 | the verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, | Rosh Hashanah16b:10 | <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And their carcass you shall not touch.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> ordinary <b>Jews are prohibited from touching an animal carcass.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). It is derived from here that <b>the sons of Aaron are prohibited</b> from defiling themselves, but <b>the children of Israel,</b> i.e., non-priests, <b>are not prohibited</b> from doing so. |
| Leviticus 21:1 | The verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, | Sotah 23b:4 | The mishna states: <b>A daughter of a priest may become impure</b> with impurity imparted by a corpse, but a priest may not. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: None shall become impure for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). The verse indicates that this applies to <b>the sons of Aaron and not</b> to <b>the daughters of Aaron.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:1 | What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: There shall none become impure for the dead among his people” | Sotah 3a:22 | <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: There shall none become impure for the dead among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:1), indicating that a priest is enjoined from contact with the dead, it <b>was necessary to be written: “For her may he become impure,”</b> which teaches that a priest may become impure at the burial of a relative. |
| Leviticus 21:1 | and say | Yevamot 114a:15 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Speak</b> to the priests, the sons of Aaron, <b>and say</b> to them: None shall become impure for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). This reiteration of “speak” and “and say” comes <b>to warn adults concerning minors. What, is it not</b> the case <b>that</b> this means adults must <b>say to</b> children: <b>Do not become impure?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is possible to interpret <b>that</b> an adult should <b>not render</b> children <b>impure by</b> direct <b>action.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:1 | the sons of Aaron, | Yevamot 85a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the prohibition for priests to contract <b>ritual impurity</b> from a corpse, <b>which is a prohibition that is not equally</b> applicable <b>to all,</b> as only priests are bound by this prohibition, <b>and the reason</b> that this command applies only to male priests is <b>that the Merciful One writes:</b> “Speak to the priests <b>the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: None shall defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), from which it is inferred: <b>The sons of Aaron and not the daughters of Aaron. Therefore,</b> were it <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> specific derivation, <b>I would say</b> that <b>women</b> from priestly families <b>are</b> also <b>obligated</b> to avoid becoming ritually impure. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not due to</b> the principle that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav</b> said, that women are equated to men with regard to all punishments in the Torah, including those that are not equally applicable to all? |
| Leviticus 21:2 | “For his father” | Nazir 44a:3 | <b>And they said</b> to Rabbi Yitzḥak that the verse states: <b>“For his father”</b> (Leviticus 21:2), which indicates a priest may become impure only <b>when</b> his father <b>is whole, and not when he is lacking.</b> After three years the father’s body was certainly not whole, and therefore his son, a priest, was no longer permitted to become impure to bury him. |
| Leviticus 21:2 | his father | Nazir 48b:3 | The <i>baraita</i> refutes this proof: <b>Or</b> perhaps you can <b>go this way</b> and accept a different interpretation: <b>General</b> prohibitions <b>are stated with regard to a common priest</b> contracting impurity imparted by a corpse, i.e., “there shall none defile himself for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and general</b> prohibitions <b>are stated with regard to a nazirite.

| Leviticus 21:2 | “his kin” | Sanhedrin 28b:12 | The Gemara comments: That <i>halakha</i> does not serve as a proof for the <i>halakha</i> of testimony, as <b>there,</b> with regard to ritual impurity and the like, <b>the Merciful One renders it dependent on</b> the question of whether the woman is <b>“his kin”</b> (Leviticus 21:2), and a betrothed woman <b>is not yet his kin,</b> as they are not yet married. But <b>here,</b> with regard to testimony, <b>it is due to a sense of affinity</b> that he is disqualified, <b>and</b> one <b>feels a sense of affinity toward</b> his betrothed. |
| Leviticus 21:2 | “Except for his kin, | Sotah 3a:23 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive that it is mandatory? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> that it is permissible <b>from</b> the previous verse, which states: <b>“Except for his kin,</b> that is near to him” (Leviticus 21:2). Since it is derived that it is permitted from that verse, <b>why do I</b> need the additional verse: <b>“For her may he become impure”? To</b> teach that it is <b>mandatory.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:2 | that it is written: “But to his relative, who is close to him, | Yevamot 90b:12 | § The mishna taught: <b>Neither this one,</b> her first husband, <b>nor that one,</b> her second, <b>may become impure for her,</b> if they were priests. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains <b>that it is written: “But to his relative, who is close to him,</b> for her he may defile himself” (Leviticus 21:2), <b>and the Master said: “His relative” is his wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:3 | for her he becomes impure” | Nazir 43b:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav Ḥisda’s opinion. The superfluous term “for her” in the verse “And for his sister a virgin who is near to him, who has no husband, <b>for her he becomes impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3) teaches that it is <b>to</b> bury <b>her</b> in her whole state that <b>he becomes impure, but he does not become impure to</b> bury <b>her limbs.</b> If a limb was severed from her during her lifetime he does not tend to it, <b>because he may not become impure to</b> bury <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from</b> one of his <b>living</b> relatives, including <b>that of</b> his <b>father. However, he may search for a bone that is a barley-grain-bulk.</b> If he was already impure from his father’s body, he may search for and bury a bone that was detached from the corpse, even if it is large enough to impart impurity itself. |
| Leviticus 21:3 | Rabbi Yehuda says: | Nazir 43b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this presents no difficulty, as <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> “For her he becomes impure” (Leviticus 21:3), this indicates that <b>to</b> bury <b>her he becomes impure but he does not become impure to</b> bury <b>her limbs, as he does not become impure to</b> bury <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from</b> one of his <b>living</b> relatives, including <b>that of</b> his <b>father. However, he does become impure to</b> bury <b>a limb from his dead father.</b> Rav Ḥisda disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and rules in accordance with the Rabbis, who maintain that a priest may become impure only to bury his relative’s whole body. |
| Leviticus 21:3 | Rav Kahana, son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, | Nazir 43b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Kahana, son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> said: The words “for her he becomes impure” (Leviticus 21:3) indicate that <b>to</b> bury <b>her he becomes impure</b> when she is whole, <b>but he does not become impure to</b> bury her <b>limbs.</b> This serves to <b>exclude an olive-bulk</b> of solid material <b>from a corpse, and an olive-bulk of fluid</b> from a corpse, <b>and a full spade of dust</b> from a corpse. |
| Leviticus 21:3 | “For her may he become impure” | Sotah 3a:13 | § The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. “And he warned his wife,”</b> i.e., the warning, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. And Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory.</b> The Gemara notes that Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva engage in a similar dispute with regard to several other verses. Although under normal circumstances it is prohibited for a priest to become ritually impure through contact with a corpse, the verse states that he may do so for the sake of burying his relatives. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>“For her may he become impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3), i.e., for a priest to participate in the burial of his sister, despite the fact that he will contract ritual impurity, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> A priest is not obligated to participate, but he may. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory</b> for him to do so. |
| Leviticus 21:3 | for her may he become impure” | Sotah 3a:21 | The Gemara discusses the second dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: “And for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband, <b>for her may he become impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3), i.e., for a priest to participate in the burial of his sister despite the fact that he will contract ritual impurity is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> A priest is not obligated to participate, but he may do so. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory</b> for him to do so. |
| Leviticus 21:3 | as follows: | Yevamot 60a:13 | The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda? They expound</b> the verse <b>as follows:</b> “And for his virgin sister, who is near to him, who has had no man, for her must he defile himself” (Leviticus 21:3). <b>“And for his virgin sister” excludes</b> one who has been <b>raped or seduced,</b> as they are not virgins. |
| Leviticus 21:3 | for her may he become impure” | Zevachim 100a:5 | The Gemara explains: <b>And from where do you say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different</b> depending on <b>whether</b> his relative died <b>before midday</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan or <b>whether</b> he died <b>after midday? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to a priest: “And for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that has had no husband, <b>for her may he become impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3). From here it is derived that it is <b>a mitzva</b> for a priest to become impure in order to bury his deceased relatives, and if he <b>did not want</b> to do so, others must <b>render him impure against his will. And an incident</b> occurred <b>involving Yosef the priest, where his wife died on Passover eve, and he did not want to become impure,</b> as he wanted to offer the Paschal offering; <b>and his brethren the priests voted and rendered him impure against his will.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:3 | for her may he become impure” | Zevachim 100a:9 | The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>From where</b> do you infer that this is the resolution to the contradiction? <b>Actually, perhaps I will say to you:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are discussing deaths that occurred <b>after midday. And this</b> <i>baraita</i>, about a nazirite, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and that</b> <i>baraita</i>, about Yosef the priest, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to a priest: “And for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that has had no husband, <b>for her may he become impure”</b> (Leviticus 21:3). This is <b>optional,</b> i.e., a priest is not obligated to become impure to bury his sister; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:4 | and it is stated there: “He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people” | Kiddushin 77a:4 | The mishna teaches that in the case of <b>an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> his daughter is fit to marry into the priesthood. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> that <b>it is stated here: “And he shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), <b>and it is stated there: “He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:4): <b>Just as there</b> the prohibition against a priest contracting ritual impurity from a corpse applies to <b>males but not females; so too here,</b> with regard to the profanation of his offspring, where the term “among his people” is also employed, it is <b>males</b> who are rendered unfit and who render their daughters unfit to marry into the priesthood when they are <i>ḥalalim</i>, <b>but not females.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:4 | to profane himself” | Nazir 43a:5 | § With regard to the ritual impurity of a corpse, <b>the Sages taught:</b> The Torah states concerning a priest’s exposure to ritual impurity imparted by a corpse: “He shall not become impure, a chief among his people, <b>to profane himself”</b> (Leviticus 21:4), from which it is derived that the prohibition does not apply <b>until the time that</b> the person with whom he comes into contact <b>dies.</b> A priest does not become impure or profane his priesthood at any earlier stage. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the verse stated with regard to a nazirite: “He shall not become impure for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die” (Numbers 6:7), from which one can infer that <b>when they die,</b> one <b>contracts ritual impurity</b> from them, i.e., not <b>until</b> the other person actually <b>dies.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:4 | But it is written: “He shall not defile himself, being a husband among his people, to profane himself” | Yevamot 22b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious,</b> as <b>he is his brother?</b> The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that a priest does not become impure for his brother of flawed lineage, <b>since it is written</b> with regard to priests: “None shall defile himself for the dead among his people <b>except for his kin, that is near unto him”</b> (Leviticus 21:1–2), <b>and the Master said “his kin”; this is his wife,</b> and a priest may defile himself for his wife. <b>But it is written: “He shall not defile himself, being a husband among his people, to profane himself”</b> (Leviticus 21:4), implying that he may not defile himself for his wife. This apparent contradiction is resolved as follows: <b>There is a husband who does become impure</b> for his wife, <b>and there is a husband who does not become impure. How so? He becomes impure for his wife if she was fit</b> and was permitted to a priest, <b>but he does not become impure for his wife</b> if she was <b>unfit</b> to marry a priest. |
| Leviticus 21:4 | written: “He shall not defile himself, a husband among his people, to profane himself” | Yevamot 90b:13 | <b>And it is</b> further <b>written: “He shall not defile himself, a husband among his people, to profane himself”</b> (Leviticus 21:4). It may be inferred from this apparent contradiction between the verses that <b>there is a husband who becomes impure</b> for his wife, <b>and there is a husband who does not become impure. How so? He becomes impure for his fit wife, but he does not become impure for his disqualified wife.</b> Since in the case of the mishna, the woman in question is disqualified with regard to both men, neither of them may become impure for her. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off | Kiddushin 35b:10 | The Gemara asks: If so, <b>now too, let us say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and the daughters of Aaron are also prohibited to destroy their beards. <b>And if</b> you maintain that the reason the prohibition stated with regard to priests does not apply to women is <b>due to</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> employing the term “the corners of,” which serves to connect the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to priests with the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to all Jews, that verbal analogy <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off</b> the corners of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest <b>would be liable</b> even if <b>he shaved his</b> beard <b>with scissors.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states,</b> in a command issued to all Jews: <b>“And you shall not destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). This teaches that one is liable only for destroying the beard to the root, which is not achieved with scissors. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “the corners | Kiddushin 35b:7 | <b>Abaye said: You cannot say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to destroying, as it is derived</b> that a woman is exempt through the verbal analogy of <b>“the corners</b> of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27) here and <b>“the corners</b> of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5) <b>from the sons of Aaron: Just as there,</b> in the case of priests, <b>women are</b> certainly <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva, as the verse is referring to the male descendants of Aaron who perform the Temple service and not to women, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the prohibition against destroying one’s beard, which is stated to all Jews, <b>women are exempt.</b> At this stage the Gemara assumes that the exclusion of women denoted by the verse: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), which excludes women, is applied to all the mitzvot stated in that chapter, including destroying the corners of one’s beard. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | the sons of Aaron. | Kiddushin 36a:2 | <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is the reason of Isi</b> for exempting women from the prohibition against baldness: <b>As he learns</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness</b> in grief over someone who is dead through a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness</b> stated with regard to <b>the sons of Aaron.</b> The verse states with regard to priests: “They shall not make baldness upon their head” (Leviticus 21:5). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to priests, <b>women are exempt,</b> as the expression “the sons of Aaron” serves to exclude the daughters of Aaron, <b>so too here, women are exempt.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “They shall not make baldness [ yikreḥu | Kiddushin 36a:5 | The Gemara asks: If so, <b>now too, let us say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and it is prohibited for the daughters of Aaron as well to cause baldness. <b>And if</b> you maintain that the reason the prohibition stated with regard to priests does not apply to women is <b>due to</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> employing the term “make baldness,” which serves to connect the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to priests with the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to all Jews, this verbal analogy <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“They shall not make baldness [<i>yikreḥu</i></b> <i>korḥa</i>]” (Leviticus 21:5). If the verse had stated only “<i>yikreḥu</i>,” one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>one made four or five</b> patches of <b>baldness he would be obligated</b> for <b>only one</b> violation, as there is only one prohibition against making a bald spot. Therefore <b>the verse also states “<i>korḥa</i>,” to render him liable for each and every one</b> of the bald spots. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | the verse states: “Upon their head” | Kiddushin 36a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Upon their head”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), with regard to the prohibition against a priest causing baldness? <b>Because it is stated: “You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he is obligated only for</b> removing the hair <b>between the eyes. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the entire head</b> in this prohibition? When <b>the verse states “upon their head,”</b> it serves <b>to render</b> a priest <b>liable</b> for removing hair <b>on</b> his entire <b>head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “They shall not create | Makkot 20a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> From the verse concerning priests: <b>“They shall not create</b> a bald spot upon their heads” (Leviticus 21:5), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>he created four or five bald spots</b> in one action, <b>he will be liable to</b> receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Bald spot,”</b> in the singular, <b>to</b> render one <b>liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every bald</b> spot. The verse continues: <b>“Upon their heads”; what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> that term? <b>Since it is stated: “You shall neither lacerate yourselves, nor place a bald spot between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that one would be liable only for</b> placing a bald spot <b>between the eyes. From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the prohibition <b>includes</b> placing a bald spot on <b>the entire head? The verse states: “Upon their heads,” to include the entire head.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “And the edge of their beard they may not shave” | Makkot 21a:6 | The mishna teaches: <b>And one is liable</b> for marring the edges of his beard <b>only if he removes</b> the hair <b>with a razor. The Sages taught</b> a halakhic midrash: The verse states: <b>“And the edge of their beard they may not shave”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that for any manner of shaving, <b>even if he shaved</b> the beard <b>with scissors, he would be liable;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “You may not mar</b> the edge of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), indicating that one is liable only for shaving that destroys the hair from the root, which is not the case with scissors. <b>If</b> the verse had stated only: <b>“You may not mar,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that even <b>if he removed</b> the hair <b>with tweezers or with a plane</b> he <b>would be liable</b> to receive lashes, as they destroy the hair from its roots; therefore, <b>the verse states: “They may not shave,”</b> indicating that only hair removal by means of shaving is prohibited, and that is not accomplished with a tweezers and a plane. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | a verbal analogy | Makkot 21a:8 | The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> if <b>he removed</b> the hair <b>with tweezers or with a plane, he would be liable</b> to receive lashes. The Gemara objects: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, it is difficult. <b>If he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy</b> that he received from his teachers between the <i>halakhot</i> of shaving written with regard to priests (Leviticus 21:5) and the <i>halakhot</i> of marring written with regard to non-priests (Leviticus 19:27), <b>let</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>require</b> shaving with <b>a razor</b> in order to render him liable, as did the Rabbis. <b>If he does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy,</b> he should <b>also not</b> exempt one who removes the hair with <b>scissors,</b> as that should be included in the category of shaving. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards” | Nazir 40b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the Rabbis;</b> how do they derive from this <i>halakha</i> that a leper must shave with a razor? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the shaving of a leper: “He shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard” (Leviticus 14:9). Since the verse states: “All his hair,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “His beard”?</b> It is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the same</b> should <b>also</b> apply to <b>a leper,</b> i.e. that a leper who was a priest should be prohibited from shaving his beard. For this reason <b>the verse states: “His beard,”</b> which emphasizes that despite the general prohibition barring a priest from shaving his beard, a priest who is a leper is obligated to do so. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards” | Nazir 40b:5 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> this shaving of a leper must be performed <b>with a razor?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the prohibition against a priest shaving his beard in the verse <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5): One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest should <b>be liable even if he shaved</b> his beard <b>with scissors. The verse states,</b> in the general prohibition issued to all Jewish men: <b>“Neither shall you destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). This teaches that one is liable only if he shaves in a destructive manner, by uprooting the hairs entirely, which excludes the use of scissors. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | be liable. The verse states: “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards” | Nazir 40b:6 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>he removed it with tweezers or planes he</b> should <b>be liable. The verse states: “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), which indicates that the priests are liable only for removing their beards in a manner of shaving. <b>How so? What is</b> the manner of <b>shaving that involves destruction? You must say this is</b> shaving with <b>a razor.</b> The Rabbis learn from here that the implement forbidden to a priest is the same one that must be used for the shaving of a leper, namely a razor. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards” | Nazir 41a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write: “His head”? And let one derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> that the mitzva of shaving overrides that prohibition <b>from</b> the term <b>“his beard”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why does the verse state: “His beard”?</b> It is <b>because</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), and therefore one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the same</b> prohibition against shaving one’s beard should <b>also</b> apply to <b>a leper.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His beard.”</b> |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard” | Nazir 58a:11 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “His beard”?</b> After all, a beard is already included in the phrase “all his hair.” The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Since it is stated,</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a priest who is a leper is included</b> in this prohibition against shaving his beard. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His beard”</b> in connection to a leper. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | Since it is stated: “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard” | Nazir 58b:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the shaving of a leper, which must be performed with a razor: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “His beard,”</b> as it already stated that he shaves all his hair? <b>Since it is stated: “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a priest</b> who is <b>a leper is included</b> in the prohibition against shaving. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “His beard,”</b> to teach that a leprous priest must shave his beard as well. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard” | Nazir 58b:5 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive that a leper must shave <b>with a razor? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that priests <b>should be liable even if they shaved</b> their beards <b>with scissors. The verse states: “And you shall not destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), which teaches that the prohibition applies only to the destruction of the beard from its roots. <b>If</b> the sole criterion is the phrase <b>“you shall not destroy,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if he extracted</b> his hair <b>with tweezers or</b> removed his hair <b>with</b> a carpenter’s <b>plane, he should</b> likewise <b>be liable</b> due to the prohibition against destroying his hair. |
| Leviticus 21:5 | “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard” | Yevamot 5a:5 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara provides an alternative suggestion: The principle that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition <b>is derived from</b> the superfluous phrase: <b>“His beard”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). <b>As it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “His beard”?</b> After all, a beard is already included in the phrase: “All his hair.” The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a leper who is a priest is included</b> in this prohibition against shaving his beard. Therefore, <b>the verse states “his beard”</b> in the case of a leper. |
| Leviticus 21:6 | and a positive mitzva: | Bava Metzia30a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> case <b>was a verse necessary</b> to derive that one may disregard a lost item? <b>If we say</b> that the verse is necessary <b>for</b> the case of <b>a priest and</b> the lost item <b>in the graveyard,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he need not return the item, as <b>this</b> obligation to return the lost item <b>is a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and that</b> entry of a priest into a graveyard is prohibited by both <b>a prohibition:</b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 21:6); and there is a principle that <b>a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition and a positive mitzva. And furthermore, we do not override</b> a ritual <b>prohibition in the face of monetary matters.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:6 | they offer; and they shall be holy” | Sanhedrin 51b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from</b> the verse: “They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of the Lord, the bread of their Lord, <b>they offer; and they shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 21:6). From the phrase “And they shall be holy” <b>it is derived</b> that all priests are considered holy, even if they cannot bring offerings in the Temple. Consequently, there is no difference in this regard between the daughter of a blemished priest and the daughter of an unblemished priest. |
| Leviticus 21:6 | “They shall be sanctified to their God” | Sanhedrin 53b:2 | The mishna continues: <b>A prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity</b> is referring to the marriage of <b>a widow to a High Priest,</b> or to the marriage of <b>a divorcée or</b> of <b>a woman who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>], to an ordinary priest.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And why do</b> the Sages <b>call it a prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity? As it is written</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“They shall be sanctified to their God”</b> (Leviticus 21:6). |
| Leviticus 21:6 | the verse states: “They shall be sacred to their God and they shall not profane | Sanhedrin 83a:4 | The Gemara asks: Is that to say, <b>by inference,</b> that a priest <b>who pours</b> oil onto a meal-offering <b>and one who mixes</b> the oil into the meal-offering, in a state of ritual impurity, <b>does not</b> violate <b>even a prohibition? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is <b>a prohibition against pouring</b> oil <b>and</b> against <b>mixing</b> oil in a state of ritual impurity derived? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “They shall be sacred to their God and they shall not profane</b> the name of their God; for the fire offerings of the Lord, the bread of their God, they offer” (Leviticus 21:6). The Gemara answers: No proof may be cited from that verse, as the prohibition against performing Temple rites that do not complete the service in a state of impurity is <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse is a mere support,</b> not a Torah prohibition. |
| Leviticus 21:6 | the verse states: “They shall be sacred to their God and they shall not desecrate | Sanhedrin 83b:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The punishment for a priest who was ritually impure, <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, and <b>who performed</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> is death at the hand of Heaven. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: From where</b> in the Torah is the <b>allusion with regard to</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day, that if he performed</b> the Temple <b>service he desecrated</b> that service? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “They shall be sacred to their God and they shall not desecrate</b> the name of their God” (Leviticus 21:6). |
| Leviticus 21:6 | As it is written: “They shall be sacred to their God” | Yevamot 20b:6 | <b>Rather,</b> Rav’s opinion is rejected, and <b>Rava said</b> an alternative explanation: The reason why a High Priest does not take <b>a widow from betrothal</b> in levirate marriage is because that relationship is <b>also</b> a violation of both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition</b> and therefore a different positive mitzva does not override it. How so? <b>As it is written: “They shall be sacred to their God”</b> (Leviticus 21:6), which teaches that there is a positive mitzva of sanctity associated with all prohibitions applying to priests. Therefore, any such prohibition contains both a positive and a negative mitzva. |
| Leviticus 21:6 | the verse states: “They shall be sacred to their God and they shall not desecrate | Zevachim 17a:2 | § The mishna teaches that sacrificial rites performed by <b>one who immersed that day</b> are disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: From where</b> in the Torah is the <b>allusion</b> with regard <b>to</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day, that if he performed</b> the Temple <b>service he desecrated</b> that service? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “They shall be sacred to their God and they shall not desecrate</b> the name of their God” (Leviticus 21:6). |
| Leviticus 21:6 | profanation from teruma , | Zevachim 17a:5 | The Gemara responds: This verse is already used to indicate another <i>halakha</i> relating to one who immersed that day: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that if one who immersed that day performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> he is liable to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven? <b>As</b> it is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between <b>profanation</b> mentioned in this context and <b>profanation from <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the verse states in this context: “And not profane the name of their God” (Leviticus 21:6), and the verse states with regard to <i>teruma</i>: “Lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it” (Leviticus 22:9). It can be inferred from this verbal analogy that one <b>who disqualifies <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., one who immersed that day, <b>profanes</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> and one <b>who does not disqualify <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., one who creates a bald spot or one who destroys his beard, <b>does not profane</b> the <b>service.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:7 | “Neither may they take a woman divorced from her husband” | Gittin 82b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion <b>is from</b> the verse <b>here,</b> where it is stated with regard to priests: <b>“Neither may they take a woman divorced from her husband”</b> (Leviticus 21:7). This verse indicates that <b>even</b> if <b>she was divorced only from her husband,</b> and was not permitted to marry others, <b>she is disqualified from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood</b> as a divorcée, i.e., she may not marry a priest even after her husband’s death. <b>Apparently,</b> all the more so, divorce that excludes certain men from the wife’s right to remarry <b>is</b> considered a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is certainly the case when the divorce permits her to marry all men with the exception of one. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | the priesthood? | Gittin 83b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the refutation</b> that Rava found for Rabbi Akiva’s second objection? <b>If we say</b> that it is that <b>the prohibition</b> against marrying into the <b>priesthood is different,</b> and therefore the <i>halakhot</i> of adultery and divorce cannot be inferred from it, <b>doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer also derive</b> his opinion <b>from the prohibition</b> against marrying into <b>the priesthood?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan stated (82b) that Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling is derived from the verse that states with regard to priests: “Neither may they take a woman divorced from her husband” (Leviticus 21:7), indicating that even if a woman was divorced only from her husband and was not permitted to marry others, she is disqualified from marrying into the priesthood as a divorcée. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | and it is stated there: “ Zona ” | Kiddushin 77b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? This repetition serves to teach that <b>a <i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only from a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood. Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>zona</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? <b>It is stated here: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), with regard to a High Priest, <b>and it is stated there: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:7), with regard to a common priest. <b>Just as here,</b> in the case of a High Priest who engages in sexual intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned,</b> in accordance with the verse: “And he shall not profane his offspring” (Leviticus 21:15), <b>so too there, in</b> the case of a common priest who engages in intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:7 | The verse states: “And a woman | Kiddushin 78a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> forbidden to a priest only <b>by rabbinic law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states in the Torah that a priest may not marry <b>a divorcée. I have</b> derived <b>only a divorcée; from where</b> do I derive that <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> is also forbidden? <b>The verse states: “And a woman</b> divorced” (Leviticus 21:7), with the additional conjunction of “and” serving to include a <i>ḥalutza</i>, that she is also considered to be a type of divorced woman. The Gemara rejects this: Even so, this prohibition is only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse is a mere support,</b> but it is not the true source of the <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | a prostitute” | Temurah 29b:19 | <b>And</b> Abaye further stated with regard to a gentile prostitute: <b>A priest who engaged in intercourse with her is not flogged for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> the prohibition with regard to priests: “They shall not take a woman who is <b>a prostitute”</b> (Leviticus 21:7). <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the verse states: “And he shall not profane his seed</b> among his people” (Leviticus 21:15). This verse indicates that the prohibition of profaning his seed applies only to a priest who engages in intercourse with a woman <b>whose offspring are attributed to him,</b> i.e., a Jew, where the lineage of the children is determined by the identity of the father. This <b>excludes</b> a priest who engaged in intercourse with <b>a gentile woman, whose offspring are not attributed to him,</b> but to her, as their child is a gentile. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | divorced | Yevamot 24a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> the prohibition against a <b><i>ḥalutza</i></b> marrying a priest really <b>by rabbinic</b> law<b>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; neither shall they take a woman <b>divorced</b> from her husband; for he is holy unto his God” (Leviticus 21:7). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a divorcée; from where</b> do I derive that a priest may not marry <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>? The verse states:</b> “Neither shall they take <b>a woman.”</b> The repetition of the word “woman” extends the <i>halakha</i> to include a <i>ḥalutza</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> prohibition <b>is by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the verse is a mere support.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:7 | and a woman divorced from her husband they shall not take, | Yevamot 52a:15 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; <b>and a woman divorced from her husband they shall not take,</b> as he is holy to his God” (Leviticus 21:7). This verse lists the women whom a priest is prohibited from marrying. From this verse it can be inferred: <b>Even</b> if <b>she was only divorced from her husband</b> who said when giving her a bill of divorce: You are divorced from me, but did not permit her to other men, even such a woman <b>they may not take</b> in marriage. Although a bill of divorce of this kind does not permit the woman to others, it does suffice to prohibit her from marrying a priest. <b>And this is</b> what is referred to as <b>the trace of a bill of divorce, which disqualifies</b> a woman from marrying <b>into the priesthood.</b> Since this bill of divorce is valid to a certain extent, it also disqualifies a <i>yevama</i>. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | into the priesthood, | Yevamot 68b:10 | The Gemara rejects that response: <b>But that provides</b> support for the contrary reasoning. It is logical that <b>a priestess, who is herself sacred, is disqualified</b> by intercourse with an unfit man. However, with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>who is not sacred herself,</b> and who eats <i>teruma</i> only due to her son, intercourse with an unfit man should <b>not disqualify her. Rather,</b> the prohibition against these women marrying <b>into the priesthood</b> is derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a divorcée: If a divorcée</b> who is the daughter of a priest, <b>who is permitted to</b> partake of <b><i>teruma</i>, is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> from marrying <b>into the priesthood,</b> as is written in the Torah (Leviticus 21:7), then with regard to <b>this</b> woman, for <b>whom</b> it <b>is prohibited to</b> partake of <b><i>teruma</i>, is it not right that</b> she should be <b>disqualified</b> from marrying <b>into the priesthood?</b> |
| Leviticus 21:7 | “They may not take | Yevamot 84b:15 | <b>Ravin bar Naḥman raised an objection</b> against Rav’s ruling from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states about priests: <b>“They may not take</b> a woman who is a harlot [<i>zona</i>], or profaned [<i>ḥalala</i>]” (Leviticus 21:7). The same verse says: <b>“They</b> also <b>may not take</b> a woman divorced from her husband.” This repetition of “they may not take” <b>teaches</b> us <b>that the woman is</b> also <b>prohibited by means of</b> the prohibition addressed to <b>the man.</b> Therefore, we can conclude that there is a prohibition for a daughter of a priest to marry a <i>ḥalal</i>. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | a woman divorced from her husband” | Yevamot 92a:14 | If <b>they said to her: Your husband died, and she became betrothed</b> to another man, <b>and afterward her husband came, she is permitted to return to him,</b> as betrothal alone does not render her forbidden to her husband. Furthermore, <b>although</b> the <b>last</b> man, i.e., her betrothed, <b>gave her a bill of divorce,</b> he has <b>not</b> thereby <b>disqualified her</b> from marrying into the priesthood. She was never his wife, for the betrothal was invalid, and a bill of divorce given to the wife of another man does not disqualify her. <b>This was taught by Rabbi Elazar ben Matya:</b> The verse states with regard to priests: <b>“Neither</b> shall they take <b>a woman divorced from her husband”</b> (Leviticus 21:7), which indicates: <b>And not</b> one who was divorced <b>from a man who is not her husband,</b> e.g., the second man in this case. |
| Leviticus 21:7 | this was an exposition taught by Rabbi Elazar ben Matya: | Yevamot 94a:10 | § The mishna states that <b>this was an exposition taught by Rabbi Elazar ben Matya:</b> The verse states with regard to priests: “Neither shall they take a woman divorced from her husband” (Leviticus 21:7). This teaches that a woman is not disqualified from marrying into the priesthood by a bill of divorce she receives from a man other than her husband. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Rabbi Elazar should have taught</b> this verse as <b>a pearl but</b> in fact <b>he taught it as an earthenware shard.</b> In other words, he could have arrived at a more significant conclusion. |
| Leviticus 21:8 | “And you shall sanctify him” | Gittin 59b:9 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here,</b> as it is stated with regard to a priest: <b>“And you shall sanctify him”</b> (Leviticus 21:8), giving a priest priority <b>for every matter of sanctity.</b> And with regard to this verse, a Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: “And you shall sanctify him,”</b> giving a priest priority <b>for every matter of sanctity: To open</b> the discussion in the study hall <b>first, to recite the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals <b>first, and to take a fine portion</b> at a meal <b>first,</b> meaning that he can choose any portion at a meal for himself. |
| Leviticus 21:8 | “And you shall sanctify him, | Horayot 12b:22 | The mishna continues: <b>And anyone who is</b> more <b>sanctified than another precedes</b> that <b>other</b> person. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive these matters? It is <b>as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that from the verse written with regard to a priest: <b>“And you shall sanctify him,</b> as he sacrifices the bread of your God, he shall be holy unto you” (Leviticus 21:8), it is derived that a priest should be esteemed and granted precedence <b>with regard to any matter of sanctity.</b> He should be the one <b>to open first</b> in the reading of the Torah, <b>and to recite the blessing</b> of the <i>zimmun</i> <b>first, and to take a fine portion first.</b> The priest who is more sanctified takes precedence. |
| Leviticus 21:8 | “You shall sanctify him, | Moed Katan28b:28 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the priest himself</b> sits at the head? The Gemara answers: <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to a priest it says: <b>“You shall sanctify him,</b> for he offers the bread of your God” (Leviticus 21:8), meaning that you are to sanctify him <b>with regard to all matters of sanctity: To be first to begin</b> reading the Torah, <b>to be first to recite the Grace</b> after Meals, <b>and to be first to take a portion</b> during a meal. |
| Leviticus 21:8 | As it is written: “And you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God” | Nedarim 62a:12 | <b>Rava said</b> further: <b>It is permitted for a Torah scholar to say: I am a Torah scholar,</b> so <b>resolve my case first, as it is written: “And the sons of David were priests”</b> (II Samuel 8:18). The sons of David could not have been actual priests, as David was not a priest. Rather, the verse indicates that <b>just as a priest takes</b> his portion <b>first, so too, a Torah scholar takes</b> his portion <b>first. And a priest, from where do we</b> derive that he takes his portion first? <b>As it is written: “And you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God”</b> (Leviticus 21:8). <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The phrase <b>“and you shall sanctify him”</b> applies with regard <b>to every matter of sanctity:</b> |
| Leviticus 21:8 | “And you shall sanctify him | Yevamot 88b:5 | <b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a priest <b>does not want</b> to observe the strictures against disqualified women, that the court <b>forces him [<i>dafno</i>]</b> by flogging him, and it sanctifies him despite his wishes? <b>The verse states,</b> at the end of the chapter that deals with the prohibitions of the priesthood: <b>“And you shall sanctify him</b>…he shall be sacred for you” (Leviticus 21:8), which indicates that this is performed even <b>against his will.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:9 | in fire she shall be burned” | Pesachim 75a:12 | The Gemara expresses surprise at the previous answer: <b>And are</b> red-hot <b>pieces of metal not</b> considered <b>fire? But with regard to a daughter of a priest</b> who committed adultery after betrothal, <b>it is written:</b> “And the daughter of a priest, if she profanes herself through adultery, she profanes her father; <b>in fire she shall be burned”</b> (Leviticus 21:9), <b>and Rav Mattana said:</b> They would not literally burn her in fire; rather, <b>they would prepare for her</b> a molten <b>bar of lead.</b> They would execute her by pouring molten lead down her throat. This proves that burning metal is considered fire. |
| Leviticus 21:9 | “her father” is stated with regard to burning, | Sanhedrin 50a:10 | The Gemara answers: The severity of burning is derived by means of a verbal analogy. The term <b>“her father” is stated with regard to stoning,</b> in the verse: “And the men of her city shall stone her with stones and she shall die, because she has done a depraved thing in Israel, to play the harlot in the house of her father” (Deuteronomy 22:21), <b>and</b> the term <b>“her father” is stated with regard to burning,</b> in the verse: “And the daughter of a priest, when she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). Therefore, <b>just as</b> concerning the term <b>“her father” that is stated with regard to stoning</b> it is established that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, so too,</b> concerning the term <b>“her father” that is stated with regard to burning,</b> it may be established that <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:9 | “And the daughter of a priest [ ish kohen ], when she profanes | Sanhedrin 50b:18 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of a priest [<i>ish kohen</i>], when she profanes</b> herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). One <b>might</b> have thought that the expression “when she profanes [<i>ki teḥel</i>]” is referring <b>even</b> to one who <b>desecrated [<i>ḥillela</i>] Shabbat;</b> she too should be executed by burning. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “By playing the harlot”; the verse is speaking of profanation through promiscuity.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:9 | “And the daughter of a priest, when she profanes herself by playing the harlot” | Sanhedrin 51b:9 | § The Gemara discusses the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael that the betrothed daughter of a priest who committed adultery is executed by burning, whereas the married daughter of a priest who committed adultery is executed by strangulation. <b>What</b> is the source for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: <b>“And the daughter of a priest, when she profanes herself by playing the harlot”</b> (Leviticus 21:9), <b>the verse is speaking of a young woman who is betrothed.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:9 | “She profanes her father” | Sanhedrin 52a:1 | <b>what does he derive from this</b> verse: <b>“She profanes her father”</b> (Leviticus 21:9), if he does not employ the term “her father” for a verbal analogy concerning a young betrothed woman who committed adultery, as Rabbi Akiva does? |
| Leviticus 21:9 | “And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes [ teḥel ] herself by playing the harlot, | Sanhedrin 66b:14 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes [<i>teḥel</i>] herself by playing the harlot,</b> she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word <i>teḥel</i> means <b>first [<i>teḥila</i>]; and likewise it says: “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25). |
| Leviticus 21:9 | the daughter of any priest | Sanhedrin 76a:17 | <b>The father of Rabbi Avin teaches: Due to</b> the fact <b>that we did not learn</b> a punishment for one who engages in intercourse with <b>his daughter</b> born <b>from a woman whom he raped</b> from an explicit verse in the Torah, <b>it was necessary for the verse to state: “And</b> if <b>the daughter of any priest</b> profanes herself by acting licentiously, it is her father [<i>et aviha</i>] whom she is profaning; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). The verse can be interpreted: And if the daughter of any priest profanes herself by acting licentiously with her father [<i>et aviha</i>]…she shall be burned with fire. |
| Leviticus 21:10 | “And the priest who is greater than his brethren” | Chullin 134b:12 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a distinguished person</b> such as Rabbi Ami, who was the head of the yeshiva, <b>is different,</b> and he may acquire the gifts for himself. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“And the priest who is greater than his brethren”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), indicates <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>should be greater than his</b> priestly <b>brethren in beauty, in wisdom, and in wealth.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:10 | “Nor rend his garments” | Horayot 12b:16 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For all the dead</b> relatives for whom one rends his garments, if <b>he wishes he rends the neckline of his</b> garment <b>asunder;</b> if <b>he wishes he does not rend the neckline of his</b> garment <b>asunder.</b> If he is rending his garments <b>for his father or for his mother he rends</b> the neckline <b>asunder. Since in general, it is a tear</b> even without rending the neckline asunder, one can <b>read here</b> with regard to the High Priest: <b>“Nor rend his garments”</b> (Leviticus 21:10). This supports the opinion of Rav that the High Priest does not rend his garments from above like others do; rather, he rends his garments from below. |
| Leviticus 21:10 | the verse states: “He shall neither let the hair of his head grow, nor rend his garments” | Horayot 12b:18 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Had it been stated: He shall neither let the hair of a head grow, nor rend garments, I would have said:</b> It is <b>with regard to the head and the garment of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]</b> that <b>the verse is speaking,</b> and it means that the High Priest must not loosen her hair or rend her garments, in the manner that an ordinary priest does to the <i>sota</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall neither let the hair of his head grow, nor rend his garments”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), indicating <b>that he is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva to <b>grow long</b> hair <b>and rend</b> garments <b>at all;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yishmael says: He does not rend</b> his garments <b>in the manner that people</b> typically <b>rend</b> their garments. <b>Rather, he</b> rends his garment <b>from below and an ordinary</b> priest rends his garments <b>from above.</b> Apparently, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, the High Priest does not rend his garments at all. |
| Leviticus 21:10 | as the Sages taught: “And the priest who is greater than his brethren” | Horayot 12b:9 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches: And all these <i>halakhot</i> are not in effect with regard to a priest anointed for war, <b>except for the five matters stated in the portion</b> where the <i>halakhot</i> of the High Priest are enumerated. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught: “And the priest who is greater than his brethren”</b> (Leviticus 21:10); <b>this is a High Priest. “Upon whose head the anointing oil is poured”; this is</b> the priest <b>anointed for war. “And who is consecrated to don the garments”; this is</b> the High Priest who is consecrated by donning <b>multiple garments. With regard to all of them,</b> the verse <b>states: “He shall neither let the hair of his head grow, nor rend his garments, neither shall he come upon any dead body”</b> (Leviticus 21:10–11). |
| Leviticus 21:10 | as it is written: “And the priest that is greatest among his brethren” | Horayot 9a:2 | The <b>king</b> cannot become poor, <b>as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“And he performed one of all the mitzvot of the Lord his God”</b> (Leviticus 4:22), referring to the king as <b>one who has only the Lord his God upon him.</b> He is greater than the entire nation and is not a poor person dependent on others. <b>An anointed</b> priest cannot become poor, <b>as it is written: “And the priest that is greatest among his brethren”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), meaning <b>that he is greater than his brethren in beauty, in power, in wisdom, and in wealth,</b> not a poor person. <b>Others say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the High Priest <b>does not have</b> personal wealth, one should <b>make him great from</b> the property <b>of his brethren? The verse states: “And the priest that is greatest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil is poured”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), from which it is derived: <b>Make him great from</b> the property <b>of his brethren,</b> who will provide him with enough property to render him wealthy. |
| Leviticus 21:10 | “And the priest who is greater than his brethren” | Yoma 18a:9 | <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated: <b>“And the priest who is greater than his brethren”</b> (Leviticus 21:10); this teaches <b>that he</b> must <b>be greater than his</b> priestly <b>brethren in strength, in beauty, in wisdom, and in wealth. <i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> Wealth is not a prerequisite for selecting a High Priest, but <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that if he does not have</b> property of his own <b>that his brethren the priests elevate him</b> and render him wealthy from their own property? <b>The verse states: “And the priest who is greater [<i>haggadol</i>] than his brethren”; elevate him [<i>gaddelehu</i>] from</b> the property <b>of his brethren.</b> In any event, there is a consensus that wisdom is a prerequisite for his selection. |
| Leviticus 21:11 | “He shall not come upon any people that are a corpse [ nafshot met ]” | Chullin 72a:10 | It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the prohibition against priests coming in contact with a dead body: <b>“He shall not come upon any people that are a corpse [<i>nafshot met</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The use of the plural form “people [<i>nafshot</i>]” indicates that the blood imparts impurity even if it comes from <b>two people,</b> as blood is referred to as “<i>nefesh</i>” (see Deuteronomy 12:23), and the use of the singular form “corpse [<i>met</i>]” indicates that this blood combines to complete <b>one measure,</b> i.e., the minimum amount of a quarter-<i>log</i> required to impart impurity. |
| Leviticus 21:11 | “Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies” | Nazir 38a:6 | <b>And they died,</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:10): <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood that emerges from two corpses, that it renders</b> people and objects <b>ritually impure in a tent,</b> i.e., a house, meaning that one who enters that house contracts ritual impurity imparted by a corpse? <b>As it is stated,</b> with regard to the prohibition against ritual impurity for priests: <b>“Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The plural form indicates that the blood of two people joins together to form the minimum amount of a quarter-<i>log</i> for ritual impurity in a tent. |
| Leviticus 21:11 | “Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies; | Nazir 47b:9 | It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a High Priest: <b>“Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies;</b> nor defile himself for his father or for his mother” (Leviticus 21:11). <b>With regard to what</b> bodies <b>is the verse speaking? If</b> it is referring <b>to distant</b> people, i.e., non-relatives, <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if a common priest, who becomes impure to</b> bury his <b>close</b> family members, <b>may not become impure to</b> bury <b>distant</b> people, then with regard to <b>a High Priest, who does not become impure</b> even <b>to</b> bury <b>close</b> members of his family, <b>is it not logical that he does not become impure to</b> bury <b>distant</b> people? <b>Rather, the verse is speaking of close</b> family members, and it prohibits a High Priest from becoming impure to bury any person, even his relatives. |
| Leviticus 21:11 | and it is stated “his mother” with regard to a High Priest | Nazir 48a:3 | <b>And if you have successfully</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>from the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “his mother” with regard to a High Priest?</b> It is <b>free to</b> teach a novel <i>halakha</i>, and one can <b>compare and learn a verbal analogy from it</b> as follows: <b>It is stated “his mother” with regard to a nazirite</b> (Numbers 6:7), <b>and it is stated “his mother” with regard to a High Priest</b> (Leviticus 21:11). |
| Leviticus 21:11 | with regard to a High Priest | Nazir 48b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> questions the need for this derivation: Even <b>if</b> the verse <b>had not stated</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>I have</b> a way of deriving it <b>by right,</b> i.e., logically, with an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>General</b> prohibitions <b>are stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to a High Priest</b> contracting impurity from a corpse, i.e., “neither shall he go in to any dead bodies” (Leviticus 21:11), <b>and</b> similar <b>general</b> prohibitions <b>are stated with regard to a nazirite:</b> “He shall not come near to a dead body” (Numbers 6:6). The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Just as</b> the <b>general</b> prohibitions <b>stated with regard to a High Priest</b> teach that <b>it is to</b> bury <b>his father that he may not become impure, but he may become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>, so too,</b> the <b>general</b> prohibitions <b>stated with regard to a nazirite</b> indicate that <b>it is for his father that he may not become impure, but he may become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b> Accordingly, there is no need for the derivation from the phrase “for his father or for his mother.” |
| Leviticus 21:11 | “neither shall he go in to any dead bodies” | Nazir 49a:4 | The Gemara asks: According to the derivation of Rabbi Akiva, <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11), stated with regard to a High Priest? |
| Leviticus 21:11 | impure in a tent, as it is stated: “Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies” | Nazir 49b:1 | <b>“In to any”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> contracting impurity to bury <b>distant</b> people, for whom a High Priest may not become impure; <b>“dead”</b> comes <b>to exclude relatives; “bodies”</b> comes <b>to exclude a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood that emerges from two corpses, for it renders</b> people and objects <b>impure in a tent, as it is stated: “Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The plural “bodies” teaches that the blood of two people combines to form the minimum quantity for ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 21:11 | “Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies” | Nazir 52b:6 | <b>And furthermore, the verse supports his</b> opinion, as it states: <b>“Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The plural form “bodies” indicates that two corpses can join together, as stated by Rabbi Akiva. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All his days,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>would deem</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood from two corpses <b>ritually impure. Whether he retracted his</b> opinion <b>after he died,</b> this <b>I do not know.</b> A Sage <b>taught:</b> Rabbi Shimon’s <b>teeth blackened due to his fasts,</b> which he undertook for uttering this irreverent comment about Rabbi Akiva. |
| Leviticus 21:11 | “He shall not come upon any dead bodies” | Sanhedrin 4a:14 | With regard to <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is known that a quarter<i>-log</i> of blood that came from a corpse imparts ritual impurity in a tent. And <b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a quarter</b><i>-log</i> <b>of blood that came out of two</b> separate <b>corpses</b> also <b>imparts ritual impurity in a tent? As it is stated</b> with regard to a priest: <b>“He shall not come upon any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The word “bodies” is pronounced as a plural word, and since the Torah teaches elsewhere that: “The blood is the life” (Deuteronomy 12:23), this indicates that impurity can be imparted by <b>one measure</b> of blood that came from <b>two bodies. And the Rabbis</b> say: The word <b>“bodies” is written</b> deficient, without a <i>vav</i>, so that it can also be read as a singular word, indicating that a quarter<i>-log</i> of blood imparts impurity in a tent only if it came from a single corpse. |
| Leviticus 21:12 | the verse states: “For the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him” | Horayot 12b:10 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all of</b> these priests <b>sacrifice</b> offerings as <b>acute mourners.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him”</b> (Leviticus 21:12), from which it is derived: <b>“Upon him,”</b> the High Priest, <b>but not upon another</b> priest. <b>And after the verse differentiated</b> the priest anointed for war, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that he would not be commanded to</b> marry <b>a virgin,</b> a mitzva that appears in the following verse. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with the letter <i>vav</i> as a prefix: <b>“And he</b> shall take a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13), which serves to include the priest anointed for war. |
| Leviticus 21:12 | His God is upon him” | Keritot 7a:7 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> oil, <b>it is written: “They will die through it if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and <b>since</b> the priest <b>has</b> already <b>profaned</b> the oil by using it, it is considered <b>profaned. But with regard to the anointing oil it is written: “For the consecration</b> of the anointing oil of <b>His God is upon him”</b> (Leviticus 21:12). <b>The Merciful One calls it anointing oil</b> even at this stage, to teach <b>that even though it is upon</b> the High Priest it is <b>not</b> considered <b>profaned,</b> and instead remains sacred. |
| Leviticus 21:12 | “And he shall not profane | Nazir 42b:3 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rav Yosef from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a priest who had a corpse placed on his shoulder, and they extended his corpse,</b> i.e., the corpse of his relative, <b>to him, and</b> similarly if they extended <b>a different corpse</b> to him <b>and he touched it,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable</b> even for this contact. Therefore, <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to the prohibition against a High Priest becoming impure: <b>“And he shall not profane</b> the Sanctuary of his God” (Leviticus 21:12). This teaches that the prohibition of impurity applies <b>to one who is not</b> yet <b>profaned, excluding this one who is</b> already <b>profaned and standing</b> in that state of ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 21:12 | as it is stated: “And from the Temple he shall not emerge | Sanhedrin 18a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not emerge from the Temple</b> at all for the burial of his relatives, <b>as it is stated: “And from the Temple he shall not emerge</b> and will not desecrate the Temple of his God; for the separateness of the oil of the anointment of his God is on him” (Leviticus 21:12). |
| Leviticus 21:12 | “And from the Temple he shall not emerge” | Sanhedrin 19a:4 | § The mishna teaches with regard to the High Priest that if a relative <b>of his died,</b> he does not follow the bier carrying the corpse. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning the High Priest, which states: <b>“And from the Temple he shall not emerge”</b> (Leviticus 21:12), means: <b>He shall not emerge with them</b> as they escort the bier, <b>but he emerges after them. How so?</b> Once <b>they are concealed</b> from sight by turning onto another street, <b>he is revealed</b> on the street they departed, and when <b>they are revealed,</b> then <b>he is concealed.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:12 | Rabbi Yehuda is saying well, | Sanhedrin 19a:5 | The mishna teaches Rabbi Meir’s opinion, that in the manner just described to escort the deceased, the High Priest <b>emerges with them until the entrance</b> of the gate of the city, which is contrasted with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that he does not leave the Temple at all. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Yehuda is saying well,</b> and his statement is consistent with the straightforward meaning of the verse: “And from the Temple he shall not emerge” (Leviticus 21:12). |
| Leviticus 21:12 | “And from the Temple he shall not emerge and he shall not desecrate the Temple of his God” | Sanhedrin 84a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that it is prohibited for <b>an acute mourner</b> priest to perform the Temple service? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a High Priest whose mother or father died: <b>“And from the Temple he shall not emerge and he shall not desecrate the Temple of his God”</b> (Leviticus 21:12), from which it may be inferred <b>that another,</b> who is not a High Priest but an ordinary priest, <b>who did not emerge</b> from the Temple and who continued to perform the service, <b>has desecrated</b> the service. |
| Leviticus 21:12 | “And he shall not leave the Sanctuary, and he will not profane | Zevachim 16a:14 | § The mishna teaches that rites performed by <b>an acute mourner</b> are disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to a High Priest who is an acute mourner: <b>“And he shall not leave the Sanctuary, and he will not profane</b> the Sanctuary of his God” (Leviticus 21:12). One can infer: <b>But</b> any <b>other</b> ordinary priest <b>who did not leave</b> the Sanctuary while he was an acute mourner and continued to perform the service <b>has desecrated</b> the rites he performed. |
| Leviticus 21:12 | “And he shall not leave the Sanctuary, | Zevachim 16b:5 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Where is</b> an acute mourner <b>prohibited</b> from performing sacrificial rites, as asserted in the inference? <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And he shall not leave the Sanctuary,</b> and he will not profane the Sanctuary of his God” (Leviticus 21:12), then the above <i>a fortiori</i> inference is unnecessary, since <b>profanation itself is written in</b> the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “This day have <b>they offered</b> their sin offering?” (Leviticus 10:19), <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the sin offering brought by Aaron <b>was burned because</b> Aaron and his sons were in <b>acute mourning.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:13 | “And he | Horayot 12b:10 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all of</b> these priests <b>sacrifice</b> offerings as <b>acute mourners.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him”</b> (Leviticus 21:12), from which it is derived: <b>“Upon him,”</b> the High Priest, <b>but not upon another</b> priest. <b>And after the verse differentiated</b> the priest anointed for war, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that he would not be commanded to</b> marry <b>a virgin,</b> a mitzva that appears in the following verse. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with the letter <i>vav</i> as a prefix: <b>“And he</b> shall take a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13), which serves to include the priest anointed for war. |
| Leviticus 21:13 | we hear them say the opposite? As it is taught | Ketubot 97b:13 | Didn’t <b>we hear them say the opposite? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse that speaks about the High Priest (Leviticus 21:13): <b>“And he</b> shall take <b>a wife in her virginity,” to exclude a grown woman whose</b> sign of <b>virginity has diminished</b> because when a girl goes through puberty her hymen wears away; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon declare as fit even a grown woman</b> for the High Priest. This implies that they are of the opinion that the absence of a part is not considered the absence of the whole, and although part of her sign of virginity has been diminished, it is still present. |
| Leviticus 21:13 | a positive mitzva: | Sanhedrin 18b:14 | § The mishna teaches that the High Priest <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with his brother’s widow <b>and</b> his brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with his wife, but in any case he does not consummate levirate marriage with his brother’s wife. The Gemara comments: The mishna <b>categorically teaches</b> that the High Priest does not consummate levirate marriage, and there <b>is no difference</b> whether his brother’s wife was a widow <b>from betrothal</b> alone <b>and no difference</b> whether she was a widow <b>from a marriage</b> that had been consummated. <b>Granted,</b> it is understood that he does not consummate levirate marriage with a widow <b>from marriage,</b> since <b>there is</b> both <b>a positive mitzva:</b> “And he shall take a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13), <b>and</b> also <b>a prohibition:</b> “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take” (Leviticus 21:14), |
| Leviticus 21:13 | positive mitzva | Yevamot 20a:17 | <b>Granted,</b> she certainly may not enter into levirate marriage if she is a widow <b>from marriage,</b> since she is forbidden to the High Priest by the <b>positive mitzva</b> stated in the verse: “And he shall take a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13), <b>and</b> by the <b>prohibition</b> stated in the verse: “A widow, or one divorced…these he shall not take” (Leviticus 21:14). <b>And a positive mitzva,</b> levirate marriage, <b>does not override</b> both <b>a prohibition,</b> not marrying a widow, <b>and a positive mitzva,</b> marrying a virgin, together. <b>However,</b> if she is a widow <b>from betrothal,</b> then <b>there is only a prohibition,</b> as she is still a virgin. In that case, why not say that <b>the positive mitzva</b> of levirate marriage should <b>come and override the prohibition</b> against marrying a widow from betrothal? |
| Leviticus 21:13 | marriage, | Yevamot 59a:1 | <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>Do we follow</b> the time of <b>marriage,</b> at which point she was unfit for him according to most <i>tanna’im</i>, who hold that a High Priest may not marry a grown woman, as she is no longer called “a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13)? <b>Or do we follow</b> the time of <b>betrothal,</b> at which point she was of suitable age? |
| Leviticus 21:13 | “And he shall take a wife in her virginity” | Yevamot 59a:10 | § It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> a High Priest <b>may not marry a grown woman. The Sages taught</b> that the verse: <b>“And he shall take a wife in her virginity”</b> (Leviticus 21:13) <b>excludes a grown woman, whose hymen has worn away,</b> i.e., it is no longer as complete as that of a minor or a young woman; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon declare a grown woman fit</b> to marry a High Priest. |
| Leviticus 21:13 | “And he shall take a wife in her virginity” | Yevamot 59a:3 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef <b>said to</b> Shmuel: With regard to <b>causing her</b> to become <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> I did not raise a dilemma, as</b> it is clear <b>that it is intercourse that causes her</b> to become <b>a <i>ḥalala</i>. When I raised a dilemma,</b> it was with regard to the verse pertaining to a High Priest: <b>“And he shall take a wife in her virginity”</b> (Leviticus 21:13). <b>What</b> does “take” mean in this verse? <b>Do we require</b> that only <b>the taking of betrothal</b> must occur when she is in her virginity, i.e., when she is a minor or a young woman, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>we require</b> even <b>the taking of marriage</b> to be performed when she is a minor or young woman? |
| Leviticus 21:14 | by a High Priest. And | Ketubot 30a:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> in the case of <b>a non-virgin</b> raped <b>by a High Priest. And</b> the Gemara asks: Here, too, she is a woman for relations with whom one is liable for violating a positive mitzva, as the High Priest fails to fulfill the mitzva “But a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife” (Leviticus 21:14). If Rabbi Akiva rules that betrothal does not take effect when a positive mitzva is violated, <b>what is different</b> about this case? The Gemara answers: It is different <b>because it is a positive</b> mitzva <b>whose</b> application <b>is not equal for all.</b> There are two lenient aspects to this mitzva: It is a positive mitzva and not a prohibition, and it applies only to the High Priest and not to all Jews. Even Rabbi Yeshevav would agree that according to Rabbi Akiva, a child born from relations between a High Priest and a non-virgin is not a <i>mamzer</i>. However, the High Priest may not sustain the woman as his wife. Therefore, this case is the practical difference between the statements of Shimon HaTimni and Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | to a High Priest who acquires a virgin through sexual intercourse. | Kiddushin 10a:5 | <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference with regard <b>to a High Priest who acquires a virgin through sexual intercourse.</b> If only the end of intercourse effects acquisition, she is no longer a virgin at the time of the betrothal, which would mean that a High Priest cannot acquire a woman through intercourse, as it is prohibited for him to marry a non-virgin (Leviticus 21:14). <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Ameimar said in the name of Rava: Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse has the completion of</b> the act of <b>intercourse in mind,</b> not the beginning. Therefore, the acquisition is complete only when the act has been completed. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | It is stated here: “ Zona ” | Kiddushin 77b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? This repetition serves to teach that <b>a <i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only from a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood. Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>zona</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? <b>It is stated here: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), with regard to a High Priest, <b>and it is stated there: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:7), with regard to a common priest. <b>Just as here,</b> in the case of a High Priest who engages in sexual intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned,</b> in accordance with the verse: “And he shall not profane his offspring” (Leviticus 21:15), <b>so too there, in</b> the case of a common priest who engages in intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:14 | before Rav Sheshet: | Kiddushin 77b:9 | <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet:</b> The command addressed to the High Priest states: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife” (Leviticus 21:14). <b>Any</b> woman <b>who is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“Shall he take” is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall he not take”</b> if she becomes a widow or a divorcée. And <b>any</b> woman <b>who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“Shall he take” is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall he not take.”</b> This <b>excludes</b> the case <b>of a High Priest who engaged in intercourse with his widowed sister.</b> As his sister, she is forbidden to him even when she is a virgin, so the mitzva: “Shall he take” does not refer to her. Therefore, he does not transgress the prohibition: “Shall he not take” if he engages in intercourse with her after she had been widowed or divorced. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | shall he not take” | Kiddushin 78a:2 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says: A High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow is flogged two</b> sets of lashes, <b>one</b> set <b>due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these <b>shall he not take”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), <b>and one</b> set <b>due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: “And <b>he shall not profane”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), since he profanes the woman with whom he engages in intercourse. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him also be flogged</b> with a third set of lashes <b>due to</b> the complete phrase: <b>“He shall not profane his offspring,”</b> because the offspring resulting from that act of intercourse is a <i>ḥalal</i>. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a situation <b>where he did not complete his</b> act of sexual <b>intercourse.</b> Since this act does not lead to pregnancy, he is not flogged for profaning his offspring. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | a prohibition: | Sanhedrin 18b:14 | § The mishna teaches that the High Priest <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with his brother’s widow <b>and</b> his brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with his wife, but in any case he does not consummate levirate marriage with his brother’s wife. The Gemara comments: The mishna <b>categorically teaches</b> that the High Priest does not consummate levirate marriage, and there <b>is no difference</b> whether his brother’s wife was a widow <b>from betrothal</b> alone <b>and no difference</b> whether she was a widow <b>from a marriage</b> that had been consummated. <b>Granted,</b> it is understood that he does not consummate levirate marriage with a widow <b>from marriage,</b> since <b>there is</b> both <b>a positive mitzva:</b> “And he shall take a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13), <b>and</b> also <b>a prohibition:</b> “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take” (Leviticus 21:14), |
| Leviticus 21:14 | prohibition | Yevamot 20a:17 | <b>Granted,</b> she certainly may not enter into levirate marriage if she is a widow <b>from marriage,</b> since she is forbidden to the High Priest by the <b>positive mitzva</b> stated in the verse: “And he shall take a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13), <b>and</b> by the <b>prohibition</b> stated in the verse: “A widow, or one divorced…these he shall not take” (Leviticus 21:14). <b>And a positive mitzva,</b> levirate marriage, <b>does not override</b> both <b>a prohibition,</b> not marrying a widow, <b>and a positive mitzva,</b> marrying a virgin, together. <b>However,</b> if she is a widow <b>from betrothal,</b> then <b>there is only a prohibition,</b> as she is still a virgin. In that case, why not say that <b>the positive mitzva</b> of levirate marriage should <b>come and override the prohibition</b> against marrying a widow from betrothal? |
| Leviticus 21:14 | There it is different, as it is written: “He shall take for a wife” | Yevamot 59a:4 | Shmuel <b>said to him: This, too, you learned</b> in a mishna (61a): If <b>he betrothed a widow and was</b> subsequently <b>appointed to be High Priest, he may marry</b> her, despite the fact that a High Priest is prohibited from marrying a widow. This indicates that her permissibility to him is determined according to the time of the betrothal rather than the time of marriage. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as it is written: “He shall take for a wife”</b> (Leviticus 21:14). The superfluous expression “for a wife” indicates that he is permitted to marry the widow in this case. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | “A widow…he shall not take” | Yevamot 59a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a High Priest: <b>“A widow…he shall not take”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), which prohibits him from marrying any widow, <b>whether</b> she is <b>a widow from betrothal or a widow from marriage.</b> The Gemara is surprised by this statement: This is <b>obvious,</b> as the verse is referring to a widow without further specification. The Gemara answers: It is necessary; <b>lest you say that one should derive</b> a verbal analogy between the words <b>“widow”</b> and <b>“widow,”</b> based upon the usage of that term in a verse with regard to <b>Tamar,</b> Judah’s daughter-in-law (Genesis 38:11), as follows: <b>Just as there,</b> Tamar was a widow <b>from marriage, so too here</b> the verse is referring only to a widow <b>from marriage.</b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? As it is written: “A widow, or one divorced, or a ḥalala , or a zona , these shall he not take; but a virgin | Yevamot 60a:8 | <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? As it is written: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take; but a virgin</b> of his own people shall he take for a wife” (Leviticus 21:14), <b>and it states</b> subsequently: <b>“And he shall not profane his seed among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15). Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains that this profanation is referring <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., he profanes his seed by marrying any woman unfit for him, including a non-virgin. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | The verse states: “Shall he take for a wife” | Yevamot 61a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a priest <b>betrothed a widow and was</b> subsequently <b>appointed to be High Priest, that he may marry</b> her? <b>The verse states: “Shall he take for a wife”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), an inclusive phrase that indicates that he may marry her in this situation despite the general prohibition for a High Priest to marry a widow. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> should <b>also</b> be permitted to a High Priest. The Gemara answers: The word <b>“wife”</b> indicates that this does <b>not</b> include <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> who was not initially his wife but his brother’s. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | “A virgin | Yevamot 61b:12 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling applies specifically <b>to a High Priest, and it is</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“A virgin</b> of his own people shall he take for a wife [<i>isha</i>]” (Leviticus 21:14), one <b>might</b> have thought a High Priest may marry <b>a minor; the verse</b> therefore <b>states</b> that he must marry <b>a woman [<i>isha</i>],</b> i.e., an adult. <b>If</b> he must marry a <b>woman,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought it means <b>a grown woman. The verse</b> therefore <b>states</b> that he must marry <b>a virgin,</b> which excludes a grown woman, who is considered only a partial virgin because her hymen is not fully intact. <b>How so?</b> He must marry a woman who <b>has left the class of minority but</b> who <b>has not</b> yet <b>reached the class of grown womanhood,</b> i.e., he must marry a maiden. |
| Leviticus 21:14 | “But a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife” | Yevamot 77b:1 | <b>as Rabbi Zakkai taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> That which is stated with regard to a High Priest: <b>“But a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), comes <b>to include an established female convert,</b> one who was a convert from birth, i.e., who was born to a father and mother who converted after their marriage but prior to her birth, and this indicates <b>that she is fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood. And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I teach</b> that the words <b>“his own people”</b> and the more inclusive phrase <b>“of his own people”</b> come <b>to include a virgin who comes from two peoples,</b> from a union of converts hailing from two different peoples, <b>and you say</b> only <b>an established female convert and no more?</b> |
| Leviticus 21:15 | a widow to a High Priest, as the Torah said: “And he shall not profane [ yeḥallel ]” | Kiddushin 68a:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: From all</b> relationships that involve prohibitions, <b>Rabbi Akiva would render</b> the offspring <b>a <i>mamzer</i>, except for</b> the marriage of <b>a widow to a High Priest, as the Torah said: “And he shall not profane [<i>yeḥallel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), which teaches that <b>he renders them profane [<i>ḥillulim</i>],</b> i.e., his children from this marriage are <i>ḥalalim</i>, <b>but he does not render</b> them labeled with <b><i>mamzer</i> status.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:15 | it is stated here: “And he shall not profane his offspring among his people” | Kiddushin 77a:4 | The mishna teaches that in the case of <b>an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> his daughter is fit to marry into the priesthood. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> that <b>it is stated here: “And he shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), <b>and it is stated there: “He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:4): <b>Just as there</b> the prohibition against a priest contracting ritual impurity from a corpse applies to <b>males but not females; so too here,</b> with regard to the profanation of his offspring, where the term “among his people” is also employed, it is <b>males</b> who are rendered unfit and who render their daughters unfit to marry into the priesthood when they are <i>ḥalalim</i>, <b>but not females.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:15 | the verse states: “He shall not profane his offspring among his people” | Kiddushin 77a:8 | The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says: Just as the sons of Israel</b> are <b>a ritual bath of purity for <i>ḥalalot</i>,</b> i.e., the daughter of a <i>ḥalala</i> who marries an Israelite does not transmit her status of a <i>ḥalala</i>, and their daughters may marry priests, <b>so the daughters of Israel are a ritual bath of purity for <i>ḥalalim</i>,</b> and their daughters may marry priests. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “He shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), which teaches: <b>It is among one people that he profanes,</b> i.e., the offspring is a <i>ḥalal</i> only when he and his wife are both profaned, i.e., <i>ḥalalim</i>, but <b>among two peoples he does not profane.</b> If the mother is of a different people, i.e., not a <i>ḥalala</i>, the offspring is of unflawed lineage. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | his offspring are profaned, | Kiddushin 77b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? This repetition serves to teach that <b>a <i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only from a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood. Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>zona</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? <b>It is stated here: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), with regard to a High Priest, <b>and it is stated there: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:7), with regard to a common priest. <b>Just as here,</b> in the case of a High Priest who engages in sexual intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned,</b> in accordance with the verse: “And he shall not profane his offspring” (Leviticus 21:15), <b>so too there, in</b> the case of a common priest who engages in intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:15 | he shall not profane” | Kiddushin 78a:2 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says: A High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow is flogged two</b> sets of lashes, <b>one</b> set <b>due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these <b>shall he not take”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), <b>and one</b> set <b>due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: “And <b>he shall not profane”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), since he profanes the woman with whom he engages in intercourse. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him also be flogged</b> with a third set of lashes <b>due to</b> the complete phrase: <b>“He shall not profane his offspring,”</b> because the offspring resulting from that act of intercourse is a <i>ḥalal</i>. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a situation <b>where he did not complete his</b> act of sexual <b>intercourse.</b> Since this act does not lead to pregnancy, he is not flogged for profaning his offspring. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | “And he shall not profane his offspring among his people” | Kiddushin 78a:9 | <b>And</b> conversely, <b>Rava concedes in</b> the case of <b>a High Priest with a widow, that if he engaged in sexual intercourse without betrothing</b> her, <b>he is flogged</b> for the act of intercourse, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), <b>and he has profaned</b> her with his act of intercourse. <b>And they both concede in</b> the case of the prohibition with regard to <b>one who remarries his divorcée that if he engaged in intercourse</b> with her <b>without betrothing</b> her <b>he is not flogged,</b> because <b>the Torah forbade</b> them to reestablish their union only <b>through the manner of taking,</b> i.e., betrothal, but it did not prohibit the act of intercourse on its own. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | “And he shall not disqualify his offspring among his people” | Sotah 23b:3 | The mishna states: The <b>daughter of a priest can become disqualified</b> from marrying a priest and from partaking of <i>teruma</i> by engaging in sexual intercourse with someone forbidden to her, but <b>a priest does not become desacralized</b> by engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman forbidden to him. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a priest who marries a woman forbidden to him: <b>“And he shall not disqualify his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), indicating that <b>his offspring</b> from forbidden intercourse <b>are desacralized, but he is not</b> personally <b>desacralized</b> through his actions. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | he shall not disqualify his offspring | Sotah 26b:4 | The Gemara asks with regard to Shmuel’s statement that a <i>shaḥuf</i> who engages in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a priest <b>disqualifies</b> her <b>from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>: Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that a <i>shaḥuf</i> does not disqualify the daughter of a priest from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah with regard to a priest: “And <b>he shall not disqualify his offspring</b> among his people” (Leviticus 21:15). One might infer from this verse that one <b>who</b> can <b>have offspring disqualifies</b> a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, through forbidden sexual intercourse, and that one <b>who cannot have offspring does not disqualify</b> a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. Shmuel therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. In any event, Shmuel states that one can issue a warning on account of a <i>shaḥuf</i>, unlike the initial interpretation of the mishna. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | because the verse states: “And he shall not profane his seed | Temurah 29b:19 | <b>And</b> Abaye further stated with regard to a gentile prostitute: <b>A priest who engaged in intercourse with her is not flogged for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> the prohibition with regard to priests: “They shall not take a woman who is <b>a prostitute”</b> (Leviticus 21:7). <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the verse states: “And he shall not profane his seed</b> among his people” (Leviticus 21:15). This verse indicates that the prohibition of profaning his seed applies only to a priest who engages in intercourse with a woman <b>whose offspring are attributed to him,</b> i.e., a Jew, where the lineage of the children is determined by the identity of the father. This <b>excludes</b> a priest who engaged in intercourse with <b>a gentile woman, whose offspring are not attributed to him,</b> but to her, as their child is a gentile. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | “And he shall not profane his seed among his people” | Yevamot 60a:8 | <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? As it is written: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take; but a virgin</b> of his own people shall he take for a wife” (Leviticus 21:14), <b>and it states</b> subsequently: <b>“And he shall not profane his seed among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15). Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains that this profanation is referring <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., he profanes his seed by marrying any woman unfit for him, including a non-virgin. |
| Leviticus 21:15 | “He shall not profane his seed among his people” | Yevamot 69a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, a <i>ḥalal</i>, who was not excluded at the outset,</b> as he may marry even the daughter of a priest, <b>should not disqualify</b> a woman from marrying into the priesthood. The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to a priest who marries a woman unfit for the priesthood: <b>“He shall not profane his seed among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), thereby <b>juxtaposing his seed to him. Just as he,</b> a priest who married a woman forbidden to him, <b>disqualifies</b> her from the priesthood, <b>so too, his seed,</b> the <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>also disqualifies</b> a woman with whom he engaged in intercourse. |
| Leviticus 21:17 | “Any man of your descendants throughout their generations | Chullin 24b:8 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Any man of your descendants throughout their generations</b> that has a blemish shall not approach to offer the bread of his God” (Leviticus 21:17); <b>from here Rabbi Elazar says: A minor</b> priest is <b>unfit for</b> Temple <b>service, even</b> if he is <b>unblemished,</b> as he is not a man. <b>From when</b> is <b>he fit for service? From</b> the time he reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs. But his brethren the priests do not allow him to perform the service until he is twenty</b> years of <b>age.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:18 | a ḥarum | Bekhorot 43b:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When it is stated that <b>a <i>ḥarum</i></b> is considered a blemished priest (Leviticus 21:18), this is referring to a priest <b>whose nose is sunk.</b> If <b>his nose retreats,</b> i.e., it is very short and contracted upward, or if <b>his nose</b> is <b>blocked,</b> or if <b>his nose</b> is so long that it <b>droops, from where</b> is it derived that he is considered blemished? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Or a <i>ḥarum</i>.”</b> The term “or” serves to include all blemishes of the nose. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: A <i>ḥarum</i> is only one who</b> can <b>paint both of his eyes as one. They said to him: You have gone</b> too <b>far</b> in limiting your definition of a <i>ḥarum</i>. |
| Leviticus 21:19 | “Broken-footed” | Bekhorot 45a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse that states: <b>“Broken-footed”</b> (Leviticus 21:19), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a broken leg</b> disqualifies a priest from performing the Temple service. <b>From where</b> do I derive <b>to include</b> that <b>the <i>kishan</i>,</b> i.e., one who knocks his ankles or his knees together; <b>the <i>ikkel</i>; and the <i>kilvan</i></b> are disqualified as well? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Or broken-footed.”</b> The term “or” serves to include all blemishes of the leg. It was also <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>ba’al hakippin</i> and the <i>shufnar</i></b> are blemished. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A <i>ba’al happikin</i></b> is one <b>who has large protuberances</b> on his leg, while <b>a <i>shufnar</i></b> is one <b>who has no protuberances at all.</b> |
| Leviticus 21:19 | “Broken-handed” | Bekhorot 45a:6 | The mishna further teaches that a priest <b>whose fingers</b> or toes <b>are configured one upon the other, or</b> whose fingers or toes are <b>attached,</b> is likewise disqualified from performing the Temple service. But if they were attached from the hand or foot from above the palm of the hand or the bottom of the foot until the middle joint, or if they were attached below the joint, higher up on the finger or toe, and he cut to separate them, he is fit. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Broken-handed”</b> (Leviticus 21:19). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a broken hand</b> disqualifies a priest. |
| Leviticus 21:20 | it is not called simply: Their eyes. | Bekhorot 38b:9 | <b>Rav says: What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei? As it is written: “Their eyes stand forth from fatness”</b> (Psalms 73:7), which is interpreted to mean that the wicked embark on an evil path due to the fatness in the eyes, which is in the white portion. This indicates that the white portion <b>is called the fat of the eye,</b> but <b>it is not called simply: Their eyes.</b> Conversely, a <i>tevallul</i> is considered a blemish only if it is in the eye itself, as it states: “Or <i>tevallul</i> in his eye” (Leviticus 21:20). The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Meir, what is his reason?</b> The Gemara answers that Rabbi Meir would explain as follows: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the <b>expression <i>tevallul</i>?</b> It is <b>a substance that mixes [<i>hamevalbel</i>]</b> within <b>the eyes,</b> i.e., which passes through the white and the black in any fashion. |
| Leviticus 21:20 | As the Sages taught | Bekhorot 44a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to blemishes that disqualify priests: “Or a cataract or a <i>tevallul</i> in his eye” (Leviticus 21:20). Since it is obvious that a cataract or a <i>tevallul</i> can occur only in one’s eyes, why does the verse state: In his eye? The term <b>“in his eye”</b> indicates that <b>any</b> blemish <b>that is in his eye</b> disqualifies him from performing the Temple service. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated:</b> If <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>below</b> or <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>above,</b> or if <b>one of his eyes</b> is <b>above and one of his eyes</b> is <b>below,</b> or if <b>he sees the room and the upper story as one, or</b> if <b>when he speaks with his friend another</b> person <b>says: He is looking at me,</b> he is blemished and is disqualified from performing the Temple service. |
| Leviticus 21:20 | “Or crookbacked [ gibben ] or a dwarf” | Megillah 29a:10 | <b>Bar Kappara interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Why do you look askance [<i>teratzdun</i>], O high-peaked mountains,</b> at the mountain that God has desired for His abode” (Psalms 68:17)? <b>A Divine Voice issued forth and said to</b> all the mountains that came and demanded that the Torah be given upon them: <b>Why do you seek [<i>tirtzu</i>]</b> to enter into <b>a legal dispute [<i>din</i>] with</b> Mount <b>Sinai? You are all blemished in comparison to</b> Mount <b>Sinai,</b> as <b>it is written here: “High-peaked [<i>gavnunnim</i>]” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the blemishes that disqualify a priest: <b>“Or crookbacked [<i>gibben</i>] or a dwarf”</b> (Leviticus 21:20). <b>Rav Ashi said: Learn from</b> this that <b>one who is arrogant is</b> considered <b>blemished.</b> The other mountains arrogantly insisted that the Torah should be given upon them, and they were therefore described as blemished. |
| Leviticus 21:21 | the verse states: “No man among the seed of Aaron the priest who has a blemish | Bekhorot 43a:22 | § The mishna teaches that <b>in addition to those</b> blemishes that disqualify an animal, there are other blemishes that apply <b>to a person</b> despite the fact that they are not actual defects. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “No man among the seed of Aaron the priest who has a blemish</b> shall come forward to sacrifice the offerings of the Lord made by fire” (Leviticus 21:21). The verse indicates that the priest must be <b>a man who is equal among the seed of Aaron,</b> i.e., one whose appearance is similar to the other priests. |
| Leviticus 21:22 | “He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most sacred, and of the sacred” | Zevachim 101b:16 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a blemished priest: <b>“He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most sacred, and of the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 21:22). <b>If offerings of the most sacred order are stated,</b> that a blemished priest may eat them, then <b>why</b> are <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> also <b>stated? And if offerings of lesser sanctity are stated, why</b> are <b>offerings of the most sacred order stated?</b> |
| Leviticus 21:23 | as it is written: “He has a blemish; that he not profane | Bekhorot 43b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> a priest disqualified from performing the Temple service due to a full-fledged <b>blemish</b> that disqualifies both people and animals, and a priest disqualified from performing the Temple service because <b>he is not equal among the seed of Aaron?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There is</b> a difference between them <b>with regard to profaning</b> the Temple <b>service.</b> A priest with a full-fledged <b>blemish</b> who performs rites in the Temple <b>profanes</b> the <b>service</b> he has performed, <b>as it is written: “He has a blemish; that he not profane</b> My Sanctuaries” (Leviticus 21:23). A priest <b>who is not equal among the seed of Aaron</b> does <b>not profane</b> the <b>service</b> he performs. |
| Leviticus 21:23 | “Only he shall not go in unto the veil, | Eruvin 105a:5 | <b>Rav Huna said: Rav Kahana,</b> who was a priest, <b>supports priests</b> by emphasizing their special sanctity. <b>As Rav Kahana taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to a priest who has a physical blemish, <b>“Only he shall not go in unto the veil,</b> nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish, that he profane not My holy places; for I am the Lord who sanctifies them” (Leviticus 21:23), I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>priests with blemishes</b> may <b>not enter</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar to manufacture beaten plates</b> of gold for the Holy of Holies. |
| Leviticus 21:23 | as it is written: “But he shall not come into the curtain | Sanhedrin 84a:6 | § The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>a blemished</b> priest who performs the Temple service, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and the Rabbis say:</b> He is liable only <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? It is <b>as it is written: “But he shall not come into the curtain</b> and he shall not approach the altar as he has a blemish, that he desecrate not My sacred places” (Leviticus 21:23). <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the punishment by means of a verbal analogy: The meaning of the term of <b>desecration</b> written with regard to a blemished priest who performs the Temple service is derived <b>from</b> the term of <b>desecration</b> written with regard to an impure priest who partakes of <b><i>teruma</i>. Just as there,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>, he is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a blemished priest who performs the Temple service, he is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven. |
| Leviticus 22:1 | “And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying [ lemor ]” | Temurah 7b:5 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that he has transgressed <b>a prohibition as well? As it is stated</b> at the beginning of that passage: <b>“And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying [<i>lemor</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 22:1). This <b>teaches that</b> every mitzva stated in <b>the passage is</b> considered <b>a prohibition.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:2 | “That they shall separate themselves | Sanhedrin 83b:11 | <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> written with regard to the <b>matter of an impure</b> priest <b>who performed</b> the Temple <b>service, as</b> that <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived for us from</b> the verse: <b>“That they shall separate themselves</b> from the sacred items of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 22:2), then <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day who performed</b> the Temple <b>service.</b> Although he is no longer impure in every sense, the priest remains impure in terms of the prohibitions of partaking of <i>teruma</i> and sacrificial food, and of entering the Temple. |
| Leviticus 22:2 | and they shall not desecrate My sacred name: | Sanhedrin 83b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The punishment for <b>an impure</b> priest <b>who performed</b> the Temple <b>service</b> is death at the hand of Heaven. The source for this is explained: <b>As Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin asked of Rav Yosef: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an impure</b> priest <b>who performed</b> the Temple <b>service is</b> punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven? Rav Yosef answered: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> in the context of admonishing priests to avoid impurity: <b>“Speak to Aaron and his sons that they shall separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel</b> that they sanctify to Me, <b>and they shall not desecrate My sacred name:</b> I am the Lord” (Leviticus 22:2). |
| Leviticus 22:2 | name” | Temurah 3a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> if one consumes <b>them,</b> i.e., animals consecrated by gentiles, <b>one is not liable for</b> committing a transgression, <b>with regard to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> consuming offerings while <b>ritually impure.</b> The source for this is a verse, <b>as it is written with regard to ritual impurity: “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy items of the children of Israel,</b> which they hallow unto Me, <b>and that they profane not</b> My holy <b>name”</b> (Leviticus 22:2). This verse explicitly mentions items consecrated by the children of Israel, to emphasize that the <i>halakha</i> of distancing oneself from consecrated items while in a state of ritual impurity does not include items consecrated by gentiles. |
| Leviticus 22:2 | “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel [ benei Yisrael ]” | Zevachim 15b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a non-priest</b> who performs sacrificial rites disqualifies an offering? <b>As Levi teaches:</b> The verse states: <b>“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel [<i>benei Yisrael</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 22:2). Levi continues: <b>“The children of Israel”</b> serves <b>to exclude what</b> from the prohibition against sacrificing an offering in a state of impurity? <b>If we say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> the offerings of <b>women,</b> and the verse states “<i>benei</i>” in the masculine to indicate sons but not daughters, is it conceivable that <b>an offering of women is sacrificed in</b> a state of <b>impurity?</b> |
| Leviticus 22:2 | that they separate themselves | Zevachim 16a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> a non-priest <b>is prohibited</b> from performing sacrificial rites? <b>If</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, <b>that they separate themselves</b> from the sacred items of the children of Israel, and that they not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2), then the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is unnecessary, since <b>profanation itself is writ-ten in</b> the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “Keep the charge of the Tent of Meeting, whatever the service of the Tent may be; <b>but a common man shall not draw close to you”</b> (Numbers 18:4). |
| Leviticus 22:2 | “That they separate themselves | Zevachim 17a:3 | <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> written with regard to the <b>matter of an impure</b> priest who performed the Temple service, <b>as</b> that <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived for us from</b> the verse: <b>“That they separate themselves</b> from the sacred items of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 22:2), then <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day</b> who performed the Temple service. Although he is no longer impure in every sense, the priest remains impure in the sense that he is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i> and sacrificial food, and from entering the Temple. |
| Leviticus 22:2 | which they consecrate to Me, | Zevachim 44a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include bird</b> offerings, e.g., doves or pigeons, which are not slaughtered but whose napes of their necks are pinched, <b>and meal offerings, until I include</b> even the <b><i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper? The verse states</b> with regard to the consumption of consecrated food in a state of ritual purity: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel, <b>which they consecrate to Me,</b> and that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2). |
| Leviticus 22:2 | which they consecrate to Me, | Zevachim 45b:10 | Therefore, <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to eating consecrated foods in a state of ritual impurity: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel, <b>which they consecrate to Me,</b> and that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2). This teaches that a ritually impure person is liable for eating any item that has been consecrated. |
| Leviticus 22:2 | Levi taught | Zevachim 45b:17 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>notar</i> is derived <b>from that</b> which <b>Levi taught</b> with regard to the verse: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they consecrate to Me, and that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2), which is referring to the eating of consecrated food in a state of ritual impurity. <b>As Levi taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the verse is speaking even of a disqualification</b> caused by <b>time,</b> and not only ritual impurity? <b>The verse states</b> profanation elsewhere: <b>“And they shall not profane the sacred items of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). |
| Leviticus 22:2 | which they consecrate to Me” | Zevachim 45b:4 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: If that is so,</b> with regard to the verse discussing ritually impure priests and consecrated items: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel, <b>which they consecrate to Me”</b> (Leviticus 22:2), <b>so too,</b> would Rabbi Yosei say that the prohibition against eating consecrated items in a state of ritual impurity applies only to offerings which <b>they,</b> the Jews, consecrate, <b>and not</b> to those of <b>gentiles?</b> This cannot be, as Rabbi Yosei explicitly states in the <i>baraita</i> that in this regard the offerings of gentiles are like those of Jews. |
| Leviticus 22:3 | Rabba raised an objection | Bava Batra120a:7 | <b>Rabba raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> taught concerning the prohibition against eating consecrated foods while in a state of ritual impurity. Moses was commanded: “Say to them: Whoever will be of all your descendants throughout your generations, who approaches to the holy things, which the children of Israel consecrate to the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me” (Leviticus 22:3). Which people are referred to in the phrase <b>“say to them”?</b> It is referring <b>to those standing at Mount Sinai.</b> Which people are referred to in the phrase <b>“throughout your generations”? These are the coming generations. If</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is stated</b> to <b>the fathers, why is</b> it <b>stated</b> to <b>the sons; and if</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is stated</b> to <b>the sons, why is</b> it <b>stated</b> to <b>the fathers?</b> This is <b>because there are</b> mitzvot <b>for the fathers that are not for the sons, and there are</b> mitzvot <b>for the sons that are not for the fathers.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:3 | the verse states: “Say to them: Anyone of all your seed throughout your generations, that approaches | Meilah 10b:4 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Say to them: Anyone of all your seed throughout your generations, that approaches</b> the sacred items, which the children of Israel consecrate to the Lord, while his impurity is on him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me: I am the Lord” (Leviticus 22:3). <b>The verse,</b> which deals with eating while ritually impure, <b>is speaking of all the sacred items,</b> whether or not they have a permitting factor. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they should be liable for</b> eating <b>them immediately,</b> as soon as they have been verbally consecrated, even before they have been placed into a service vessel. <b>The verse states: “That approaches</b> the sacred items.” This clause is puzzling, as it apparently leads to the unlikely conclusion that liability applies after one has touched the item. |
| Leviticus 22:3 | approaches | Zevachim 45b:11 | One <b>might</b> have thought that one is liable for eating sacred items <b>immediately</b> after they have been consecrated. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Whoever he is of all your seed among your generations that <b>approaches</b> the sacred items” (Leviticus 22:3), and <b>Rabbi Elazar said,</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>But is there</b> one who merely <b>touches,</b> i.e., approaches, consecrated items, <b>who is liable?</b> Only one who eats consecrated food while in a state of ritual impurity is liable. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | semen: “Or a man | Bava Batra9b:4 | Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: But from where do we</b> derive that the carcass of <b>a creeping animal renders a person impure?

| Leviticus 22:4 | is emitted” | Bava Kamma25b:11 | The Gemara answers: The terms “garment” and “leather,” as stated <b>with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, are also free.

| Leviticus 22:4 | is emitted” | Bava Kamma25b:8 | The Gemara affirms: <b>Indeed,</b> the terms <b>are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms “garment” and “leather” are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“Or a man who touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5); <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it</b> shall be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17), since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | it is with regard to a person that it is written: “Any man from the offspring of Aaron” | Bekhorot 3b:7 | The reason for the latter <i>halakha</i> is that <b>it is with regard to a person that it is written: “Any man from the offspring of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), which indicates <b>that we require a man who is equal to the seed of Aaron,</b> i.e., he has an ordinary appearance like other priests; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>an animal,</b> if <b>both</b> eyes <b>are big</b> or <b>both</b> eyes <b>are small, it is also not a blemish.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:4 | with regard to a person that it is written: “Whatever man of the seed of Aaron” | Bekhorot 40b:2 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the blemishes of <b>a person that we learned</b> in a mishna (44a): If <b>his upper lip protrudes beyond the lower</b> lip <b>or</b> his <b>lower</b> lip <b>protrudes beyond the upper</b> lip, <b>that is a blemish.</b> And <b>it is</b> only <b>with regard to a person that it is written: “Whatever man of the seed of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), which teaches that in order to be fit for the Temple service a priest must be <b>a man who is equal to the seed of Aaron,</b> i.e., he has an ordinary appearance like other priests. <b>But</b> this requirement is <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to an animal,</b> and therefore an animal should not be considered blemished if its lower lip protrudes beyond the upper lip. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | “Any man [ ish ish ] | Chagigah 4b:3 | <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>the uncircumcised, from where do we</b> derive that he is exempt? The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> so <b>that the uncircumcised</b> is included in the same category <b>as the ritually impure. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says,</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the seed of Aaron that is a leper or has an issue; he shall not eat of the sacred things” (Leviticus 22:4), the double use of the term: “Ish,” comes <b>to include the uncircumcised.</b> Like the ritually impure, the uncircumcised may neither eat sacrificial meat nor bring offerings to the Temple. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | “Any man from the descendants of Aaron who is leprous or a zav | Makkot 14b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Reish Lakish, from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive <b>a prohibition against</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i></b> in a state of impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that which is written: <b>“Any man from the descendants of Aaron who is leprous or a <i>zav</i></b> may not partake of the sacred food until he will be pure” (Leviticus 22:4). The phrase “descendants of Aaron” indicates that the prohibition applies to all descendants, including women. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is an item whose</b> status <b>is equal</b> with regard <b>to all descendants of Aaron,</b> as opposed to certain sacrificial foods that may be eaten only by males? <b>You must say it is <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is derived from this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> verse serves <b>to</b> prohibit <b>partaking</b> of <i>teruma</i> while impure; <b>and that</b> verse: “No consecrated item shall she touch,” serves <b>to</b> prohibit <b>touching</b> <i>teruma</i> while impure. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | with a sliver of wood, what is | Niddah 22a:4 | § <b>Rabba asked Rav Huna</b> a similar question to the case of the tube: With regard to a man <b>who sees semen</b> by extracting it from his penis <b>with a sliver of wood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he assume the impurity status of one who experiences a seminal emission? The Gemara explains the question. The verse states: “A man from whom the flow of semen emerges” (Leviticus 22:4). Since <b>the Merciful One states: “From whom,”</b> is it derived that the man is not impure <b>unless</b> the semen <b>emerges from his flesh</b> by itself, <b>and not</b> when it is extracted <b>with a sliver of wood? Or perhaps</b> from <b>this</b> term: <b>“From whom,”</b> it is derived merely that the man is not impure <b>unless his impurity,</b> i.e., his semen, <b>emerges outside</b> his body, <b>but</b> he is impure <b>even</b> if this is achieved <b>with a sliver of wood.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:4 | it is already stated below | Niddah 41b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her? But isn’t it taught</b> to the contrary in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, <b>they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening”</b> (Leviticus 15:18). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: And what does this</b> verse <b>come to teach us? If</b> it teaches <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>comes into contact with semen</b> that they are impure, <b>it is already stated below</b> (Leviticus 22:4): <b>“Or a man</b> from whom the flow of seed goes out,” from which it is derived that coming into contact with semen renders one impure. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | “Or from whoever the flow of seed goes out” | Niddah 43b:25 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: From where</b> do you infer <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the impurity of one who touches semen <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“or whoever”</b> that is stated with regard to the impurity <b>of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal? Perhaps he derives it from</b> the previous verse: <b>“Or from whoever the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and everyone</b> agrees that when a <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse dealing with the same matter, one should <b>infer from it and</b> derive the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well. If so, the amount of semen that imparts impurity by contact should be derived from the amount that renders the one who emitted it impure, which is any amount. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | man from whom semen is emitted” | Shabbat 64a:17 | <b>Indeed [<i>la’ei</i>], they are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms garment and leather are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity from contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity from contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And whoever touches anything that is impure by the dead or a <b>man from whom semen is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> is the verse: <b>“Or whoever touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5). <b>And it is written</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of</b> the ritual impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and every hide on which the semen is</b> must be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17). Since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other. Consequently, the words <b>garment and leather, which the Torah wrote with regard to a creeping animal, why do I need</b> them? The relevant <i>halakha</i> could be derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of seminal impurity. <b>Learn from it</b> that garment and leather were mentioned <b>to render them free.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:4 | corpse are also free. Now, since a corpse is juxtaposed with semen, as it is written: “And whoever touches anything that is impure by the dead or a man whose semen is emitted from him” | Shabbat 64a:19 | The Gemara answers: Garment and leather stated <b>with regard to</b> impurity imparted by a <b>corpse are also free. Now, since a corpse is juxtaposed with semen, as it is written: “And whoever touches anything that is impure by the dead or a man whose semen is emitted from him”</b> (Leviticus 22:4); <b>and it is stated with regard to semen: “And every garment and every hide”</b> (Leviticus 15:17); the terms <b>garment and leather, which the Torah wrote with regard to</b> ritual impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, why do I</b> need them? <b>Learn from it</b> that they are mentioned in order <b>to render them free.</b> These terms are extraneous in their context, and were written for the purpose of the verbal analogy with the <i>halakhot</i> of creeping animals. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | states: “Any man [ ish ish ] | Yevamot 70a:16 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This proof <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a <i>zav</i> shall not eat of the holy things until he be pure” (Leviticus 22:4). The repetition of the word <i>ish</i>, meaning man, comes <b>to include an uncircumcised</b> man, indicating that he is like one who is ritually impure and therefore may not partake of consecrated food. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | says: “Any man [ ish ish ] | Yevamot 71a:5 | <b>The Master said</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it <b>is not necessary</b> to derive by way of a verbal analogy the <i>halakha</i> that an uncircumcised priest may not eat <i>teruma</i>, <b>as</b> the verse <b>says: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a <i>zav</i> shall not eat of the holy things” (Leviticus 22:4). The repetition of the word <i>ish</i> comes <b>to include an uncircumcised</b> man and indicate that he too may not partake of consecrated food. The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that the verse comes <b>to include an acute mourner</b> in the prohibition against eating <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The verse states: “No foreigner</b> may eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10), which indicates: A disqualification stemming from <b>foreignness I told you</b> prevents one from eating <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not</b> a disqualification based on <b>acute mourning.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:4 | “Any man | Yevamot 72b:12 | <b>Rav Yosef said: This <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who disqualifies one who is uncircumcised from sanctifying the purification waters, <b>is a <i>tanna</i> from the school of Rabbi Akiva, who includes the uncircumcised</b> in the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> that which governs <b>the ritually impure. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the words “any man” in the verse <b>“Any man</b> from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a <i>zav</i> shall not eat of the holy things until he be pure” (Leviticus 22:4), come <b>to include</b> one who is <b>uncircumcised,</b> and it is prohibited for him as well to partake of consecrated food. And so too, with regard to other matters as well, e.g., sanctifying the purification waters, one who is uncircumcised has the same status as one who is ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: The verse states: “Any man from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a zav | Yevamot 74a:19 | § It is taught in the mishna that <b>all</b> those <b>who are ritually impure</b> with any type of ritual impurity may not eat <i>teruma</i>.

| Leviticus 22:4 | “Any man | Yevamot 74a:8 | The Gemara rejects this argument: No proof can be adduced from here, as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> was <b>taught</b> by a <i>tanna</i> <b>from the school of Rabbi Akiva, who includes an uncircumcised</b> man in the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> that which governs one who is <b>ritually impure.

| Leviticus 22:4 | until he be pure” | Yevamot 75a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>three verses with regard to <i>teruma</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They are</b> all <b>necessary, as, had</b> <i>teruma</i> been derived solely from the verse: “He shall not eat of the holy things <b>until he be pure”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>I would not have known by what</b> means ritual purity is achieved, whether by immersion alone or in some other way. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “And when the sun has set he shall be pure,</b> and afterward he may eat from the holy things” (Leviticus 22:7), to teach that he must also wait for sunset. |
| Leviticus 22:4 | the verse | Yevamot 75a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to that <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael and says</b> that <b>the verse</b> “Any man from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a <i>zav</i> shall not eat of the holy things until he be pure” (Leviticus 22:4) <b>is speaking of a <i>zav</i> who</b> already experienced <b>three sightings</b> of an emission, <b>and of a confirmed leper,</b> both of whom must bring an offering as part of their purification process; <b>and,</b> this being the case, <b>that</b> phrase <b>“until he be pure”</b> must mean <b>until he brings</b> his <b>atonement</b> offering; then <b>why do I</b> need <b>two verses with regard to sacrificial food,</b> this verse and the verse with regard to a woman after childbirth: “And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be pure” (Leviticus 12:8), to teach us that sacrificial food may not be eaten until after the atonement offering has been brought? |
| Leviticus 22:5 | a creeping animal: “Or a man who touches any creeping animal, | Bava Batra9b:4 | Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: But from where do we</b> derive that the carcass of <b>a creeping animal renders a person impure?

| Leviticus 22:5 | “Or a man who touches any creeping animal | Bava Kamma25b:8 | The Gemara affirms: <b>Indeed,</b> the terms <b>are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms “garment” and “leather” are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“Or a man who touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5); <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it</b> shall be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17), since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other. |
| Leviticus 22:5 | “Or whoever | Niddah 43b:21 | § <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The amount of semen which imparts impurity to one who touches it is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the Torah <b>includes one who touches semen,</b> in addition to one who emits semen, as impure? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal: <b>“Or whoever</b> touches any creeping animal, whereby he may become impure” (Leviticus 22:5). It is inferred from the inclusive phrase “or whoever” that one who touches semen is also impure. |
| Leviticus 22:5 | from any impurity that he has” | Niddah 55a:3 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And the flesh of a corpse</b> transmits impurity both when moist and when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this is as <b>the verse states:</b> “Or whoever touches any creeping thing by which he may be made impure, or a man from whom he may be made impure, <b>from any impurity that he has”</b> (Leviticus 22:5). The term “from any” is an amplification, indicating that one may become impure <b>from any impurities that come from</b> a dead person, whether they are moist or dry. |
| Leviticus 22:5 | “Or whoever touches any creeping animal | Shabbat 64a:17 | <b>Indeed [<i>la’ei</i>], they are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms garment and leather are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity from contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity from contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And whoever touches anything that is impure by the dead or a <b>man from whom semen is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> is the verse: <b>“Or whoever touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5). <b>And it is written</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of</b> the ritual impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and every hide on which the semen is</b> must be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17). Since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other. Consequently, the words <b>garment and leather, which the Torah wrote with regard to a creeping animal, why do I need</b> them? The relevant <i>halakha</i> could be derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of seminal impurity. <b>Learn from it</b> that garment and leather were mentioned <b>to render them free.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:6 | explicitly written: “A soul that touches it shall be impure until the evening and shall not eat of the consecrated food” | Makkot 19b:5 | Before citing the source of the prohibition, the Gemara asks: With regard to one with <b>impurity of the body</b> who partakes of second-tithe produce, it is <b>explicitly written: “A soul that touches it shall be impure until the evening and shall not eat of the consecrated food”</b> (Leviticus 22:6), which the Sages interpret to include second-tithe produce. This is a prohibition with regard to a ritually impure person partaking of second-tithe produce. <b>But</b> when Rabbi Shimon says: I do not know where it is that one is warned with regard to eating, he is stating: With regard to <b>the impurity of</b> the second-tithe produce <b>itself, from where</b> is the warning derived? |
| Leviticus 22:6 | “The soul that touches it shall be impure until the evening, and he shall not eat from the holy things unless he has washed his flesh in water” | Yevamot 73b:6 | The <i>tanna</i> adds: <b>And where one is</b> actually <b>warned against eating</b> second tithe in a state of impurity, this <b>I do not know.</b> Although it is obvious from the verse that this is prohibited, the source for the prohibition is unclear. The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: The prohibition against eating second tithe when one is in a state of <b>ritual impurity of the body</b> is <b>explicitly written,</b> as it is stated with regard to the ritual impurity imparted by a creeping animal: <b>“The soul that touches it shall be impure until the evening, and he shall not eat from the holy things unless he has washed his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 22:6). This is referring to second tithe, as will be explained later (74b). |
| Leviticus 22:6 | soul | Yevamot 74b:11 | <b>Rava said:</b> Even <b>without</b> the rationale that the punishment of <b>death is a greater</b> stringency, <b>you still could not say</b> that the first verse that speaks only of immersion is referring to <i>teruma</i>.

The verse indicates that only <b>those</b> birds <b>that are forbidden</b> specifically <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., kosher birds that died without ritual slaughter, cause impurity in this manner. This serves to <b>exclude</b> any bird <b>that is not forbidden due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> but <b>rather due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat a non-kosher</b> bird. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the prohibition of eating a carcass does not take effect with regard to a non-kosher bird, because it is already subject to a different prohibition. |
| Leviticus 22:8 | is written explicitly | Chullin 140a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this kosher bird whose prohibition must be derived from this verse? <b>If</b> it is a bird <b>with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> that would be superfluous, as that <b>is written explicitly</b> in the verse: “An unslaughtered animal carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat” (Leviticus 22:8). <b>And if</b> it is referring <b>to the slaughtered</b> bird from the purification ritual <b>of a leper,</b> which is prohibited for consumption despite being kosher, that would also be superfluous, since it <b>is derived from the latter clause of the verse</b> in Deuteronomy, as the verse states: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), which serves <b>to include the slaughtered</b> bird <b>of the leper.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:8 | the verse states: “That which dies of itself, or is torn of animals, he shall not eat to render himself impure through it” | Niddah 42b:15 | Abaye and Rava disagree with regard to this issue as well. <b>Abaye said: It is</b> considered <b>encapsulated, and Rava said: It is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body. <b>Abaye</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> that it is considered encapsulated? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an animal carcass should impart impurity to garments</b> when it is <b>in</b> one’s <b>throat,</b> like an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That which dies of itself, or is torn of animals, he shall not eat to render himself impure through it”</b> (Leviticus 22:8). |
| Leviticus 22:8 | “A carcass, or a tereifa , he shall not eat” | Zevachim 69b:17 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the carcass of a non-kosher bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b> But <b>the verse states,</b> concerning the impurity of carcasses of birds: <b>“A carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat”</b> (Leviticus 22:8). This type of impurity applies only to <b>those</b> birds <b>that are forbidden</b> specifically <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., kosher birds that died without ritual slaughter. <b>This</b> carcass of a non-kosher animal <b>is excluded,</b> and is not impure, <b>as</b> it is <b>forbidden not due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> but <b>rather due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat a non-kosher</b> bird, to render yourself impure with it. Consequently, the word <i>tereifa</i> in the aforementioned verse (Leviticus 17:15) teaches that a slaughtered <i>tereifa</i> imparts ritual impurity, as originally posited. |
| Leviticus 22:8 | tereifa is written | Zevachim 70a:11 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Another</b> instance of the word <b><i>tereifa</i> is written</b> concerning the ritual impurity of birds: “A carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat to become impure with it” (Leviticus 22:8). Rabbi Yehuda derives the <i>halakha</i> from this verse. |
| Leviticus 22:8 | “carcass” | Zevachim 70a:13 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive that the carcass of a non-kosher bird does not impart ritual impurity? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives it from</b> the word <b>“carcass”</b> in the verse: “A carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat to become impure with it” (Leviticus 22:8), which indicates that only carcasses of birds that are forbidden for consumption due to their status as a carcass are impure. Non-kosher birds are forbidden due to their non-kosher status, not due to their status as a carcass. |
| Leviticus 22:9 | “And die therein if they desecrate it” | Chullin 113b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Shmuel</b> really <b>maintain</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say in the name of Rabbi Elazar: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an impure priest who partakes of impure <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of produce designated for the priest, <b>is not</b> punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven as he would had the <i>teruma</i> been ritually pure? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated,</b> with regard to the prohibition of an impure priest partaking of <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And die therein if they desecrate it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), <b>to the exclusion of this</b> case of <i>teruma</i> that is impure, <b>which was already desecrated</b> before the priest ate it. Here, it seems, since impure <i>teruma</i> is already prohibited for consumption, the added prohibition of an impure priest partaking of <i>teruma</i> does not take effect. |
| Leviticus 22:9 | it is written: “They will die through it if they profane it” | Keritot 7a:7 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> oil, <b>it is written: “They will die through it if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and <b>since</b> the priest <b>has</b> already <b>profaned</b> the oil by using it, it is considered <b>profaned. But with regard to the anointing oil it is written: “For the consecration</b> of the anointing oil of <b>His God is upon him”</b> (Leviticus 21:12). <b>The Merciful One calls it anointing oil</b> even at this stage, to teach <b>that even though it is upon</b> the High Priest it is <b>not</b> considered <b>profaned,</b> and instead remains sacred. |
| Leviticus 22:9 | due to it” | Menachot 77b:23 | Rava elaborates: <b>Since</b> <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>is compared to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> perhaps <b>it is considered like <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> and the same penalties are incurred. <b>Or perhaps,</b> since the verse uses restrictive terms with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, as the verse states of one who intentionally partakes of it: “They shall die <b>due to it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and the verse states with regard to one who unwittingly partakes of it: “Then he shall put <b>its fifth-part</b> unto it” (Leviticus 22:14), <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> this <i>halakha</i> specifically to the case of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe. |
| Leviticus 22:9 | “And they shall keep my charge lest they bear a sin for it | Sanhedrin 83a:14 | The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that an impure priest who partook of pure <i>teruma</i></b> is liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven? It is derived <b>as Shmuel says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to an impure priest who partakes of pure <i>teruma</i> that</b> he is punished <b>with death at the hand of Heaven?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a priest who partakes of <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And they shall keep my charge lest they bear a sin for it</b> and die therein if they desecrate it: I am the Lord” (Leviticus 22:9). |
| Leviticus 22:9 | because of it | Sanhedrin 84a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> what is the reason that they hold that he is liable only for violating a prohibition? It is as <b>the verse states:</b> “And die <b>because of it</b> if they desecrate it; I am the Lord Who sanctifies them” (Leviticus 22:9), from which it is derived: <b>“Because of it”</b> they receive death at the hand of Heaven, <b>but not</b> in the case of <b>a blemished</b> priest. |
| Leviticus 22:9 | “And die therefore if they profane it” | Sanhedrin 90b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One who gives <i>teruma</i> to a priest who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>even causes</b> the priest’s <b>death, as it is stated</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And die therefore if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9). Priests who partake of <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual impurity profane it and are liable to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven. <b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught:</b> By giving <i>teruma</i> to a priest who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>one also brings upon him a sin of guilt,</b> i.e., a sin that will lead to additional sins, <b>as it is stated: “And so bring upon them a sin of guilt when they eat their sacred items”</b> (Leviticus 22:16). |
| Leviticus 22:9 | teruma : | Temurah 3a:4 | <b>What is the reason</b> that one is not liable for misuse? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to misuse of consecrated property: <b>“If anyone commit a trespass, and sin through error,</b> in the holy items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). <b>And we derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the use of the word <b>“sin”</b> in this verse and the word <b>“sin”</b> used in the context of <b><i>teruma</i>:</b> “They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it” (Leviticus 22:9). <b>And with regard to <i>teruma</i> it is written</b> explicitly: “Even of all the hallowed items of <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 18:8), from which one can infer: <b>But not</b> of <b>gentiles.</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of misuse as well, therefore, do not apply to animals consecrated by gentiles. |
| Leviticus 22:9 | the verse states: “They will die through it if they profane it” | Yevamot 86a:3 | The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “They will die through it if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and a different verse states: <b>“Then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto it”</b> (Leviticus 22:14). A close reading of these verses shows that the Torah is emphasizing that the death penalty comes <b>through it,</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>and not through tithes,</b> and that a fifth must be added <b>to it, but not to tithes.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir, how do they account for the comparison in the above verse? The Gemara answers: They would say it teaches that <b>just as</b> the requirement to separate <b><i>teruma</i> produces</b> the status of forbidden <b>untithed produce, so too</b> the requirement to separate the <b>first tithe also produces</b> the status of forbidden <b>untithed produce.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:10 | three | Keritot 4b:13 | <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states the following: The juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> for eating forbidden <b>fat</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes, two for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals and one for the prohibition of a non-priest partaking of sacrificial food, from the verse: “And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food” (Leviticus 22:10), <b>so too,</b> for eating <b>blood</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes. |
| Leviticus 22:10 | “And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food” | Keritot 4b:4 | <b>Rav Sheizevi said to Rava: Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, this is</b> the meaning of the three <b>verses that are written: “It shall be a perpetual statute</b> throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17); <b>“You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23); <b>“And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food”</b> (Leviticus 22:10), as <b>these</b> are <b>three prohibitions,</b> two for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals, as the two verses that mention fat are discussing sacrificial animals, and one for the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of consecrated food. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is their reasoning?</b> Why is one liable to receive only two sets of lashes? |
| Leviticus 22:10 | of items called kodesh , as it is written: “And no common man may eat of kodesh ” | Ketubot 25a:4 | The Gemara answers that <b>this is</b> what the verse <b>is saying: Neither</b> did they partake <b>of items called <i>kodesh</i>, as it is written: “And no common man may eat of <i>kodesh</i>”</b> (Leviticus 22:10), referring to <i>teruma</i>, <b>nor</b> did they partake <b>of items called <i>kodashim</i>, as it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man, she shall not eat of <i>terumat hakodashim</i>”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). <b>The Master said</b> that this means: <b>Of</b> that which is <b>set aside from the offerings [<i>kodashim</i>]</b> to the priests, i.e., the loaves of the thanks-offering and the breast and the shoulder, <b>they may not partake.</b> According to neither explanation can any proof be cited from the <i>baraita</i> as to whether or not one elevates from <i>teruma</i> or from the Priestly Benediction to lineage. |
| Leviticus 22:10 | a tenant and a hired worker. As it is taught | Kiddushin 4a:13 | Rabba cites an analogous case. This is <b>just as it is</b> with regard to <b>a tenant and a hired worker. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>teruma</i>: The verse states: “A tenant of a priest or a hired worker shall not eat of the consecrated” (Leviticus 22:10). <b>“A tenant”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave <b>who has been acquired as a permanent acquisition,</b> i.e., one who said he wishes to stay with his master. This Hebrew slave has his ear pierced and he remains with his master until the Jubilee Year. <b>“A hired worker”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> the standard period of servitude for a Hebrew slave. |
| Leviticus 22:10 | “No non-priest may eat of the sacred” | Kiddushin 69b:16 | The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the Tirshatha <b>is saying:</b> They may <b>not</b> partake of <b>anything that is called sacred [<i>kodesh</i>], nor anything that is called most sacred [<i>kodashim</i>].</b> The Gemara clarifies. The words <b>not anything that is called sacred</b> are referring to <i>teruma</i>, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“No non-priest may eat of the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 22:10). And the words <b>nor anything that is called most sacred</b> are referring to offerings, <b>as the verse states: “And a daughter of a priest, if she is married to a non-priest, she may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). <b>And the Master says:</b> What is the meaning of “that which is set apart from the sacred things”? It means <b>from</b> the portions <b>separated from the offerings,</b> i.e., the breast and thigh of a peace-offering, |
| Leviticus 22:10 | the prohibition of a non-priest | Menachot 74a:22 | § With regard to the prohibition against eating from certain offerings derived from the verse that states: “Shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten,” <b>Ravina asks:</b> In the case of <b>a priest who ate from the sacrificial portions, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? As to whether this priest violates <b>the prohibition of a non-priest</b> eating certain types of sacrificial meat, expressed in the verse: “No non-priest shall eat of the sacrificial meat” (Leviticus 22:10), |
| Leviticus 22:10 | teruma , as the Merciful One says: “No stranger shall eat of the sacred food; | Pesachim 23a:3 | The Gemara further challenges Rabbi Abbahu’s opinion: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition that a non-priest shall not eat <b><i>teruma</i>, as the Merciful One says: “No stranger shall eat of the sacred food;</b> a tenant of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the sacred food” (Leviticus 22:10). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> such as a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <b>on behalf of a nazirite with wine,</b> even though he may not drink it. <b>And</b> one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>on behalf of an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>,</b> although it is prohibited for him to eat it. Apparently, it is permitted for an Israelite to derive benefit from the <i>teruma</i> even though the verse says: “He shall not eat.” This appears to be a challenge to the opinion of Rabbi Abbahu. |
| Leviticus 22:10 | “No common man may eat of the sacred” | Yevamot 68a:13 | The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>If</b> the prohibition against the daughter of a priest who married a non-priest partaking of <i>teruma</i> had been derived only <b>from that</b> latter verse, <b>I would have said</b> that it is a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva, as it is stated in positive form, and according to the principle that <b>a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva is a positive mitzva,</b> she would not be liable to receive a court-imposed punishment. <b>The Merciful One</b> therefore <b>writes that</b> former verse, <b>to</b> establish an explicit <b>prohibition.</b> The Gemara counters: The <b>prohibition</b> against the wife of a non-priest partaking of <i>teruma</i> <b>is derived from</b> a different verse: <b>“No common man may eat of the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 22:10). |
| Leviticus 22:10 | and a hired servant | Yevamot 70a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an uncircumcised</b> priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i>? It is stated: “A sojourner and a hired servant</b> shall not eat thereof” (Exodus 12:45) <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb, and it is stated: “A sojourner</b> of a priest <b>and a hired servant</b> shall not eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10) <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>. Just as “a sojourner and a hired servant” stated with regard to the Paschal lamb</b> indicates that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited</b> from eating <b>it, so too, “a sojourner and a hired servant” stated with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> teaches that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited</b> from eating <b>it.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:10 | Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: The verse states: “No foreigner | Yevamot 70b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: The verse states: “No foreigner</b> may eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10), which indicates: A disqualification stemming from <b>foreignness I told you</b> prevents one from eating <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not</b> a disqualification based on <b>acute mourning.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Say</b> that the verse comes to teach that a disqualification stemming from foreignness prevents one from eating <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not</b> a disqualification based on a priest’s <b>lack of circumcision,</b> and so it should be permitted for an uncircumcised priest to partake of <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written</b> with regard to both <i>teruma</i> and the Paschal lamb: <b>“A sojourner and a hired servant”?</b> From this it is derived by way of a verbal analogy that it is prohibited for an uncircumcised priest to eat <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:10 | Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The verse states: “No foreigner | Yevamot 71a:5 | <b>The Master said</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it <b>is not necessary</b> to derive by way of a verbal analogy the <i>halakha</i> that an uncircumcised priest may not eat <i>teruma</i>, <b>as</b> the verse <b>says: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> from the seed of Aaron who is a leper or a <i>zav</i> shall not eat of the holy things” (Leviticus 22:4). The repetition of the word <i>ish</i> comes <b>to include an uncircumcised</b> man and indicate that he too may not partake of consecrated food. The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that the verse comes <b>to include an acute mourner</b> in the prohibition against eating <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The verse states: “No foreigner</b> may eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10), which indicates: A disqualification stemming from <b>foreignness I told you</b> prevents one from eating <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not</b> a disqualification based on <b>acute mourning.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:10 | As it is taught | Zevachim 82b:11 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>teruma</i>: The verse states: “A tenant of a priest or a hired worker shall not eat of the consecrated” (Leviticus 22:10). <b>“A tenant”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired</b> as <b>a permanent acquisition,</b> i.e., one who said he wishes to stay with his master. This slave has his ear pierced and he remains with his master until the Jubilee Year. <b>“A hired worker”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired</b> for <b>an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> the standard period of servitude for a Hebrew slave. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | the purchase of his money, | Gittin 42b:14 | § <b>A</b> similar <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a priest’s slave was <b>detained</b> in his master’s possession only due to not having received <b>a bill of manumission,</b> may he <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the slave of a priest may, <b>or</b> may <b>he not partake</b> of it? The Gemara presents the sides of this dilemma: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “But if a priest buy any person, <b>the purchase of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), <b>and this</b> slave <b>is not the purchase of his money,</b> as the master cannot enslave him. <b>Or perhaps since</b> the slave <b>is</b> still <b>lacking a bill of manumission,</b> the words <b>“the purchase of his money” are said about him.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:11 | hear | Gittin 43a:3 | <b>Rabbi Abba said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on a halakhic exposition of the verse that details those who may partake of <i>teruma</i>. The verse states: “But if a priest buys any person, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it; and those who are born in his house, they may eat of his bread” (Leviticus 22:11), and the Sages expound as follows: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And those who are born in his house”? If</b> a slave, who is <b>the purchase of</b> his <b>money,</b> may <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, then in the case of <b>those</b> slaves <b>who are born</b> to the priest <b>in his house,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that they should be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>? |
| Leviticus 22:11 | not partake. The verse states: “The purchase of his money…and those who are born in his house, | Gittin 43a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I still say</b> that perhaps <b>one born in</b> the priest’s <b>house</b> may <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>whether he has monetary value</b> or <b>whether he does not have monetary value.</b> But with regard to a slave <b>purchased of</b> the priest’s <b>money,</b> when <b>he has monetary value, he</b> may <b>partake;</b> when <b>he does not have monetary value, he</b> may <b>not partake. The verse states: “The purchase of his money…and those who are born in his house,</b> they may eat of his bread” (Leviticus 22:11). The verse compares the two, indicating: <b>Just as one born in</b> the priest’s <b>house may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>although he is not worth anything, so too, the purchase of his money</b> may <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>although he is not worth anything.</b> In any event, it is clear from this <i>baraita</i> that it is possible for a slave to have no monetary value. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | is written: “The purchase of his money, | Gittin 85a:23 | The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., if she marries a priest she will not be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from that which <b>is written: “The purchase of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), indicating that a priest’s wife partakes of <i>teruma</i> because she is his acquisition, and that if she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, then his acquisition of her is not complete? |
| Leviticus 22:11 | as it is stated: “If a priest buy any soul, the acquisition of his money, | Ketubot 57b:11 | § The mishna states: <b>If the</b> appointed <b>time</b> for the wedding <b>arrived and they did not get married,</b> she may partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Ulla said: By Torah law, the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> immediately, even before the wedding date arrives, <b>as it is stated: “If a priest buy any soul, the acquisition of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), <b>and this</b> woman <b>is also an acquisition of his money</b> through the betrothal. Therefore, she is entitled to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>she may not partake?</b> It is <b>lest someone pour her a cup</b> of <i>teruma</i> wine while she is <b>in her father’s house.</b> Although she may drink it as the betrothed of a priest, since she is still living in her father’s house there is a concern that <b>she will give her brother or sister to drink</b> from the wine, which is prohibited, as they are non-priests. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | “The acquisition of his money” | Ketubot 58a:8 | § The mishna states that <b>a <i>yavam</i> does not enable</b> the <i>yevama</i> <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“The acquisition of his money”</b> (Leviticus 22:11) may partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>but this</b> woman <b>is his brother’s acquisition</b> and not his, since a <i>yavam</i> does not complete his marriage to the <i>yevama</i> until he consummates the marriage. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | as it is stated: “But if a priest buy any soul, the acquisition of his money, | Kiddushin 5a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> betrothal <b>money not enable</b> a woman <b>to partake of</b> <i>teruma</i>? <b>But didn’t Ulla say: By Torah law the daughter of a non-priest</b> who is <b>betrothed</b> to a priest may <b>partake of <i>teruma</i></b> immediately upon her betrothal, <b>as it is stated: “But if a priest buy any soul, the acquisition of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), <b>and this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>the acquisition of his money.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:11 | “And those who are born in his house, they may eat [ yokhelu ] of his bread” | Niddah 44a:10 | The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>enables</b> his mother, an Israelite woman who is no longer married to his father, a priest, to continue <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written,</b> with regard to those who are entitled to partake of <i>teruma</i> on account of a priest: <b>“And those who are born in his house, they may eat [<i>yokhelu</i>] of his bread”</b> (Leviticus 22:11). <b>Read into</b> the verse: Those who are born in his house <b>enable others to eat [<i>ya’akhilu</i>] of his bread,</b> i.e., on account of her son the priest, the Israelite mother may continue to partake of <i>teruma</i> even after the death of his father. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | may eat of it” | Yevamot 57a:13 | The Gemara suggests an answer to this dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: When Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥinnana came from the south, he came and brought</b> this <b><i>baraita</i> in hand: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a priest with crushed testicles</b> or with other wounds to his genitals <b>who married the daughter of converts entitles her to partake of <i>teruma</i>? As it is stated: “But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money,</b> he <b>may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 22:11). In this context, a wife is also considered his monetary acquisition, and therefore she may partake of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | to a priest who married a woman and acquired slaves that they partake of teruma ? As it is stated: “But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it” | Yevamot 66a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if a priest married a woman forbidden to him, his wife’s <b>slaves of usufruct</b> property <b>do not partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is this so? <b>Let</b> this case <b>be like</b> that of <b>his acquisition who acquired an acquisition, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a priest who married a woman and acquired slaves that they partake of <i>teruma</i>? As it is stated: “But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 22:11). |
| Leviticus 22:11 | “The purchase of his money, | Yevamot 67b:14 | It is taught in the mishna that the same principle applies to <b>a <i>yavam</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If she is the daughter of a priest</b> who has a levirate bond <b>to an Israelite, he disqualifies her,</b> as it is stated in the verse cited above: <b>“And is returned to her father’s house,”</b> which <b>excludes a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i>,</b> who has not returned to her father’s house, as a levirate bond was created with her <i>yavam</i>. <b>If she is an Israelite woman</b> with a levirate bond <b>to a priest, he does not enable her to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“The purchase of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), <b>and this</b> woman <b>is his brother’s acquisition.</b> The bond with her <i>yavam</i> ensued from his late brother’s marriage to her, not through any action of his own. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | “The purchase of his money, | Yevamot 68a:2 | It is <b>also</b> taught in the mishna that <b>a deaf-mute</b> disqualifies a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i> and does not enable her to do so. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If she is the daughter of a priest</b> married to a deaf-mute <b>Israelite, he disqualifies her, as he acquired her through</b> marriage sanctioned by <b>an ordinance of the Sages.</b> Although the marriage of a deaf-mute is invalid by Torah law, the Sages instituted an ordinance validating this type of marriage. <b>And if she is an Israelite woman</b> married <b>to</b> a deaf-mute <b>priest, he does not enable</b> her <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“The purchase of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), <b>and this</b> deaf-mute <b>is not capable of acquisition</b> by Torah law, as he is not legally competent. |
| Leviticus 22:11 | lest you say | Yevamot 81a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the mishna’s teaching concerning a priest who was sexually impotent from birth: This <b>is obvious;</b> why should such a priest not enable his wife to partake of <i>teruma</i>? The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that since the verse states: “And such as are born in his house, they eat of his bread” (Leviticus 22:11), the allowance to eat <i>teruma</i> depends on the priest’s capacity to father children, i.e., that only <b>one who can father</b> children <b>enables</b> his wife <b>to eat</b> <i>teruma</i>, but <b>one who cannot father</b> children <b>does not enable</b> his wife <b>to eat</b> <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the priest’s capacity to have children is irrelevant. |
| Leviticus 22:12 | of items called kodashim , as it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man, she shall not eat of terumat hakodashim ” | Ketubot 25a:4 | The Gemara answers that <b>this is</b> what the verse <b>is saying: Neither</b> did they partake <b>of items called <i>kodesh</i>, as it is written: “And no common man may eat of <i>kodesh</i>”</b> (Leviticus 22:10), referring to <i>teruma</i>, <b>nor</b> did they partake <b>of items called <i>kodashim</i>, as it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man, she shall not eat of <i>terumat hakodashim</i>”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). <b>The Master said</b> that this means: <b>Of</b> that which is <b>set aside from the offerings [<i>kodashim</i>]</b> to the priests, i.e., the loaves of the thanks-offering and the breast and the shoulder, <b>they may not partake.</b> According to neither explanation can any proof be cited from the <i>baraita</i> as to whether or not one elevates from <i>teruma</i> or from the Priestly Benediction to lineage. |
| Leviticus 22:12 | as the verse states: “And a daughter of a priest, if she is married to a non-priest, she may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things” | Kiddushin 69b:16 | The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the Tirshatha <b>is saying:</b> They may <b>not</b> partake of <b>anything that is called sacred [<i>kodesh</i>], nor anything that is called most sacred [<i>kodashim</i>].</b> The Gemara clarifies. The words <b>not anything that is called sacred</b> are referring to <i>teruma</i>, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“No non-priest may eat of the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 22:10). And the words <b>nor anything that is called most sacred</b> are referring to offerings, <b>as the verse states: “And a daughter of a priest, if she is married to a non-priest, she may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). <b>And the Master says:</b> What is the meaning of “that which is set apart from the sacred things”? It means <b>from</b> the portions <b>separated from the offerings,</b> i.e., the breast and thigh of a peace-offering, |
| Leviticus 22:12 | “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a non-priest, | Sanhedrin 51a:17 | The Gemara clarifies: If she is married to a man of flawed lineage, she is already profaned. <b>As the Master said,</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“And if a priest’s daughter be married to a non-priest,</b> she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred” (Leviticus 22:12), that <b>once she engaged in intercourse with one who is unfit for her, he has disqualified her</b> from ever partaking of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:12 | “And if a priest’s daughter should be unto a strange man, | Sotah 26b:7 | The Gemara asks with regard to Rav Hamnuna’s statement that a gentile who engages in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a priest <b>disqualifies</b> her <b>from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>: Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that he does not disqualify her, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And if a priest’s daughter should be unto a strange man,</b> she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things” (Leviticus 22:12), indicating that if a woman engages in sexual intercourse with one who is unfit for her, he disqualifies her from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. Since the term “should be unto” denotes marriage, one might say <b>that one who is eligible for betrothal, yes,</b> he disqualifies the woman; but a gentile, <b>who is not eligible for betrothal, does not</b> disqualify her. Rav Hamnuna therefore <b>teaches us that</b> a gentile <b>disqualifies</b> the woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, as one can learn <b>from</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:12 | Rav said: The verse states: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man [ ish zar ], | Yevamot 68a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that intercourse with an unfit man renders a woman unfit to partake of <i>teruma</i> and marry a priest? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The verse states: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man [<i>ish zar</i>],</b> she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred” (Leviticus 22:12). It may be derived that <b>since she engaged in intercourse with one who is unfit for her, he disqualified her</b> from marrying into the priesthood, as the literal meaning of the expression <i>ish zar</i> is a man who is excluded. |
| Leviticus 22:12 | be married” | Yevamot 68b:12 | Now that the source has been established, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps you should <b>say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> pertaining to a woman who <b>engaged in intercourse with</b> a man <b>unfit for her</b> applies only to <b>those liable to receive <i>karet</i></b> for their act of intercourse, but not to intercourse with a man who is unfit to marry into the assembly of Israel. The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“If</b> a priest’s daughter <b>be married”</b> (Leviticus 22:12), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> is referring to <b>those who</b> can <b>have</b> a valid <b>marriage,</b> while <b>those liable to receive <i>karet</i></b> for their act of intercourse <b>are not fit for marriage.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:12 | As it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man, she may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred” | Yevamot 68b:3 | The Gemara asks: The verse “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man” (Leviticus 22:12), from which Rav derived the <i>halakha</i> being discussed, that intercourse with an unfit man renders a woman unfit to partake of <i>teruma</i> and marry a priest, <b>is still necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> a priest’s daughter <b>returns</b> to her father’s house after the death of her Israelite husband, <b>she resumes</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>, but she does not resume</b> partaking of the <b>breast and</b> the right <b>hind leg</b> of sacrificial offerings. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina, son of Rav Sheila, said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a common man, she may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). This implies that even after her husband’s death, <b>she may not partake of the</b> portion <b>separated from consecrated</b> offerings. Therefore, the verse cannot be the source for the above <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:12 | be [ tihye ] to a common man” | Yevamot 69a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>betrothal of those</b> who may not engage in intercourse, as they are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition, does not take effect, and</b> therefore the meaning of the phrase <b>“And if</b> a priest’s daughter <b>be [<i>tihye</i>] to a common man”</b> (Leviticus 22:12) is not: If she marries him, but rather: <b>If she engages in intercourse</b> with him, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to mention the phrase <b>“a widow, or divorced”</b> in the verse: “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced…she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13)? It is not necessary for this phrase to teach that a gentile and a slave disqualify a woman from marrying into the priesthood through sexual intercourse, as suggested by Rabbi Yishmael, as they are included in the prohibition proscribing a woman who engaged in intercourse with a man who is unfit for her. |
| Leviticus 22:12 | “She may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things” | Yevamot 87a:5 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to the daughter of a priest, <b>when she returns</b> to her father’s house after having been married to a non-priest and then separated from her husband, <b>she returns to</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i> but she does not return to</b> partake of <b>the breast and</b> right <b>hind leg</b> of peace-offerings. <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina bar Sheila said: What is the verse</b> that teaches us this <i>halakha</i>? <b>“She may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). This verse indicates: <b>From that which is separated from the sacred things,</b> i.e., offerings, and given to a priest, <b>she may not eat. Rav Naḥman</b> said that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> comes from a different source: We infer from the words “she may eat <b>of</b> her father’s <b>bread”</b> (Leviticus 22:13), that she may <b>not</b> eat <b>all bread;</b> this comes to <b>exclude the breast and</b> right <b>hind leg.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:13 | “And she has no child, | Kiddushin 4a:5 | The Gemara explains: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>one interprets</b> the verse <b>homiletically</b> in <b>this</b> manner? How is it known that the full form of the word <i>ein</i> teaches a <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the daughter of a priest who married a non-priest and was subsequently widowed or divorced: <b>“And she has no child,</b> and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). This verse indicates that if she has no children from her non-priest husband she may once again partake of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | as it is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, | Kiddushin 75b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yishmael hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> in this matter? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a priest, or</b> with <b>the daughter of a Levite, or</b> with <b>the daughter of an Israelite, that they have disqualified her</b> from marrying a priest? It is <b>as it is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child,</b> and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). |
| Leviticus 22:13 | and has no child, | Niddah 44a:11 | § The mishna also teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>disqualifies</b> his mother, the daughter of a priest who is no longer married to his father, an Israelite man, <b>from</b> continuing to partake of <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason is that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow, or divorced, <b>and has no child,</b> and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13), <b>and this</b> daughter of a priest <b>has</b> a child. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | and returns to her father’s house, as in her youth, | Sanhedrin 51a:18 | And if she is married <b>to a Levite or an Israelite,</b> she is <b>also</b> disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i> for as long as they are married; as the verse states: “But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, <b>and returns to her father’s house, as in her youth,</b> she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). <b>By inference, while she is with</b> her non-priest husband, <b>she does not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter should be a widow or a divorcée… | Sotah 26b:8 | This is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a gentile or a slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a priest or with the daughter of a Levite or with</b> the <b>daughter of an Israelite, disqualified her</b> from marrying a priest and from partaking of <i>teruma</i>? This is derived <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter should be a widow or a divorcée…</b>she returns to her father’s house…she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). This indicates that the daughter of a priest returns to eat of her father’s bread, i.e., <i>teruma</i>, if she engaged in sexual intercourse with <b>one whose</b> marriage <b>to her has</b> the potential to end in <b>widowhood or divorce,</b> i.e., a Jew whom she is permitted to marry. This <b>excludes a gentile and a slave, whose</b> marriage <b>to her does not have</b> the potential to end in <b>widowhood or divorce,</b> as their betrothal is invalid. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | As it is stated: “But a priest’s daughter when she will become a widow, or a divorcée, | Yevamot 45a:10 | <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a daughter of a priest or with a female Levite or with a female Israelite that they</b> thereby <b>render her unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood? <b>As it is stated: “But a priest’s daughter when she will become a widow, or a divorcée,</b> and have no child, she returns to her father’s house as in her youth” (Leviticus 22:13). The verse indicates that she returns to her father’s house and enjoys the rights of the priesthood only in a case where she engaged in intercourse with <b>one to whom widowhood and divorce can apply,</b> i.e., one with whom her marriage would be valid and would be broken only through death or divorce. <b>Excluded</b> from this is a union with <b>a gentile or a slave, to whom neither widowhood nor divorce can apply,</b> as no marriage bond can be formed with them. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | disqualifies her | Yevamot 67b:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna that <b>the fetus</b> disqualifies its mother from partaking of <i>teruma</i> and does not enable her to do so. The Gemara explains: <b>If she is the daughter of a priest</b> married <b>to an Israelite,</b> and her husband died and left her pregnant, the fetus <b>disqualifies her</b> from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, as it is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). The phrase <b>“as in her youth” excludes a pregnant woman,</b> whose body has changed from her youth. <b>If</b> she <b>is an Israelite woman</b> married <b>to a priest,</b> the fetus <b>does not enable her to partake,</b> as <b>one who was born enables</b> others <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, whereas <b>one who is not</b> yet <b>born does not enable</b> others <b>to partake.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:13 | to a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with an Israelite woman, or with a priestess, or a Levite woman, that they have disqualified her? As it is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, | Yevamot 68b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, a gentile or a slave</b> who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman <b>should not have disqualified</b> her from marrying into the priesthood, as they cannot marry her. The Gemara answers: <b>These disqualify</b> her, <b>as</b> derived <b>by Rabbi Yishmael, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with an Israelite woman, or with a priestess, or a Levite woman, that they have disqualified her? As it is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced,</b> and have no child, and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). |
| Leviticus 22:13 | daughter | Yevamot 68b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for <b>a priestess; from where do we</b> derive the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a Levite or an Israelite</b> woman who engaged in intercourse with an unfit man, i.e., that they do not partake of <i>teruma</i> even if they marry a priest? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as Rabbi Abba</b> said that <b>Rav said:</b> The verse states: <b>“But</b> if a priest’s <b>daughter</b> be a widow, or divorced” (Leviticus 22:13). It could have begun: If a priest’s <b>daughter.</b> The word “but,” the prefix <i>vav</i>, is seemingly superfluous, and therefore it may indicate the expansion of the prohibition to include additional women. <b>Here too,</b> it may be derived from the distinction between the phrase: If a priest’s <b>daughter,</b> and the phrase: <b>“And</b> if a priest’s <b>daughter,”</b> which utilizes the prefix <i>vav</i>, that Levite and Israelite women are subject to the prohibition as well. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | we did not include a Levite and an Israelite woman | Yevamot 68b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the woman’s disqualification from partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>; from where do we</b> derive that she is disqualified <b>from</b> marrying into the <b>priesthood?</b> The Gemara counters: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we did not include a Levite and an Israelite woman</b> in the verse “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, etc.” (Leviticus 22:13), with regard to their marriage <b>to</b> a member of <b>the priesthood?</b> The derivation that a Levite and an Israelite woman are included in this verse was clearly with regard to their marriage to a priest; <b>as if</b> the inclusion was with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i>, are</b> these women <b>fit to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> at all, regardless of their having engaged in intercourse with an unfit man? Clearly, their inclusion pertains to their marriage to a priest and their partaking of <i>teruma</i> as his wife. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | daughter | Yevamot 69a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a gentile and a slave disqualify <b>a priestess. From where do we</b> derive this with regard to <b>a Levite and an Israelite woman?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rabbi Abba</b> said that <b>Rav said:</b> The verse <b>“But</b> if a priest’s <b>daughter</b> be a widow, or divorced” (Leviticus 22:13) could have begun with the words: If a priest’s <b>daughter.</b> The word “but,” the prefix <i>vav</i>, expands the prohibition to include additional women. <b>Here too,</b> it may be derived from the distinction between the phrase: If a priest’s <b>daughter,</b> and the phrase as it actually appears in the verse: <b>“But</b> if a priest’s <b>daughter,”</b> that Levite and Israelite women are subject to the prohibition as well. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | “a widow, or divorced” | Yevamot 69a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>betrothal of those</b> who may not engage in intercourse, as they are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition, does not take effect, and</b> therefore the meaning of the phrase <b>“And if</b> a priest’s daughter <b>be [<i>tihye</i>] to a common man”</b> (Leviticus 22:12) is not: If she marries him, but rather: <b>If she engages in intercourse</b> with him, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to mention the phrase <b>“a widow, or divorced”</b> in the verse: “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced…she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13)? It is not necessary for this phrase to teach that a gentile and a slave disqualify a woman from marrying into the priesthood through sexual intercourse, as suggested by Rabbi Yishmael, as they are included in the prohibition proscribing a woman who engaged in intercourse with a man who is unfit for her. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | and have no child | Yevamot 70a:6 | § It is stated in the mishna that <b>a <i>mamzer</i> disqualifies</b> a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and he</b> also <b>enables</b> a woman <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The Torah states, “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, <b>and have no child</b>…she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>her</b> own <b>child</b> disqualifies her from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>her child’s child</b> disqualifies her as well? <b>The verse states: “And she has no child [<i>zera</i>]” at all,</b> indicating that even her grandchild disqualifies her, as <i>zera</i> means offspring. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | daughter” | Yevamot 87a:11 | <b>Rav Mordekhai went</b> and <b>stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Ashi,</b> who <b>said</b> to him: <b>From where does</b> he <b>include</b> the case of a woman who partakes of <i>teruma</i> on account of her son? <b>From</b> the verse <b>“but</b> if a priest’s <b>daughter”</b> (Leviticus 22:13). <b>Is</b> the Israelite woman <b>preferable to her,</b> the daughter of a priest herself, who does not return to eating the breast and hind leg? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the Torah <b>writes exclusions,</b> as we learned above, which teach us that she does not return in all regards, whereas <b>here it does not write exclusions.</b> Consequently, although the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who has a son from a priest is itself derived from the case of the daughter of a priest returning to her father’s house, she has more abilities than the latter. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | The Sages taught: “And she is returned unto her father’s house” | Yevamot 87a:12 | § The Gemara returns to the mishna. The mishna taught: The <b>daughter of a priest married to an Israelite</b> may not partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>The Sages taught: “And she is returned unto her father’s house”</b> (Leviticus 22:13); this <b>excludes a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>,</b> for she cannot go back to her father’s house as long as she is still waiting for the <i>yavam</i> to perform levirate marriage. <b>“As in her youth”;</b> this <b>excludes a pregnant woman,</b> as her pregnancy has changed her, and she is no longer as she was in her youth. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | to write “and she have no child” | Yevamot 87a:16 | The Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary to write</b> this verse that teaches the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a pregnant woman, and it was necessary</b> also <b>to write “and she have no child”</b> (Leviticus 22:13) <b>because had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“And she have no child,”</b> I would have said that <b>at the outset</b> she was only <b>one body</b> when she ate <i>teruma</i>, <b>and now,</b> upon her return, there are <b>two bodies,</b> and that is why she is no longer “as in her youth.” <b>But a pregnant woman, who at the outset</b> was <b>one body and now</b> is still <b>one body,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she may partake of</b> <i>teruma</i> until the birth of her son. Consequently, it is <b>necessary</b> for a verse to teach the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And</b> vice-versa, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a pregnant woman,</b> I might have said that this is true only of a pregnant woman <b>because at the outset</b> her <b>body</b> |
| Leviticus 22:13 | is stated: “And she is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth; she may eat of her father’s bread” | Yevamot 87a:2 | If <b>her son from the priest</b> also <b>died, she may not partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> but she may partake of tithe, as she has a son from a Levite. If <b>her son from the Levite died, she may no</b> longer <b>partake of tithe.</b> If <b>her son from the Israelite died, she returns to her father’s house</b> and may once again partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And with regard to this</b> woman, it <b>is stated: “And she is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth; she may eat of her father’s bread”</b> (Leviticus 22:13). |
| Leviticus 22:13 | Rav said: | Yevamot 87a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: If <b>her son from the Levite died she may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> with regard to a woman previously married to a priest, who had a child from the priest and was then married to a Levite and separated from him, <b>that she once again may partake due to her son</b> from the priest, <b>from where do we</b> derive it? <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It states: “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth” (Leviticus 22:13). The verse could have stated: If a priest’s <b>daughter.</b> Instead, it states: <b>“But</b> if a priest’s <b>daughter,”</b> with an extra word, represented by the single Hebrew letter <i>vav</i>, to include this case. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | bread” | Yevamot 87a:5 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to the daughter of a priest, <b>when she returns</b> to her father’s house after having been married to a non-priest and then separated from her husband, <b>she returns to</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i> but she does not return to</b> partake of <b>the breast and</b> right <b>hind leg</b> of peace-offerings. <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina bar Sheila said: What is the verse</b> that teaches us this <i>halakha</i>? <b>“She may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). This verse indicates: <b>From that which is separated from the sacred things,</b> i.e., offerings, and given to a priest, <b>she may not eat. Rav Naḥman</b> said that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> comes from a different source: We infer from the words “she may eat <b>of</b> her father’s <b>bread”</b> (Leviticus 22:13), that she may <b>not</b> eat <b>all bread;</b> this comes to <b>exclude the breast and</b> right <b>hind leg.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:13 | exclude nullification of vows. | Yevamot 87a:6 | <b>Rami bar Ḥama objects to this:</b> But we can <b>say</b> that the verse comes to <b>exclude nullification of vows.</b> The Torah would consequently be teaching us that even after she “is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth” (Leviticus 22:13), she does not return to her youth in all ways, as her father may not nullify her vows. <b>Rava said:</b> The connection between her and her father’s house with regard to vows has <b>already been severed,</b> as taught by <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: “But the vow of a widow, or of a divorcée…shall stand against her”</b> (Numbers 30:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>She was removed from the category</b> of one who is under the authority of her <b>father</b> when she married, <b>and she has</b> likewise <b>been removed from the category</b> of one who is under the authority of her <b>husband,</b> as she is no longer married to him. |
| Leviticus 22:13 | the verse states “and she have no child, | Yevamot 87b:5 | The Gemara inquires: <b>And let us make</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>dead</b> children <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>living</b> ones <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>did not make a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second to exempt her from levirate marriage,</b> it nevertheless <b>made the living like the dead,</b> as a woman whose husband died and left a child is exempt from levirate marriage even if that child subsequently dies; then, in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>made a child from the first like a child from the second to disqualify her from <i>teruma</i>, is it not right that we should make the living like the dead?</b> The Gemara responds: Therefore, <b>the verse states “and she have no child,</b> she is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth” (Leviticus 22:13), <b>and</b> here <b>she does not</b> currently <b>have</b> children. |
| Leviticus 22:14 | and he shall give that which is sacred to a priest” | Bava Metzia54a:16 | If a non-priest unwittingly ate <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> his debt <b>can be repaid</b> to the priest <b>only with non-sacred</b> property, not with <i>teruma</i>, <b>as the Merciful One states:</b> “And if a man eats that which is sacred unwittingly…<b>and he shall give that which is sacred to a priest”</b> (Leviticus 22:14), from which it is derived that repayment must be with <b>an item fit to become sacred,</b> i.e., a non-sacred item, not <i>teruma</i>, which cannot be consecrated again. The question is with regard to payment of <b>its</b> additional <b>one-fifth: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in terms of the possibility <b>that it will be repaid not from non-sacred</b> items, but from <i>teruma</i>? |
| Leviticus 22:14 | it is written: “If a man eats that which is sacred unwittingly, then he shall add its one-fifth payment to it” | Bava Metzia54b:3 | Rava continues: <b>With regard to <i>teruma</i></b> too, <b>it is written: “If a man eats that which is sacred unwittingly, then he shall add its one-fifth payment to it”</b> (Leviticus 22:14), <b>and as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 6:1): <b>One who partakes of <i>teruma</i> unwittingly pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> it concerns <b>one who partakes of</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>or one who drinks</b> it, <b>or one who applies</b> oil to himself; or <b>whether</b> it is <b>ritually pure <i>teruma</i> or ritually impure <i>teruma</i>. He pays its one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> if he partook of that one-fifth, he pays <b>one-fifth of its one-fifth.</b> Rava concludes: <b>While with regard to</b> second <b>tithe,</b> it <b>is neither written</b> in the Torah, <b>nor taught</b> in <b>a mishna, nor raised as a dilemma before us</b> by the <i>amora’im</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:14 | “And a man, if he eats sacrificial | Bava Metzia99b:3 | If one robbed, and is paying compensation <b>to, a common person [<i>hedyot</i>], he pays fifty-less-one</b> <i>perutot</i>. If one robbed another of a cake that was consecrated to the Temple treasury and he is paying compensation <b>to</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>he pays fifty</b> <i>perutot</i> <b>and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of the value as a fine for having misused consecrated property <b>for each</b> one of the cakes. <b>This is not so with regard to one liable for</b> causing <b>damage</b> to consecrated property, <b>who does not pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>as the Master says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And a man, if he eats sacrificial</b> food in error, he should add its fifth on it” (Leviticus 22:14). By specifying that one who eats consecrated property is liable to pay the one-fifth payment, the verse <b>excludes one who is liable for</b> causing <b>damage</b> from that requirement. |
| Leviticus 22:14 | an olive-bulk. | Keritot 6b:26 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>placing [<i>netina</i>] that</b> is stated here, which is <b>upon a stranger,</b> i.e., one upon whom there is no mitzva to place the anointing oil, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>giving [<i>netina</i>] in general. Just as giving in general</b> is with the amount of <b>an olive-bulk, so too, placing</b> anointing oil <b>upon a stranger</b> is with the amount of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> The principle that giving [<i>netina</i>] in general is with the amount of an olive-bulk is derived from the verse: “And if a man eats a sacred thing in error then he shall add a fifth part in addition to it, and shall give [<i>venatan</i>] to the priest the sacred item” (Leviticus 22:14). This verse is referring to an item given for eating, and the minimum amount that must be consumed for an act to be considered eating is an olive-bulk. Rav Yosef adds: <b>But</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>applying</b> the oil in order <b>to anoint kings and priests, everyone agrees</b> it is accomplished with <b>any amount.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:14 | altar | Meilah 15a:13 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous version of Rabbi Yannai’s opinion, and states that in fact he maintains that animals consecrated for sacrifice on the altar are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse by Torah law. As <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai says as follows: From this verse:</b> “If anyone commit a misuse, and sin through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15), <b>we learn</b> that items <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance</b> are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. But <b>we do not learn</b> from this verse that animals consecrated for the <b>altar</b> are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. Instead, that <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: “And if a man eat of the sacred items through error” (Leviticus 22:14), which is referring to all sacred items, or from the verse (Leviticus 3:16): “All the fat is the Lord’s.” |
| Leviticus 22:14 | eats | Meilah 19a:8 | Finally, <b>the Merciful One compared</b> misuse <b>to</b> the partaking of <b><i>teruma</i></b> by a non-priest, through the verbal analogy of the words “sin” and “sin” (see 18b). <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>?</b> The verse states: “And <b>if</b> a man <b>eats</b> of the sacred item through error, then he shall add its fifth part upon it” (Leviticus 22:14). This <b>excludes one who causes damage</b> to the <i>teruma</i> without partaking of it, e.g., by spilling it on the ground. Such a person is exempt from the payment of the additional one-fifth. <b>With regard to consecrated</b> property <b>as well,</b> in the case of <b>any</b> consecrated <b>edible item,</b> or some other item, <b>when</b> one <b>damages it</b> without deriving benefit from the damaging act, he is <b>exempt</b> with regard to misuse. |
| Leviticus 22:14 | its fifth-part | Menachot 77b:23 | Rava elaborates: <b>Since</b> <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>is compared to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> perhaps <b>it is considered like <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> and the same penalties are incurred. <b>Or perhaps,</b> since the verse uses restrictive terms with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, as the verse states of one who intentionally partakes of it: “They shall die <b>due to it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and the verse states with regard to one who unwittingly partakes of it: “Then he shall put <b>its fifth-part</b> unto it” (Leviticus 22:14), <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> this <i>halakha</i> specifically to the case of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe. |
| Leviticus 22:14 | and shall give to the priest the sacred item” | Pesachim 32a:12 | <b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse “And if a man eats a sacred thing in error, then he shall add a fifth part in addition to it, <b>and shall give to the priest the sacred item”</b> (Leviticus 22:14), the Sages expound as follows: He must give the priest <b>an item that is fit to be consecrated, to the exclusion of one who eats <i>teruma</i> of leavened bread on Passover, who is exempt from payment</b> of the <i>teruma</i> and even from paying <b>its monetary</b> value <b>as wood;</b> this is the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to reimburse the priest for these items. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said to Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma: What benefit can</b> the priest <b>derive from this</b> <i>teruma</i> of leavened bread, as it is prohibited to benefit from it? <b>Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma said to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: What benefit can one derive from eating ritually impure <i>teruma</i> on the rest of the days of the year,</b> and yet a non-priest who eats it must <b>pay</b> the priest. |
| Leviticus 22:14 | the verse states: “And if a man eats a sacred item in error, | Pesachim 32b:4 | After mentioning cases where a person damages <i>teruma</i>, the Gemara continues with a discussion of this topic. <b>The Rabbis taught:</b> A non-priest <b>who eats an olive-bulk of <i>teruma</i></b> must <b>pay the principal</b> value of the <i>teruma</i> itself <b>and an</b> additional <b>fifth. Abba Shaul says:</b> He is not required to pay <b>unless</b> the <i>teruma</i> he ate is <b>worth a <i>peruta</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is because <b>the verse states: “And if a man eats a sacred item in error,</b> then he shall add a fifth part in addition to it, and he shall give to the priest the sacred item” (Leviticus 22:14). The minimal amount that is halakhically considered <b>eating is an olive-bulk.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:14 | “Then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto it” | Yevamot 86a:3 | The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “They will die through it if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and a different verse states: <b>“Then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto it”</b> (Leviticus 22:14). A close reading of these verses shows that the Torah is emphasizing that the death penalty comes <b>through it,</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>and not through tithes,</b> and that a fifth must be added <b>to it, but not to tithes.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir, how do they account for the comparison in the above verse? The Gemara answers: They would say it teaches that <b>just as</b> the requirement to separate <b><i>teruma</i> produces</b> the status of forbidden <b>untithed produce, so too</b> the requirement to separate the <b>first tithe also produces</b> the status of forbidden <b>untithed produce.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:14 | eat | Yoma 80b:10 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: A non-priest who ate <i>teruma</i> in an excessive manner pays the principal,</b> that which he took, <b>and does not pay the</b> additional <b>fifth,</b> which one who illegally eats <i>teruma</i> pays to the priest as a penalty. This is because it states about one who eats <i>teruma</i>: “And <b>if</b> a man <b>eat</b> of the sacred thing in error, then he shall add a fifth to it, and give the priest the sacred thing” (Leviticus 22:14). The word “eat” <b>excludes</b> one who is not eating but <b>harming</b> himself. He does, however, pay the principal, since he caused a loss to the priest. The fifth is only paid by one who eats normally, not excessively. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest</b> |
| Leviticus 22:14 | “eats” | Yoma 81a:1 | <b>who chews on barley of <i>teruma</i></b> that has not been ground or baked <b>pays the principal and not</b> an extra <b>fifth.</b> The reason is that it states <b>“eats”</b> (Leviticus 22:14), <b>which excludes one who harms</b> himself. Consuming raw barley is considered self-harm, not eating. |
| Leviticus 22:15 | exempt from payment? The verse states: “And they shall not profane the sacred things of the children of Israel, which they set apart | Chullin 130b:13 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a homeowner who consumed his produce</b> while it was <b>untithed,</b> i.e., neither <i>teruma</i> nor the first tithe had been separated, <b>and similarly,</b> with regard to <b>a Levite who consumed his tithes</b> while they were <b>untithed,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the tithe had not been separated, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt from payment? The verse states: “And they shall not profane the sacred things of the children of Israel, which they set apart</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:15). This teaches that <b>you,</b> the priest, <b>have</b> rights <b>to them only from the time of separation onward.</b> Since the produce was eaten before <i>teruma</i> was separated from it, the priest cannot claim payment for it in court. |
| Leviticus 22:15 | “And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart for the Lord” | Niddah 32a:8 | <b>Mar Zutra says:</b> That immersion <b>was necessary only for smearing oil of <i>teruma</i></b> of outside of Eretz Yisrael. Since smearing is equivalent to eating, it would have been prohibited to smear such oil on the baby girl, were it not for her immersion in a ritual bath. And from where is it derived that smearing is like eating with regard to <i>teruma</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse discussing the prohibition against consuming <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual impurity states: <b>“And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart for the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). The verse serves <b>to include</b> in this prohibition <b>one who smears and one who drinks.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:15 | as it is written: “They shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they will set apart unto the Lord” | Sanhedrin 83a:9 | The Gemara elaborates: It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who partakes of untithed produce</b> is liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who partakes of untithed produce</b> is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “They shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they will set apart unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). From the fact that it is formulated in the future tense: “Which they will set apart,” it is clear that <b>the verse is speaking</b> about items <b>that are destined to be separated</b> in the future, i.e. untithed produce from which <i>teruma</i> and tithes will be separated. |
| Leviticus 22:15 | which the verse states: “And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they will set apart [ yarimu ] unto the Lord” | Zevachim 11b:5 | <b>Rav Ashi teaches in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> the same statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yannai: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shimon, brother of Azarya?</b> It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they will set apart [<i>yarimu</i>] unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). The verse is interpreted not as a prohibition but as a halakhic axiom, teaching that offerings <b>are not profaned,</b> i.e., disqualified, <b>by</b> sacrifice for the sake of offerings whose sanctity is <b>more elevated [<i>muram</i>] than theirs; they are profaned</b> only <b>by</b> sacrifice for the sake of offerings whose sanctity is <b>less than theirs.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:15 | “And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto the Lord” | Zevachim 3b:5 | The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, the reasoning</b> behind the statement <b>of Rav</b> that a sin offering slaughtered for the consumption of non-sacred meat is fit is not in accordance with this principle at all, but it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. As Rabbi Elazar says: What is the reasoning</b> behind the statement <b>of Rav?</b> The verse: <b>“And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15), teaches that only improper intentions for the sake of <b>sacred items,</b> i.e., offerings, <b>desecrate sacred items, but non-sacred</b> intent <b>does not desecrate sacred items.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:15 | the children of Israel” | Zevachim 45a:7 | The Gemara’s explanation continues: <b>But</b> if one derived benefit from them, he is <b>not</b> liable after the fact for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property through a verbal analogy between <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to misuse of consecrated items and the word <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> With regard to misuse of consecrated property, the verse states: “If any one commits a trespass, and sins through error, in the sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). In the case of <i>teruma</i>, the verse states: “Lest they bear sin for it, and die due to it, if they profane it” (Leviticus 22:9). And <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, it is written:</b> “And they shall not profane the sacred items of <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:15), which indicates: <b>But not</b> the sacred items of <b>gentiles,</b> i.e., one is not liable for partaking of the <i>teruma</i> of gentiles while he is in a state of ritual impurity. |
| Leviticus 22:15 | “And they shall not profane the sacred items of the children of Israel” | Zevachim 45b:17 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>notar</i> is derived <b>from that</b> which <b>Levi taught</b> with regard to the verse: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they consecrate to Me, and that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2), which is referring to the eating of consecrated food in a state of ritual impurity. <b>As Levi taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the verse is speaking even of a disqualification</b> caused by <b>time,</b> and not only ritual impurity? <b>The verse states</b> profanation elsewhere: <b>“And they shall not profane the sacred items of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). |
| Leviticus 22:15 | “And they shall not profane the sacred items of the children of Israel” | Zevachim 46b:15 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered</b> with intent that the slaughter be <b>for the sake of a burnt offering,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> As explained (2a), a sin offering that was slaughtered for the sake of another offering is entirely disqualified. But if he intended the slaughter to be <b>for the sake of a non-sacred</b> animal, it is <b>valid. Rabbi Elazar says: What is the reason of Rav?</b> The verse states: <b>“And they shall not profane the sacred items of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). This teaches that <b>consecrated items,</b> i.e., the intent to slaughter an offering for the sake of another type of offering, <b>profane consecrated items, but</b> the intent to slaughter an offering for the sake of <b>a non-sacred</b> animal <b>does not profane consecrated items.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:16 | as it is stated: “And so bring upon them a sin of guilt when they eat their sacred items” | Sanhedrin 90b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One who gives <i>teruma</i> to a priest who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>even causes</b> the priest’s <b>death, as it is stated</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And die therefore if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9). Priests who partake of <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual impurity profane it and are liable to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven. <b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught:</b> By giving <i>teruma</i> to a priest who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>one also brings upon him a sin of guilt,</b> i.e., a sin that will lead to additional sins, <b>as it is stated: “And so bring upon them a sin of guilt when they eat their sacred items”</b> (Leviticus 22:16). |
| Leviticus 22:17 | “And the Lord spoke to Moses saying” | Pesachim 42a:2 | From here <b>I have only</b> derived that he violates <b>a positive mitzva; from where do I</b> derive that he also transgresses <b>a prohibition? The verse states</b> at the beginning of that passage: <b>“And the Lord spoke to Moses saying”</b> (Leviticus 22:17). This introductory statement <b>teaches with regard to the entire portion that a prohibition applies to it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:18 | should not enter your mind, as it is taught | Chullin 13b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you draw that conclusion? <b>Perhaps this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying:</b> With regard to offerings <b>from Jews, from righteous</b> Jews <b>accept</b> the offering and <b>from wicked</b> Jews <b>do not accept</b> the offering; <b>but with regard to the nations of the world, do not</b> accept their offerings <b>at all.</b> The Gemara rejects that possibility: That <b>should not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] from the house of Israel…who shall sacrifice his offering” (Leviticus 22:18): Since it would have been sufficient to write: <b>A man [<i>ish</i>], what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> It serves <b>to include the gentiles, who</b> may <b>vow</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings like a Jew.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:18 | that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will offerings that they sacrifice to the Lord” | Menachot 104b:9 | <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> an explanation of the following verse: “Anyone <b>that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will offerings that they sacrifice to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). It is evident from the use of the plural in the second part of the verse that <b>any</b> offering can <b>be brought in a partnership, and the verse excludes only a meal offering</b> from this principle, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering.” |
| Leviticus 22:18 | which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering” | Menachot 73b:2 | <b>And if you wish, cite a verse:</b> “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] who is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, <b>which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). The doubled term <i>ish ish</i> teaches that the offerings of a gentile are accepted, and the verse thereby teaches that <b>any</b> offering <b>that</b> gentiles volunteer to be <b>sacrificed should be a burnt offering.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:18 | for any of their vows or for any of their gift offerings, | Nazir 25a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But the money for the sin-offering is mingled with these</b> unallocated funds. How can it all be used for gift burnt-offerings? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is</b> an accepted <b><i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite</b> that his unallocated funds are used for gift offerings, despite the fact that they include the value of a sin-offering. <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The verse states: “Whether <b>for any of their vows or for any of their gift offerings,</b> which are brought to the Lord as a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 22:18). In this verse, <b>the Torah states</b> that <b>the surplus of a vow shall be for a gift offering.</b> Here too, if the vow of naziriteship cannot be fulfilled, due to the death of the one who took the vow, the money is for a gift offering. |
| Leviticus 22:18 | as a burnt-offering” | Nazir 61b:8 | Rava continues his explanation: However, the Sages would <b>say</b> in response to this suggestion: <b>If</b> the phrase “the children of Israel” is written <b>due to</b> the need to exclude a gentile from bringing a nazirite <b>offering, one does not</b> need to <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here, and</b> this is because it is already derived <b>from there,</b> as a <i>baraita</i> teaches that the verse: “Any man from the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who sacrifices his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which are sacrificed to the Lord <b>as a burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 22:18), <b>excludes</b> a gentile from the offering of <b>naziriteship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Therefore, the phrase “the children of Israel” must exclude gentiles from the entire passage of naziriteship, and not just from bringing the offerings. |
| Leviticus 22:18 | man [ ish ] | Nazir 62a:2 | § The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), stated <b>with regard to valuations,</b> from which it is derived that gentiles are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of valuations? <b>After all, aren’t valuations juxtaposed to vows, as the verse states: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation.” And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> a verse dealing with <b>vows:</b> “Any <b>man [<i>ish</i>]</b> from the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who sacrifices his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which are sacrificed to the Lord as a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 22:18), <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the extra emphasis: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: This serves <b>to include the gentiles, that they can take a vow</b> for <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings <b>like a Jew.</b> It can be derived from this juxtaposition that gentiles are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. |
| Leviticus 22:18 | to the Lord | Temurah 3a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I see</b> the logic of the opinion that <b>in all of</b> these cases it is correct <b>to be stringent</b> about the offerings of gentiles. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason? With regard to</b> the offering of a gentile, <b>it is written:</b> “Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which are brought <b>to the Lord</b> for a burnt offering” (Leviticus 22:18). The verse equates the offerings of gentiles, “the strangers in Israel,” with those of Jews, and indicates that the consecrated status of the former is identical to that of the latter. |
| Leviticus 22:18 | to the Lord” | Zevachim 45a:5 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says: I see</b> the logic of the opinion that <b>in all of</b> these cases it is correct <b>to be stringent</b> about the offerings of gentiles, <b>as it is stated with regard to them:</b> “Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel that will sacrifice his offering…<b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). This indicates that all offerings, even those of gentiles, are fully consecrated to God; therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and eating the meat while ritually impure should all apply to the offerings of gentiles. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of items <b>consecrated for the altar. But</b> with regard to items that are <b>consecrated</b> by gentiles <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> one who derives benefit from them is liable for <b>misusing them.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:20 | for it shall not be acceptable for you” | Menachot 25a:10 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> about blemished animals: <b>“It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:23), and: “But whatsoever has a blemish that you shall not bring; <b>for it shall not be acceptable for you”</b> (Leviticus 22:20), teaching that in no case are blemished animals accepted as offerings, even due to the frontplate. |
| Leviticus 22:20 | whatsoever has a blemish, that you shall not bring; | Temurah 5b:22 | The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of one who <b>consecrated blemished</b> animals <b>for</b> sacrifice on <b>the altar,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “But <b>whatsoever has a blemish, that you shall not bring;</b> for it shall not be acceptable for you” (Leviticus 22:20)? <b>And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one consecrates blemished</b> animals <b>for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar, even though he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done,</b> and the consecration takes effect. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:20 | the verse state: “But whatever has a blemish, you shall not offer; | Temurah 6b:10 | § The Gemara returns to the topic of blemished animals. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “But whatever has a blemish, you shall not offer;</b> for it shall not be acceptable for you” (Leviticus 22:20)? <b>If</b> it serves to teach that <b>you may not slaughter</b> a blemished animal as a sacrifice even if it has been consecrated, <b>that is</b> already <b>stated below,</b> later on in the passage, as the Gemara will soon explain. <b>Rather, why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that <b>you may not offer</b> a blemished animal? This serves to teach that <b>you may not consecrate</b> it. <b>From here,</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:10): <b>One who consecrates blemished</b> animals <b>for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar violates five</b> separate <b>categories</b> of prohibition. |
| Leviticus 22:21 | blemish in it” | Beitzah 27b:3 | The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do you say that causing</b> a blemish to an offering <b>is prohibited? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to offerings: <b>“There must not be</b> any <b>blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21). <b>I have only</b> an explicit prohibition <b>that it may not have a blemish; from where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not cause</b> a blemish <b>to it by means of something else,</b> e.g., <b>that he does not bring dough or a dried fig and place it on its ear so that a dog will come and take it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? Therefore <b>the verse states “any blemish.” It says “blemish” and it says “any blemish”;</b> the word “any” comes to teach that one may not cause a blemish. |
| Leviticus 22:21 | there shall be no blemish in it” | Bekhorot 33b:17 | These Sages <b>disagree only with regard to one who causes a blemish in</b> an already <b>blemished</b> animal, such as one whose blood circulation is constricted. <b>As Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that as the verse states: “It shall be perfect to be accepted; <b>there shall be no blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), this categorical statement includes even the causing of a blemish in an offering that is already blemished. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that the phrase <b>“It shall be perfect to be accepted”</b> indicates that the prohibition against causing a blemish applies only to an animal that is currently perfect, i.e., unblemished, and can therefore be accepted, i.e., it is fit to be sacrificed upon the altar. If the animal is already blemished, there is no prohibition against causing an additional blemish in it. |
| Leviticus 22:21 | blemish in it” | Bekhorot 33b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis as well,</b> who derive their opinion from the verse: “It shall be perfect to be accepted,” <b>isn’t it written: “There shall not be any blemish in it,”</b> which indicates an expansion of the prohibition against causing a blemish upon an offering? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that</b> the prohibition against causing a blemish extends also to a blemish caused as the result of <b>an indirect</b> action. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“There shall not be</b> any <b>blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21); from here <b>I have</b> derived |
| Leviticus 22:21 | any blemish | Bekhorot 34a:1 | <b>only</b> the prohibition <b>that one may not</b> directly <b>cause a blemish. From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not bring</b> pressed <b>figs or dough and place it on the</b> animal’s <b>ear so that a dog will come and eat it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? <b>The verse states:</b> “There shall not be <b>any blemish</b> in it” (Leviticus 22:21), indicating that the same prohibition applies <b>both</b> when the <b>blemish</b> is caused directly <b>and</b> when it is <b>any blemish,</b> even one caused indirectly. |
| Leviticus 22:21 | The Merciful One states: “It shall be complete to be accepted” | Bekhorot 39a:17 | The Gemara clarifies the dilemma. <b>The Merciful One states: “It shall be complete to be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), which indicates that <b>a complete</b> animal, <b>yes,</b> is fit as a sacrifice, but if it is <b>lacking</b> in any manner, even on the inside, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>Or perhaps</b> one should interpret this phrase: <b>“It shall be complete to be accepted,”</b> in light of what is stated immediately afterward: <b>“There shall be no blemish therein.” Just as a blemish is on the outside,</b> as taught by the next verse, which says: “Blind or broken,” <b>so too,</b> the status of <b>lacking</b> a limb applies only if it is lacking <b>on the outside.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:21 | there shall be no blemish in it” | Menachot 56b:4 | These Sages <b>disagree only with regard to one who inflicts a blemish on</b> an already <b>blemished</b> animal, such as one whose blood circulation is constricted. <b>Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that as the verse states: “It shall be perfect to be accepted; <b>there shall be no blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), this categorical statement includes even the infliction of a blemish on an offering that is already blemished. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that the phrase <b>“it shall be perfect to be accepted”</b> indicates that the prohibition against inflicting a blemish applies only to an animal that is currently perfect, i.e., unblemished, and can therefore be accepted, meaning that it is suitable to be sacrificed upon the altar. If the animal is already blemished, there is no prohibition against inflicting an additional blemish upon it. |
| Leviticus 22:21 | “There shall not be any blemish in it” | Menachot 56b:8 | The Gemara analyzes the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis as well,</b> who base their opinion on the phrase: “It shall be perfect to be accepted,” <b>isn’t it written: “There shall not be any blemish in it,”</b> which indicates an expansion of the prohibition against inflicting a blemish? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“There shall not be any blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only that it may not have a blemish</b> caused directly by human action. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not cause</b> a blemish to be inflicted <b>upon it</b> indirectly <b>by means of other</b> agents, e.g., <b>that one may not place dough or</b> pressed <b>figs on its ear so that a dog will come and take it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? <b>The verse states: “Any blemish.” It says: “Blemish,” and it says “Any blemish”;</b> the word “no” serves to teach that one may not cause a blemish indirectly. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | as it is written: “Blind or broken | Bekhorot 14b:5 | <b>As Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who slaughters a blemished animal upon</b> a private <b>altar of an individual at a time when</b> private <b>altars are permitted is in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “You shall not sacrifice to the Lord an ox, or a sheep,</b> in which is a blemish” (Deuteronomy 17:1). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>matter of a great</b> public <b>altar,</b> since that <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different verse, <b>as it is written: “Blind or broken</b>…you shall not sacrifice these unto the Lord” (Leviticus 22:22), <b>apply</b> the verse in Deuteronomy to the <b>matter of</b> a private <b>altar of an individual.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:22 | it is written: “Blind or broken” | Bekhorot 39a:16 | <b>If</b> the dilemma was raised <b>with regard to</b> whether other <b>sacrificial</b> animals with such a blemish are thereby disqualified from being sacrificed and may be redeemed, <b>it is written: “Blind or broken”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which are also types of exposed blemishes. The Gemara explains that <b>we do not raise</b> this <b>dilemma with regard to slaughtering</b> the firstborn <b>or redeeming</b> other sacrificial animals, as it is clearly not considered a blemish to that extent. Rather, <b>we raise the dilemma with regard to disqualifying</b> the animal from sacrifice. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? |
| Leviticus 22:22 | a crack [ ḥaritz ], | Bekhorot 41a:18 | <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a hermaphrodite, granted</b> that one does <b>not</b> slaughter it <b>in the Temple,</b> as <b>perhaps it is a female. But with regard to</b> the rest of <b>the country, even let it be</b> considered <b>a male;</b> nevertheless, its <b>female</b> sex organ <b>should be considered</b> as <b>a crack [<i>ḥaritz</i>],</b> which is included in the blemish of “cracked” [<i>ḥarutz</i>] listed in the Torah (Leviticus 22:22), <b>and</b> let <b>one slaughter</b> it <b>due to</b> that blemish. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | The verse states: “Or cracked or broken” | Bekhorot 41a:19 | <b>Abaye said</b> in response: <b>The verse states: “Or cracked or broken”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which teaches that the blemish of being <b>cracked is similar to</b> that of being <b>broken: Just as</b> the blemish of being <b>broken</b> is relevant <b>in the location of a bone,</b> as there is no break where there is only flesh, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>cracked</b> is referring to a blemish found <b>in the location of a bone,</b> not in the location of the sex organs. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | “Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wart, or scabbed, or scurvy, you shall not offer these to the Lord” | Sotah 46a:8 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that sacred</b> offerings <b>are not disqualified by labor derived from this</b> verse? <b>It is derived from elsewhere.</b> The verse states with regard to sacred offerings: <b>“Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wart, or scabbed, or scurvy, you shall not offer these to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:22). This verse serves to create an exclusion, teaching that it is <b>these</b> that <b>you may not sacrifice, but you may sacrifice sacred</b> animals <b>that have been used for labor.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> twice. <b>It might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one may sacrifice animals that have been used for labor, <b>applies only</b> in a case where <b>they were used for permitted labor, but</b> if they were used for <b>prohibited labor,</b> e.g., on Shabbat, you might <b>say that it is prohibited</b> to bring <b>them</b> as offerings. In order to refute this argument, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> again. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | you shall not offer” | Temurah 6b:12 | The Gemara interjects: <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>If</b> one suggests that the prohibition in Leviticus 22:20 teaches that <b>you may not slaughter</b> a blemished animal as an offering, <b>that is</b> already <b>stated below,</b> later on in the passage. The Gemara asks: <b>Where is</b> it <b>stated?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a cyst,</b> or scabbed, or scurvy, <b>you shall not offer”</b> (Leviticus 22:22)? <b>If</b> this serves to teach that <b>you may not consecrate</b> them, <b>that is already stated above,</b> in verse 20. <b>Rather, why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that <b>you may not offer</b> these animals? This serves to teach that <b>you may not slaughter</b> them if they have been consecrated. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | “Nor make an offering by fire of them | Temurah 6b:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states: <b>“Nor make an offering by fire of them</b> upon the altar unto the Lord” (Leviticus 22:22). <b>These</b> words teach that one may not burn a blemished animal in the <b>fires</b> of the altar. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is prohibited to burn <b>all of</b> the animal. <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is prohibited to burn <b>some</b> portions <b>of</b> the animal? <b>The verse states: “Of them,”</b> which prohibits the burning of even part of them. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | “fire” | Temurah 6b:18 | <b>Rava said: There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> discussing offerings slaughtered outside the Temple, the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from the context of the verse.</b> The verse states: <b>“And</b> has not brought it <b>to the entrance</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:4), which serves <b>to include</b> any unblemished animal. Therefore, the following term: <b>“Unto the Lord,”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> certain exceptions to the rule. <b>Here, where</b> the verse states <b>“fire”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which serves <b>to exclude</b> animals not burned on the altar from the prohibition, the term: <b>“Unto the Lord,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> exceptions to that principle. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | “Upon the altar” | Temurah 7a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who holds that one is not liable for collection of the blood per se, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“You shall not offer,”</b> stated with regard to damaged testicles? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> it <b>to</b> teach that one is liable for <b>sprinkling the blood.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But he derives this from</b> the phrase: <b>“Upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which indicates that one may not sacrifice any part of such an animal on the altar, even its blood. The Gemara answers: With regard to that phrase, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that it is simply <b>the</b> normal <b>manner of the verse that it speaks like this.</b> It does not teach any additional <i>halakha</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:22 | “Upon the altar” | Temurah 7a:6 | The Gemara presents <b>an alternative version</b> of the discussion. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> One violates a prohibition <b>for the collection of the blood as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed,</b> or torn, or cut, <b>you shall not offer</b> unto the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>This</b> verse is referring to <b>the collection of the blood. And he derives</b> the prohibition against <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“Upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 22:22). |
| Leviticus 22:22 | by fire of them | Yoma 63b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do you say that</b> the scapegoat <b>is disqualified</b> by a <b>blemish?</b> A blemish disqualifies only a sacrificial offering, and the scapegoat is not a sacrificial offering. The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> based upon the verse: “Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a growth, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the Lord, <b>nor make</b> an offering <b>by fire of them</b> upon the altar to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:22). The phrase: Nor make an offering by fire of them; <b>these are the fats</b> of blemished animals, which may not be sacrificed on the altar. |
| Leviticus 22:23 | the verse states: “Either a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short… | Chullin 80b:7 | It is derived from the fact that, in the middle of the passage prohibiting blemished animals from being sacrificed upon the altar, <b>the verse states: “Either a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short…</b>but for a vow it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23). Since this passage is already discussing a bull and lamb, it is unnecessary to mention them. Rather, this verse <b>taught about</b> all of <b>the disqualifications of the bull and of the lamb,</b> including that of an animal whose time has not yet arrived, <b>that</b> if one offers an animal with one of those disqualifications, <b>he</b> violates the prohibition <b>of: It shall not be accepted.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:23 | “It shall not be accepted” | Menachot 25a:10 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> about blemished animals: <b>“It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:23), and: “But whatsoever has a blemish that you shall not bring; <b>for it shall not be acceptable for you”</b> (Leviticus 22:20), teaching that in no case are blemished animals accepted as offerings, even due to the frontplate. |
| Leviticus 22:23 | a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short, you may offer it as a free-will offering | Pesachim 42a:1 | <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Either <b>a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short, you may offer it as a free-will offering</b> [to the Temple treasury]; but for a vow [as a sacrifice] it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23). From here we learn that <b>it,</b> i.e., a blemished animal, <b>you</b> may <b>consecrate for maintaining the Temple, but you</b> may <b>not consecrate unblemished</b> animals <b>for maintaining the Temple.</b> In other words, any animal fit to be sacrificed as an offering may not be consecrated for maintaining the Temple but only as an offering. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Whoever consecrates unblemished</b> animals <b>for maintaining the Temple transgresses a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:23 | and these are inherent disqualifications. | Temurah 17a:15 | <b>Rav Adda</b> raised a difficulty with regard to this answer and <b>said to Rava:</b> Is the disqualification of a blemished animal always because it is lacking a limb? <b>But isn’t</b> the phrase: <b>Too long or closed</b> hooves, <b>written in the passage</b> of the Torah addressing blemishes that disqualify an animal; <b>and these are inherent disqualifications.</b> The verse states: “Either a bull or a lamb that has any limb too long or closed hooves, you may offer for a voluntary offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23). |
| Leviticus 22:23 | “But for a vow it shall not be accepted” | Temurah 5b:23 | The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states</b> with regard to blemished animals: <b>“But for a vow it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:23). Since the verse specifies only <b>that it is</b> its sacrifice <b>which does not effect acceptance,</b> one may <b>consequently</b> infer that if one <b>consecrates</b> them, <b>they are</b> still <b>consecrated.</b> But in general, transgressions are not effective. |
| Leviticus 22:23 | that may you offer for a gift; | Temurah 6a:1 | “Either a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short, <b>that may you offer for a gift;</b> but for a vow it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23). <b>This</b> verse teaches that only blemished animals may be <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance. And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who consecrates unblemished</b> animals for <b>Temple maintenance, even though he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:23 | that has anything too long or too short” | Temurah 7a:11 | <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said to</b> Reish Lakish: The blemishes mentioned in the phrase in the verse that states: “Either a bull or a lamb <b>that has anything too long or too short”</b> (Leviticus 22:23), <b>are written in the passage</b> that prohibits the sacrifice of blemished animals, <b>and</b> animals such as <b>these are blemished from the outset.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:23 | Why did Rabbi Zeira say | Zevachim 114b:1 | <b>should also receive lashes</b> for sacrificing it, just as one would for violating other Torah prohibitions. <b>Why did Rabbi Zeira say</b> elsewhere that one who slaughters, inside the Temple courtyard, an offering whose time has not yet arrived does not receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of: “It shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23), which is the general prohibition against sacrificing animals that are not fit to be sacrificed. Rabbi Zeira explains that he does not receive lashes because <b>the verse has transmuted</b> the negative precept <b>into</b> a prohibition that is stated as <b>a positive mitzva,</b> in the verse: “But from the eighth day forward it may be accepted” (Leviticus 22:27). There is no punishment of lashes for violating such a prohibition. Rabbi Yirmeya is asking that one should still receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of: “You shall not do.” |
| Leviticus 22:24 | is liable, as it is written: “Those whose testicles are bruised or crushed or detached or cut | Bekhorot 33b:16 | Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates</b> an animal <b>after one who has</b> already <b>castrated</b> it <b>is liable, as it is written: “Those whose testicles are bruised or crushed or detached or cut</b> shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>If one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> then when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether, is he <b>not all the more so</b> liable? <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves to <b>include</b> one who <b>detaches</b> the testicles <b>after</b> one who <b>cuts</b> the seminal vesicles, to indicate <b>that he is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for castrating an animal that is already sterilized. |
| Leviticus 22:24 | “And that whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut | Bekhorot 39b:6 | § The Gemara returns to the previous discussion of whether the lack of an internal organ disqualifies an offering from being sacrificed. <b>Let us say</b> that this matter is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse that provides a list of animals disqualified from the altar: <b>“And that whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b> you shall not sacrifice to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>All</b> of these blemishes <b>are</b> found <b>in the</b> animal’s <b>testicles;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:24 | shall you do so in your land” | Chagigah 14b:10 | The Gemara recounts the greatness of ben Zoma, who was an expert interpreter of the Torah and could find obscure proofs: <b>They asked ben Zoma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>castrating a dog?</b> The prohibition against castration appears alongside the sacrificial blemishes, which may imply that it is permitted to castrate an animal that cannot be sacrificed as an offering. <b>He said to them:</b> The verse states “That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, you shall not offer to God, nor <b>shall you do so in your land”</b> (Leviticus 22:24), from which we learn: With regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>that is in your land, you shall not do</b> such a thing. <b>They</b> also <b>asked ben Zoma:</b> A woman considered <b>to be a virgin who became pregnant, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>A High Priest</b> may marry only a virgin; is he permitted to marry her? The answer depends on the following: <b>Are we concerned for</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel? Shmuel says:</b> |
| Leviticus 22:24 | “That whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut | Kiddushin 25b:1 | The Gemara comments that the first question with regard to castration of the testicles is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> It is stated with regard to animals that cannot be used as offerings due to blemishes: <b>“That whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b> you shall not sacrifice to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>All</b> of these blemishes <b>are</b> referring <b>to</b> the animal’s <b>testicles;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:24 | is liable, as it is written: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or detached, or cut, | Menachot 56b:3 | Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates</b> an animal <b>after one who castrates</b> it <b>is liable, as it is written: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or detached, or cut,</b> shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>If one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> then when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether is he <b>not all the more so</b> liable? <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves to <b>include</b> one who <b>detaches</b> the testicles <b>after</b> one who <b>cuts</b> the seminal vesicles, to indicate <b>that he is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for castrating an animal that is already sterilized. |
| Leviticus 22:24 | and you shall not do this in your land” | Shabbat 110b:6 | The Gemara discussed the remedy <b>for jaundice,</b> saying that one should drink <b>two</b> of the ingredients mentioned together <b>with beer, and one becomes sterile</b> from it. The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to cause sterility? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that castration of a man is prohibited? The verse states:</b> “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, shall not be offered to the Lord, <b>and you shall not do this in your land”</b> (Leviticus 22:24), meaning that <b>you shall not do it to yourselves;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> Apparently, it is prohibited to castrate a man. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> prohibition <b>applies</b> only in a case <b>where one intends</b> to castrate. <b>Here,</b> in the cure for jaundice, the sterility <b>happens on its own,</b> incidental to the treatment. Proof is cited from that which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who seeks to castrate a rooster should remove its comb and it will become castrated on its own.</b> Incidental castration is permitted. The Gemara rejects the proof. <b>Didn’t Rav Ashi say: It is arrogance that it assumes</b> when it has its comb, and when the comb is removed it becomes depressed and no longer procreates. However, it is not actually castrated. <b>Rather,</b> apparently this remedy for jaundice is permitted only for <b>one who is castrated</b> and for whom causing sterility is not a concern. |
| Leviticus 22:24 | that one who castrates after one who castrates is liable, as it is stated: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut | Shabbat 111a:1 | <b>Everyone agrees that one who leavens</b> a meal-offering <b>after one who</b> already <b>leavened it is liable</b> for the additional leavening, <b>as it is stated: “It shall not be baked leavened”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), and it is also stated: “No offering that you sacrifice to God <b>shall be made with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). The Sages interpreted this to mean that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a Temple offering. Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates after one who castrates is liable, as it is stated: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b>, shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). Presumably, <b>if one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether <b>all the more so</b> one is liable. <b>Rather,</b> this comes to <b>include</b> that one who <b>detaches after one who cuts is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for sterilizing one who is already castrated. <b>Rather,</b> we must say that it is permitted to use a remedy that causes sterility <b>in an old man</b> who is no longer capable of procreating. |
| Leviticus 22:24 | The verse states: “That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, | Temurah 7a:2 | § <b>The Master said</b> above: The Sages said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who sacrifices a blemished animal violates a prohibition against <b>the collection of the blood as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut,</b> you shall not offer unto the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). The phrase “You shall not offer unto the Lord” is apparently superfluous, as the Torah already stated earlier: “But whatever has a blemish, you shall not offer” (Leviticus 22:20). Rather, <b>this</b> extra phrase is referring to <b>the collection of the blood,</b> for <b>which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said</b> that one is liable. |
| Leviticus 22:24 | you shall not offer | Temurah 7a:6 | The Gemara presents <b>an alternative version</b> of the discussion. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> One violates a prohibition <b>for the collection of the blood as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed,</b> or torn, or cut, <b>you shall not offer</b> unto the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>This</b> verse is referring to <b>the collection of the blood. And he derives</b> the prohibition against <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“Upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 22:22). |
| Leviticus 22:25 | because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them” | Avodah Zarah23b:8 | The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the red <b>heifer is different: Since a blemish disqualifies it, a matter of licentiousness and</b> a matter of <b>idol worship also disqualify it, as it is written:</b> “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these, <b>because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them”</b> (Leviticus 22:25). This verse indicates that corruption is considered a blemish, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption is stated,</b> it <b>is</b> a reference to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:25 | because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them” | Bekhorot 57a:11 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> does <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy, <b>but these</b> categories listed in the <i>baraita</i> <b>are included by the Merciful One</b> in the animal tithe. <b>As it is written</b> with regard to those animals that may not be brought as offerings: “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these, <b>because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them”</b> (Leviticus 22:25). This verse indicates that corruption is considered a blemish, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term: <b>Corruption, is stated,</b> it <b>is</b> a reference to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:25 | “Because their corruption [ moshḥatam ] is in them, there is a blemish in them” | Chullin 23a:2 | As it could <b>enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of disqualified offerings: <b>“Because their corruption [<i>moshḥatam</i>] is in them, there is a blemish in them”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), referring to two types of disqualifications: Corruption and blemish, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption [<i>hashḥata</i>] is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> The Gemara cites proofs for this claim: Corruption is referring to <b>matters of licentiousness, as it is written: “For all flesh had corrupted [<i>hishḥit</i>] their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sexual intercourse. |
| Leviticus 22:25 | “And from the hand of a stranger you shall not offer the bread of your God from any of these, because… | Sotah 46a:9 | The Gemara poses another question: <b>But this</b> <i>halakha</i> that prohibited labor does not disqualify offerings <b>is also derived from here,</b> a verse with regard to the sacrifice of blemished animals: <b>“And from the hand of a stranger you shall not offer the bread of your God from any of these, because…</b>there is a blemish in them” (Leviticus 22:25). This verse emphasizes that it is only <b>“these,”</b> i.e., blemished animals, that <b>you may not sacrifice, but you may sacrifice sacred</b> animals <b>that have been used for labor.</b> Since this verse is discussing the possibility of accepting offerings from a gentile, who presumably also performed prohibited labor with the animal, this demonstrates that prohibited labor does not disqualify animals from being sacrificed as offerings. |
| Leviticus 22:25 | because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; | Temurah 28b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> animals with a temporary blemish cannot be sacrificed at present, nor can they be redeemed. Rather, <b>they require a permanent blemish</b> for one <b>to redeem them on account of</b> that blemish, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the disqualification of blemished animals from the altar: “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these, <b>because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them;</b> they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25). |
| Leviticus 22:25 | “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer | Temurah 7a:4 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But also</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> one may claim that <b>this is the</b> normal <b>manner of the verse.</b> Why does he derive a <i>halakha</i> from this phrase? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> He does not derive liability for sprinkling of the blood from the phrase “upon the altar.” <b>Rather, from where does he</b> derive the prohibition against <b>collection of the blood? He derives it from this</b> verse: <b>“Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer</b> the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them; there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25). <b>This</b> verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>the collection of the blood</b> when sacrificing a blemished animal, for <b>which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said</b> that one is liable. |
| Leviticus 22:25 | “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer | Temurah 7a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> how can he then derive the prohibition against collection of the blood of a blemished animal from the phrase “You shall not offer”? After all, <b>he requires this</b> phrase <b>to</b> render prohibited sacrifice on <b>a private altar.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so. Rather, where does he</b> find another instance of the term <b>“shall offer” for</b> prohibiting <b>collection</b> of the blood? From the following verse: <b>“Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer</b> the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them; there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25). <b>This</b> verse is referring to <b>the collection of the blood.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:25 | As it is written: “Because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; | Yoma 64a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the case of an animal with a temporary blemish, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it is written: “Because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them;</b> they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25), which teaches us: It is when the <b>blemish is in them that they shall not be accepted; but if their blemish passes, they shall be accepted.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:25 | that it is written: “They shall not be accepted” | Zevachim 29a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And ben Azzai,</b> who interprets the term “it” as excluding vows that were fulfilled late, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>that the verse is speaking of</b> the <b>offering and not of</b> the <b>priest?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>he derives it from</b> the statement <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i></b> that the verse rules out disqualification on the third day itself. This would be necessary only if the verse is referring to the offering and not the priest. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “They shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), <b>and: “It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), it is evident that the verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>an offering,</b> which may be accepted or may not be accepted. |
| Leviticus 22:25 | the Merciful One excludes | Zevachim 77b:3 | <b>Rather, the reason of Rabbi Eliezer</b> is that with regard to the prohibition against sacrificing a blemished animal upon the altar, <b>the Merciful One excludes</b> certain cases. After listing the various disqualifying blemishes, the verse states: “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25). This teaches that <b>it is</b> only if there is <b>a blemish</b> clearly <b>in them that they shall not be accepted; but</b> if they were sacrificed <b>by means of a mixture they shall be accepted.</b> This exclusion is stated only with regard to blemished animals, not with regard to animals that copulated with people, and consequently the limbs of these animals are not brought up to the altar even if they became intermingled with the limbs of fit offerings. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | a day-old ram is called a ram. A day-old bull is called a bull, as it is written: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born” | Bava Kamma65b:17 | <b>Rava says:</b> There is in fact no change in name here, as even <b>a day-old bull is called a bull,</b> and even <b>a day-old ram is called a ram. A day-old bull is called a bull, as it is written: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born”</b> (Leviticus 22:27). |
| Leviticus 22:27 | But isn’t it taught | Bava Kamma77b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>every</b> instance of the word <b>“or”</b> serve <b>to include</b> diverse kinds? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother and from the eighth day onward it may be accepted as a fire-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). The phrase <b>“a bull or a sheep”</b> serves to <b>exclude diverse kinds,</b> i.e., an animal of diverse kinds may not be brought as an offering. The phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> serves to <b>exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another, i.e., a sheep that is the offspring of two sheep but that looks like a goat, or vice versa. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | “A bull or a sheep” | Bava Kamma78a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>it is also stated</b> in the first part of the verse: <b>“A bull or a sheep”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which are two animals <b>from which you cannot produce diverse kinds. And</b> accordingly, <b>let us include</b> an animal of diverse kinds as being fit for sacrifice on the altar on that account. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the verse: “Or a goat,” serves <b>to exclude</b> a type of animal from being fit for sacrifice on the altar, it may be inferred that the <b>first clause:</b> “A bull or a sheep,” also serves <b>to exclude</b> a type of animal from being fit for sacrifice on the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> one could equally argue that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the first clause</b> of the verse serves <b>to include</b> a type of animal as being fit for sacrifice on the altar, the <b>latter clause also</b> serves <b>to include</b> a type of animal as being fit for sacrifice on the altar. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | it is written explicitly with regard to them: “A bull or a sheep” | Bava Kamma78a:3 | The Gemara has established that when the Torah uses the word <i>seh</i> (Exodus 21:37) in the context of theft it does not serve to exclude animals of diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> what is meant by <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rava says</b> with regard to the verse: “The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases, teaching that <b>wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Rava state this principle? <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>it is written explicitly with regard to them: “A bull or a sheep”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which, as taught in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>, serves to <b>exclude diverse kinds.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:27 | sacrificial | Bava Kamma78a:4 | <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>animal tithe,</b> concerning which it is written: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock [<i>tzon</i>], any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), this principle is not necessary either. The reason is that the exclusion of diverse kinds can be <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>“under”</b> in this verse, and the word <b>“under”</b> in a verse that deals with <b>sacrificial</b> animals: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother” (Leviticus 22:27). This verbal analogy, from which many <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe are derived, indicates that diverse kinds are not subject to animal tithe, just as they cannot be used for an offering. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | As it is taught | Bekhorot 12a:15 | Now, <b>to what</b> <i>halakha</i> is this <i>baraita</i> referring? <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., to the fact that such an animal is unfit for sacrifice as an offering, why does the <i>baraita</i> derive its status from that of a hybrid? <b>From</b> the same verse <b>where</b> one derives that the Torah <b>excludes a hybrid</b> as an offering, one can derive that <b>it</b> also <b>excludes</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> an animal of another type. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in the verse: “When a bull, or a lamb, or a goat, is brought forth…it may be accepted as an offering…to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), the words <b>“a bull, or a lamb”</b> are interpreted as <b>excluding a hybrid,</b> and the words <b>“or a goat”</b> are interpreted as <b>excluding</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> an animal of another type. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | “Under” | Bekhorot 12a:17 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps it is referring <b>to</b> the mitzva of the animal <b>tithe</b> and teaches that an animal that resembles an animal of another type is not tithed with the other animals. This ruling is also unnecessary, as it is <b>derived</b> via a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which is stated with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and the word: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), which is stated in the context of animal tithe. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring <b>to</b> the lamb that is used to redeem <b>a firstborn donkey,</b> and it teaches that a lamb that resembles an animal of another type is unfit for use as redemption. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | derived from there: | Bekhorot 17a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is <b>this derived from here?</b> Isn’t it <b>derived from there:</b> “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth” (Leviticus 22:27), as the phrase <b>“a bull, or a sheep”</b> serves <b>to exclude diverse kinds,</b> i.e., an animal born from two different species of animals, while the phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> a different species? |
| Leviticus 22:27 | under | Bekhorot 54b:4 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>if</b> the verse <b>had written: All the animal tithe, I would say</b> that the requirement to tithe animals applies <b>even to undomesticated animals,</b> this is not so. The reason is that one <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the animal tithe <b>from sacrificial</b> animals, via a verbal analogy of the terms “under” and “under.” With regard to sacrificial animals it states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days <b>under</b> its mother, but from the eighth day onward it may be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), and with regard to animal tithe it states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes <b>under</b> the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). It is derived through this verbal analogy that just as an undomesticated animal cannot be consecrated as an offering, so too, it cannot be tithed. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | “Under” | Bekhorot 57a:10 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> as for <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>if he derives</b> the verbal analogy of: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), and: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), <b>from</b> the verse referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, then <b>these</b> types listed in the <i>baraita</i> should <b>also not</b> enter the pen to be tithed, as they are all disqualified from being sacrificed. <b>And if he does not derive</b> the verbal analogy from sacrificial animals, <b>from where</b> does he derive the exemption of <b>these</b> categories listed in the mishna, e.g., one whose time has not yet arrived and an orphan? |
| Leviticus 22:27 | As the Sages taught | Bekhorot 57a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., the fact that those animals are not included in the animal tithe, derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses offerings in general: “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, then it shall be seven days under its mother, but from the eighth day onward it may be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). The phrase <b>“a bull or a sheep”</b> serves to <b>exclude</b> an animal born <b>from diverse kinds; “or a goat”</b> serves to <b>exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another, e.g., a sheep that is the offspring of two sheep but which looks like a goat, or vice versa; <b>“when…is born”</b> serves to <b>exclude</b> an animal <b>born by caesarean section; “then it shall be seven days”</b> serves to <b>exclude</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived; <b>“under its mother”</b> serves to <b>exclude an orphan.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:27 | “Under its mother” | Bekhorot 57a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: From where is it derived that these <i>halakhot</i> also apply to animal tithe? <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> it is learned by a verbal analogy from the term “under.” It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to animal tithe: “Whatever passes <b>under the rod”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there,</b> with regard to all offerings: <b>“Under its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of all offerings, the verse serves to <b>exclude all these categories, so too here,</b> with regard to animal tithe, the verse serves to <b>exclude all these categories. And just as here,</b> with regard to animal tithe, the verse serves to <b>exclude a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as the verse states: “Whatever passes under the rod,” and a <i>tereifa</i> is unable to pass unaided, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to all offerings, the verse serves to <b>exclude a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:27 | to the Most High | Chullin 115a:8 | The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>A mother and its offspring</b> slaughtered on the same day <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption, as this too is a practice made abominable. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One prohibits</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, i.e., that is less than eight days old, as an offering <b>to the Most High</b> (Leviticus 22:27), learn <b>by inference that</b> such animals are <b>permitted to ordinary</b> people for consumption. The offspring of a mother slaughtered that day is also considered an animal whose time has not yet arrived, since the prohibition against slaughtering it is limited to that day. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | as it is taught | Chullin 38a:17 | <b>Rava said: The convulsion that</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> is an indication of life is a convulsion <b>at the conclusion of</b> the act of <b>slaughter. Rava said: From where do I say</b> that this is the case? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother; and from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). The phrase <b>“a bull</b> |
| Leviticus 22:27 | as the verse states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born | Chullin 78a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> in a single day <b>applies to sacrificial</b> animals? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born</b>…but from the eighth day and forward it may be accepted for an offering…to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), <b>and it is written</b> in the <b>following</b> verse: <b>“And whether it be a bull or a sheep, you shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day.”</b> The juxtaposition of the verses <b>teaches with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring that it applies to sacrificial</b> animals as well. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | which the verse states: “From the eighth day and forward it may be accepted | Chullin 81a:1 | <b>transmuted it</b> from the standard prohibition of: It shall not be accepted, which is violated in the case of the other disqualifications, <b>into</b> a prohibition that stems from <b>a positive mitzva. What is the reasoning</b> by which this is derived? It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “From the eighth day and forward it may be accepted</b> for an offering” (Leviticus 22:27), which teaches that <b>from the eighth day</b> after its birth, <b>yes,</b> it may be sacrificed as an offering, but <b>initially,</b> before the eighth day, <b>no,</b> it may not be sacrificed. Therefore, this is <b>a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva,</b> which is not considered a negative prohibition for which one is flogged, but rather <b>a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:27 | of Rabbi Aptoriki, as Rabbi Aptoriki raises a contradiction: It is written: “Then it shall be seven days with its mother” | Chullin 81a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> verse <b>is required for</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Aptoriki, as Rabbi Aptoriki raises a contradiction: It is written: “Then it shall be seven days with its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), indicating that on <b>the night</b> after the seventh day it is already <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that verse: <b>“From the eighth day and forward it may be accepted,”</b> indicating that <b>from the eighth day forward, yes,</b> it is fit, but on <b>the night</b> before it is <b>not.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:27 | a firstborn | Meilah 13a:11 | The other <i>halakha</i>, that the <b>milk of a sacrificial</b> animal is prohibited, is <b>also derived</b> through a verbal analogy, specifically the terms <b>“its mother”</b> and <b>“its mother,” from</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> offering. With regard to sacrificial animals the verse states: “When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is born, it shall be seven days under its mother” (Leviticus 22:27), and in the case of the firstborn offering it is stated: “Seven days it shall be with its mother” (Exodus 22:29). Just as one is liable for misusing all of a firstborn offering, so too, one is liable for misusing the milk of a sacrificial animal, i.e., the milk is forbidden, as it is part of the sacrificial animal. Consequently, its offspring may not suckle from the mother. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | like the acceptance of a valid | Menachot 16b:3 | The Gemara provides the source for this claim. <b>As the Master said</b> that the verse states with regard to <i>piggul</i>: <b>“It shall</b> not <b>be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), which indicates that <b>the acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering is <b>like the acceptance of a valid</b> offering, of which the verse states: “It shall be accepted” (Leviticus 22:27), and <b>just as</b> there is no <b>acceptance of a valid</b> offering <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed, so too</b> there is no lack of <b>acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering, i.e., it is not rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed.</b> That is to say, in the absence of one of its permitting factors it does not become <i>piggul</i>. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | “Its mother” | Niddah 40a:16 | The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> more <b>reasonable for</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a consecrated animal <b>from a firstborn</b> animal, rather than from the <i>halakha</i> of childbirth, <b>as</b> it is written with regard to a consecrated animal: <b>“Its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), and it is likewise written <b>with regard to</b> a firstborn animal: <b>“Its mother”</b> (Exodus 22:29). The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary, he should derive</b> it <b>from human</b> births, <b>as</b> that would be a derivation of the <i>halakha</i> concerning consecrated animals that are <b>ordinary,</b> i.e., not firstborns, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning human births of children that are <b>ordinary,</b> and not firstborns. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | a bull or a sheep or a goat | Niddah 41a:9 | <b>And furthermore,</b> is the disqualification of an animal born of a mixture of <b>diverse kinds derived from here?</b> No, it is <b>derived from elsewhere,</b> as taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When <b>a bull or a sheep or a goat</b> is born, it shall be seven days under its mother; but from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering” (Leviticus 22:27). The term <b>“a bull”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> from being used as an offering, The phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another, i.e., a sheep that is the offspring of sheep but that looks like a goat, or vice versa. Once again, as these animals cannot be consecrated at all, it is not necessary for the Torah to teach that they must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | and from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering | Shabbat 135b:13 | The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i> where <b>it was taught</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: With regard to people, any</b> child <b>that remains</b> alive <b>thirty days</b> after birth <b>is no</b> longer suspected of being a <b>stillborn,</b> and is assumed to be a regular child who will go on living. Proof is cited from that which <b>is stated</b> with regard to the laws of redemption and valuations: <b>“And their redemption, from a month old you shall redeem</b> according to your valuation, five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the Sanctuary; it is twenty <i>gera</i>” (Numbers 18:16), indicating that no value is ascribed to an infant less than a month old, as its viability is uncertain. Likewise, a newborn <b>animal</b> that survives for <b>eight days is no</b> longer suspected of being a <b>stillborn,</b> as <b>it is stated:</b> “When a bullock or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother; <b>and from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering</b> made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). |
| Leviticus 22:27 | it may be accepted as an offering by fire to the Lord” | Yoma 63b:3 | The Gemara asks about this halakhic midrash: <b>Does</b> the expression <b>“to the Lord”</b> come <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> based upon the verse: “When a bull, or a lamb, or a goat, is born it shall be seven days under its mother; but from the eighth day on <b>it may be accepted as an offering by fire to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:27). An offering by fire to the Lord: <b>These are</b> offerings <b>by fire,</b> which are sacrificed on the altar and which may not be sacrificed before their proper time. |
| Leviticus 22:27 | a positive mitzva, | Zevachim 114b:1 | <b>should also receive lashes</b> for sacrificing it, just as one would for violating other Torah prohibitions. <b>Why did Rabbi Zeira say</b> elsewhere that one who slaughters, inside the Temple courtyard, an offering whose time has not yet arrived does not receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of: “It shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23), which is the general prohibition against sacrificing animals that are not fit to be sacrificed. Rabbi Zeira explains that he does not receive lashes because <b>the verse has transmuted</b> the negative precept <b>into</b> a prohibition that is stated as <b>a positive mitzva,</b> in the verse: “But from the eighth day forward it may be accepted” (Leviticus 22:27). There is no punishment of lashes for violating such a prohibition. Rabbi Yirmeya is asking that one should still receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of: “You shall not do.” |
| Leviticus 22:27 | then it shall be seven days with its mother” | Zevachim 12a:14 | <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Appetoriki, as Rabbi Appetoriki raises a contradiction: It is written:</b> “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, <b>then it shall be seven days with its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27); <b>consequently,</b> on the following <b>night,</b> i.e., the night before the eighth day, <b>it is fit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And it is written</b> subsequently in that verse: <b>“But from the eighth day and on it may be accepted</b> for an offering made by fire unto the Lord”; <b>consequently,</b> on the previous <b>night,</b> i.e., the night before the eighth day, <b>it is not</b> yet <b>fit.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:28 | to slaughter | Avodah Zarah5b:6 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 83a): <b>On four occasions during the year one who sells an animal to another is required to inform him: I sold the mother of</b> this animal today for the buyer <b>to slaughter</b> it, or: <b>I sold the daughter of</b> this animal today for the buyer <b>to slaughter</b> it. This notification is necessary so that this buyer will not slaughter the animal on the same day that its mother or its young is slaughtered, thereby violating the prohibition: “You shall not kill it and its young both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28). |
| Leviticus 22:28 | it and its offspring | Beitzah 37a:11 | Rav Yosef elaborates on his statement: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a cow and her calf, which may not be slaughtered on the same day because of the biblical prohibition: “You shall not kill <b>it and its offspring</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>fell into a pit</b> on a Festival, and their owner wishes to take them out, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it and</b> then <b>slaughter it, and</b> as for <b>the second, he provides it sustenance in its place so that it will not die</b> in the pit. It is prohibited to undertake the strenuous task of raising an animal out of a pit except for the purpose of eating it on the Festival. Therefore, since one cannot slaughter both animals on the Festival, only one can be raised, while the other should be sustained in its place until after the Festival. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | one incurs [ sofeg ] the forty | Chullin 78a:6 | <b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>itself and its offspring,</b> both of which are <b>non-sacred,</b> and slaughters them <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of</b> the animals <b>are fit</b> for consumption, <b>but</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs [<i>sofeg</i>] the forty</b> lashes for violating the prohibition: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28). |
| Leviticus 22:28 | or | Chullin 78b:1 | concerning the verse: “These are the animals that you may eat: An ox, a <i>seh</i> of sheep, and a <i>seh</i> of goats” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this</b> verse <b>establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases: <b>Wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>only to exclude</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Hebrew word <i>seh</i> denotes either a sheep or a goat. The offspring of diverse kinds, which is neither a sheep nor a goat, does not qualify as a <i>seh</i>. The Gemara answers that with regard to a mother and its offspring, <b>the verse states:</b> “Whether it be a bull <b>or</b> a sheep” (Leviticus 22:28), and the “or” is superfluous there and serves <b>to include</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:28 | it | Chullin 78b:10 | Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A bull or a sheep, <b>it</b> and its offspring” (Leviticus 22:28). The superfluous word “it” indicates that this applies to only <b>one</b> parent, <b>but not</b> to <b>two.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>After the verse separated</b> the parents, rendering the prohibition applicable to only one of them, <b>I merited</b> returning <b>to the logical inference</b> mentioned earlier: The Torah <b>rendered one obligated here</b> not to slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>rendered one obligated</b> to dispatch the mother <b>with regard to a mother bird with its chicks. Just as when it rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks,</b> the obligation applies <b>to females but not to males, so too, when it rendered one obligated here,</b> the obligation applies <b>to females but not to males.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:28 | its offspring” | Chullin 78b:11 | <b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that one can refute this, that refutation can be countered by the following derivation: The verse states: “It and <b>its offspring”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), indicating that this applies to <b>that</b> parent <b>whose offspring clings to it.</b> This serves to <b>exclude</b> the <b>male</b> parent, <b>whose offspring does not cling to it.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:28 | the verse states: “A bull or a sheep…it and its offspring” | Chullin 78b:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the word “or” <b>is still necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If it were stated: A bull, and a sheep, and its offspring</b> you shall not slaughter in one day, <b>I would say:</b> One is not liable <b>unless he slaughters a bull, and a sheep, and the offspring</b> of one of them in a single day. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A bull or a sheep…it and its offspring”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), to teach that one is liable even for slaughtering either of them and its offspring. <b>What, is it not from</b> the word <b>“or”</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>“it,”</b> and the offspring of diverse kinds are included in the prohibition due to the word “or.” |
| Leviticus 22:28 | and its offspring | Chullin 79b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> surrounding the birth of this <i>koy</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is the result <b>of a goat that mates with a doe, and she gives birth, and one slaughters her and her offspring</b> on the same day, that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say: All concede in</b> the case where <b>she is a doe and her offspring is a goat,</b> because she mated with a goat, <b>that</b> one who slaughters them both on the same day <b>is exempt</b> from lashes for violating the prohibition of a mother and its offspring? He is exempt because <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And whether it be a bull or <b>a sheep,</b> you shall not slaughter it <b>and its offspring</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), indicating that the prohibition applies to a domesticated animal and its offspring, <b>but not</b> to an undomesticated animal and its offspring, such as <b>a doe and its offspring.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:28 | “A sheep | Chullin 79b:4 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps this <i>koy</i> is the product <b>of a deer that mates with a female goat, and she gives birth, and one slaughters her and her offspring</b> on the same day. <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say: All concede</b> that <b>in</b> the case where <b>she is a goat and her offspring is a deer</b> because she mated with a deer, <b>that</b> one who slaughters them both on the same day <b>is liable?</b> He is liable because <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“A sheep</b>…and its offspring” (Leviticus 22:28), indicating that the prohibition applies to a domesticated animal such as a sheep <b>and its offspring</b> of <b>any</b> species, even if it is an undomesticated animal. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | a mother and its offspring, | Chullin 81b:5 | All agree that <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>and it becomes a carcass by his hand</b> because the slaughter was invalid, <b>or one who stabs</b> an animal, <b>or one who uproots</b> the windpipe and the gullet, is <b>exempt with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring,</b> as it is written: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), and in these cases, no ritual slaughter was performed. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | “It and its offspring” | Chullin 82a:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement in the mishna that if one slaughters two calves and thereafter slaughters their mother he incurs the forty lashes, the Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does he receive lashes? After all, the phrase: <b>“It and its offspring”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), is what <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah, <b>and not: Its offspring and it.</b> The Gemara answers: That thought should <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase <b>“it and its offspring” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the prohibition includes slaughtering the animal <b>itself</b> first <b>and its offspring</b> afterward. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the prohibition also includes the case of slaughtering the offspring <b>itself</b> first <b>and its mother</b> afterward? |
| Leviticus 22:28 | states: “You shall not slaughter [ tishḥatu ] | Chullin 82a:14 | It is derived in the following manner: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥatu</i>]</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>two</b> people who are prohibited from slaughtering on the same day, as the word “slaughter” is phrased in the plural. <b>How so?</b> If, during the course of a single day, there is <b>one</b> person <b>who slaughters the cow and</b> then <b>another who slaughters</b> that cow’s <b>mother, and</b> then there is <b>another</b> person <b>who slaughters</b> that cow’s <b>offspring, the two latter</b> people <b>are liable,</b> the first of them for slaughtering the mother after its offspring was slaughtered, and the second person for slaughtering the offspring after its mother was slaughtered. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | “You shall not slaughter [ tishḥatu ]” | Chullin 82b:1 | The Gemara challenges: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for</b> the prohibition <b>itself,</b> and it cannot be used to teach this additional <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that the verse teaches only the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring in one day, <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write: You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥot</i>],</b> in the singular. For <b>what</b> reason did the Torah write: <b>“You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥatu</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), in the plural? It is to teach that two different people are prohibited from slaughtering, as explained earlier. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | itself and its offspring: “One day” | Chullin 83a:15 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b> Therefore, one may slaughter an animal during the day and slaughter its offspring that night, but one may not slaughter an animal at night and slaughter its offspring the following day. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Zoma derived this</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated in the act of Creation: “One day”</b> (Genesis 1:5), <b>and it is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring: “One day”</b> (Leviticus 22:28). <b>Just as</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated in the act of Creation, the day follows the night, so too</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:28 | one day” | Chullin 83b:1 | § <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in <b>one day”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), is referring to a special day, and it indicates that <b>a special day requires a proclamation</b> to prevent buyers from slaughtering an animal together with its offspring on that day. <b>From here</b> is derived that which is <b>stated</b> in the mishna: <b>On four occasions during the year,</b> which are special days, <b>one who sells an animal to another must inform him:</b> I sold its mother for slaughter, or: I sold its offspring for slaughter. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | slaughtered outside | Chullin 85a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason that Rabbi Meir</b> holds that ineffective slaughter is considered an act of slaughter in the case of <b>a mother and its offspring? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> He <b>derives</b> his opinion by means of a verbal analogy of the terms <b>slaughter</b> and <b>slaughter, from</b> the case of sacrificial animals <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple. The verse states with regard to a mother and its offspring: “It and its offspring you shall not slaughter [<i>lo tishḥatu</i>] in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), and the verse states with regard to sacrificial animals: “Or that is slaughtered [<i>yishḥat</i>] outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). |
| Leviticus 22:28 | Rabbi Yehoshua. As it was taught | Shabbat 124a:17 | <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna, which rules that it is prohibited, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer; that</b> mishna, which rules that it is permitted, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is prohibited to slaughter a mother animal and its offspring on the same day, as it is stated: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28). With regard to <b>it and its offspring that fell into a pit</b> on a Festival, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it, and</b> then <b>slaughter it; and</b> with regard to <b>the second one, one may provide it sustenance in its place</b> in the pit <b>so that it will not die. Rabbi Yehoshua says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it, and</b> then reconsider and <b>not slaughter it, and</b> then <b>employ artifice</b> and say that he reconsidered and wants to slaughter the other, <b>and raise the second. If he</b> so <b>desires, he slaughters this</b> one; <b>if he</b> so <b>desires, he slaughters that</b> one. Apparently, Rabbi Yehoshua permits certain actions on a Festival due to financial considerations, and does not issue decrees in those cases. |
| Leviticus 22:28 | you shall not slaughter | Yoma 64a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is it prohibited in a case like this? The Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah: “And whether it be a cow or ewe, <b>you shall not slaughter</b> it and its young on one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>and this</b> act of pushing the scapegoat off the cliff <b>is not</b> a ritual <b>slaughter.</b> Consequently, the prohibition against slaughtering a mother animal and its offspring should not apply. The Gemara answers: <b>They say in the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, that <b>pushing it</b> off <b>the cliff,</b> which is the manner in which the scapegoat is supposed to be killed, <b>is</b> considered <b>its slaughter.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:30 | “You shall not leave over” | Yoma 74b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include non-sacred food, which is not</b> associated with any positive mitzva to <b>arise</b> and <b>eat,</b> i.e., there is no obligation to eat non-sacred food; <b>but I will not include <i>teruma</i>, which</b> one is required to <b>arise</b> and <b>eat,</b> as priests are commanded to eat <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states “you shall afflict”</b> and <b>“and you shall afflict your souls.”</b> The Torah <b>includes</b> <i>teruma</i> as well in the foods one is prohibited to eat on Yom Kippur. <b>I will include <i>teruma</i>, which is not</b> subject to the command: <b>“You shall not leave over”</b> (Leviticus 22:30), since <i>teruma</i> need not be consumed within a specific time, <b>but I will not include sacred food,</b> which is subject to the command <b>“you shall not leave over”;</b> it is prohibited to leave the meat uneaten after a certain amount of time. Therefore, <b>the verse states “you shall afflict”</b> and <b>“and you shall afflict your souls,”</b> to <b>include</b> the category of sacred food in the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur. Consequently, the Gemara has demonstrated that it is prohibited to eat any type of food on Yom Kippur. |
| Leviticus 22:32 | the verse states: “And you shall not profane My holy name” | Avodah Zarah27b:11 | <b>And</b> why does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> disagree with ben Dama? He maintains that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>in private, but in public</b> one <b>may not</b> transgress a prohibition even to save a life. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> oppressors <b>say to a person: Worship an idol and you</b> will <b>not be killed, that one should worship</b> the idol <b>and not be killed? The verse states: “He shall live by them,” and not that he should die by them.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even in public.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall not profane My holy name”</b> (Leviticus 22:32). |
| Leviticus 22:32 | The Merciful One then wrote: “And you shall not profane My holy name” | Avodah Zarah54a:5 | <b>The Merciful One then wrote: “And you shall not profane My holy name”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), indicating <b>that</b> the prohibition against idol worship applies <b>even in</b> a case of <b>duress,</b> as this constitutes a desecration of God’s name. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>This</b> verse is referring to worshipping under duress <b>in private, and that</b> verse is referring to worshipping under duress <b>in public.</b> In private one is not required to sacrifice his life in order to refrain from idol worship. In public one is required to sacrifice his life rather than engage in idol worship. Therefore, if one engaged in idol worship in public, even under duress, the object of idol worship is forbidden. |
| Leviticus 22:32 | As it is stated: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel” | Berakhot 21b:4 | <b>Similarly, Rav Adda bar Ahava stated,</b> in accordance with the second opinion: <b>From where is it derived that an individual may not recite <i>kedusha</i></b> alone? <b>As it is stated: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), <b>any expression of sanctity may not be</b> recited in a quorum of <b>fewer than ten</b> men. |
| Leviticus 22:32 | as the verse states: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel” | Megillah 23b:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that ten people are needed in each of these cases, derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), which indicates that <b>any expression of sanctity may not be</b> recited in a quorum of <b>fewer than ten</b> men. |
| Leviticus 22:32 | the verse states: “Neither shall you profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed | Sanhedrin 74a:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that it is permitted to worship the idol in this circumstance <b>even in public,</b> i.e., in the presence of many people. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Neither shall you profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed</b> among the children of Israel: I am the Lord Who sanctifies you” (Leviticus 22:32). Evidently, one is not required to allow himself to be killed so as not to transgress the prohibition of idol worship when in private; but in public he must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress. |
| Leviticus 22:32 | “And I shall be sanctified among the children of Israel” | Sanhedrin 74b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> the presence of <b>how many</b> people is required so that it should be deemed <b>a public</b> act? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> An action is <b>not</b> considered <b>a public</b> act if it is performed in the presence of <b>fewer than ten people.</b> The Gemara clarifies this point: It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>we require</b> that these ten people be <b>Jews, as it is written</b> in the verse from which we derive the requirement of ten for the sanctification of God’s name: <b>“And I shall be sanctified among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asks: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if there were <b>nine Jews and one gentile</b> present? |
| Leviticus 22:32 | And it is written with regard to desecrating the name of God: “And you shall not desecrate [ teḥallelu ] My Holy Name” | Shabbat 33a:3 | <b>Due to the sin of an oath</b> taken <b>in vain and a false oath, and desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, and desecration of Shabbat, wild beasts abound</b> in the world, <b>and</b> domesticated <b>animals cease</b> to exist, <b>and human beings decrease</b> in number, <b>and the roads become desolate, as it is stated: “And if in spite of these [<i>be</i>’<i>eleh</i>] things you will not be corrected unto Me,</b> but will walk contrary unto Me casually” (Leviticus 26:23). <b>Do not read of these [<i>be</i>’<i>eleh</i>]; rather,</b> due to a vain <b>oath [<i>be</i>’<i>ala</i>]. And it is written</b> that the punishment for this is: <b>“And I will send the beast of the field among you,</b> which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate” (Leviticus 26:22). <b>And it is written with regard to a false oath: “And you shall not swear by My name falsely, so that you desecrate [<i>veḥillalta</i>] the name of your God:</b> I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). <b>And it is written with regard to desecrating the name of God: “And you shall not desecrate [<i>teḥallelu</i>] My Holy Name”</b> (Leviticus 22:32). <b>And it is written with regard to desecrating Shabbat: “Every one that desecrates it [<i>meḥaleleha</i>] shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14). <b>And derive</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] <b>desecration [<i>ḥillul</i>] of Shabbat from desecration [<i>ḥillul</i>] of a false oath.</b> Just as punishment for a false oath is desolation and wild beasts, one receives the same punishment for desecrating Shabbat and the name of God. |
| Leviticus 23:2 | the verse states: “Which you shall proclaim them [ otam ] | Rosh Hashanah24a:12 | § The mishna further teaches that after the head of the court says: It is sanctified, <b>all the people respond after him:</b> It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Which you shall proclaim them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:2). Instead of <i>otam</i>, <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>You [<i>atem</i>],</b> as though the verse stated: Which you shall proclaim, you. This superfluous word you teaches that the month must be proclaimed not only by the head of the court, but also by you, the people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it is derived from the phrase: <b>“These are [<i>hem</i>] My appointed seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:2). The term <i>hem</i> can also mean: They, which indicates that <b>they,</b> the people, <b>should</b> likewise <b>say</b> and announce <b>My appointed seasons.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:2 | that it is written: “Sacred convocations” | Rosh Hashanah24a:13 | The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the people to declare: It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified, twice?</b> The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>that it is written: “Sacred convocations”</b> (Leviticus 23:2) in the plural, which indicates that they must announce it twice. |
| Leviticus 23:2 | them [ otam ] | Rosh Hashanah25a:13 | Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: My teacher, allow me to say before you one matter that you</b> yourself once <b>taught me. He said to him: Speak. He said to him: It states</b> with respect to the Festivals: “The appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations (Leviticus 23:2). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> in their season” (Leviticus 23:4). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:37). <b>Three times</b> the verses use the term: Them [<i>otam</i>], which can also be read as you [<i>atem</i>], in plural. |
| Leviticus 23:3 | Creation, was not stated? | Bava Batra121a:2 | The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Natan learned this <i>baraita</i> and did not know how to explain it.</b> He <b>followed Rav Sheshet to Neharde’a</b> in order to ask him about it, <b>but</b> he <b>did not find him</b> there. He <b>followed him to Meḥoza</b> and <b>found him,</b> and he <b>said to him: What</b> is meant by Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement: <b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, was not stated?</b> What does he mean, as Shabbat of Creation is explicitly mentioned in that section of the Torah (Leviticus 23:3)? |
| Leviticus 23:3 | it is a Shabbat | Chullin 101b:2 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>Shabbat and Yom Kippur</b> occur on the same day, if one acted <b>unwittingly and performed</b> prohibited <b>labor, from where</b> is it derived <b>that he is liable for this by itself and for that by itself,</b> i.e., he is liable to bring two sin offerings, for having transgressed both Shabbat and Yom Kippur? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall do no manner of work; <b>it is a Shabbat</b> for the Lord in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:3), and another verse states: <b>“It is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). The term “it is” in each verse teaches that each of these days is considered independently even when it occurs together with another holy day. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering because a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists. |
| Leviticus 23:3 | dwellings” | Kiddushin 37a:14 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> But there is the case of <b>Shabbat, in which it is stated:</b> “It is a Shabbat to the Lord in all your <b>dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 23:3), <b>and</b> this mitzva <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>Shabbat is derived through</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If less stringent mitzvot apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>a stringent</b> mitzva, should apply everywhere? |
| Leviticus 23:3 | “dwelling” that the Merciful One writes with regard to Shabbat | Kiddushin 37b:10 | § The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you said</b> that <b>an obligation of the body applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“dwelling” that the Merciful One writes with regard to Shabbat</b> (Leviticus 23:3)? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to say this, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since</b> the mitzva of Shabbat <b>was written in the context of the Festivals, it should require sanctification</b> by the court, <b>like the Festivals,</b> which rely on the sanctification of the New Moon by the court. Therefore the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not required. |
| Leviticus 23:3 | Shabbat | Kiddushin 37b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> consider that <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> But there is the verse stated with regard to <b>Shabbat</b> (Leviticus 23:3), <b>in which it is stated “dwellings,” and</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: Shabbat is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. But <b>let</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>say to</b> Rabbi Akiva instead: <b>I say</b> my principle only when <b>coming and dwelling</b> are both written, and in the case of Shabbat the verse states only the term dwelling. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yishmael <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another</b> reason. <b>One</b> reason is <b>that I say</b> my principle only when <b>coming and dwelling</b> are written together. <b>And another</b> reason: With regard to <b>that which you say</b> that there is the case of <b>Shabbat, in which it is stated “dwellings,” Shabbat is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. |
| Leviticus 23:4 | “These are the appointed Festivals of the Lord, | Chagigah 18a:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> concerning the same topic: With regard to the first day of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>, the verse states: <b>“You shall do no kind of laborious work”</b> (Leviticus 23:35), followed by “seven days, you shall bring an offering made by fire to the Lord,” which <b>teaches that the performance of labor is prohibited during the intermediate Festival days;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This <b>is not necessary, since it is stated</b> earlier in that chapter: <b>“These are the appointed Festivals of the Lord,</b> holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season” (Leviticus 23:4). <b>With regard to what is the verse speaking? If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>first</b> day of the Festival, <b>it has already</b> explicitly <b>stated “a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39) with regard to that day; <b>if</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>seventh, it has already stated “a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39) with regard to that day as well. <b>Therefore, the verse can be speaking only of the intermediate Festival days, teaching you that the performance of labor is prohibited on them.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:4 | which you shall declare in their seasons” | Rosh Hashanah21b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the witnesses who saw the new moon <b>may desecrate Shabbat</b> in order to testify before the court? <b>The verse states: “These are the Festivals of the Lord,</b> sacred gatherings, <b>which you shall declare in their seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:4), thereby emphasizing that the Festivals must be set at their proper times. To ensure that they occur at the proper times, it is even permitted to desecrate Shabbat. |
| Leviticus 23:4 | which you shall declare in their seasons” | Rosh Hashanah22a:11 | <b>And if it was a long journey</b> to Jerusalem, <b>they may take sustenance with them,</b> although it is ordinarily prohibited to carry on Shabbat, <b>since for</b> a distance of <b>a walk of a night and a day,</b> the witnesses <b>may desecrate Shabbat and go out to</b> give <b>testimony</b> to determine the start of <b>the month.</b> This is <b>as it is stated: “These are the Festivals of the Lord,</b> sacred gatherings, <b>which you shall declare in their seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:4). This teaches that, in all cases, the Festivals must be fixed at their proper times, even if it entails the transgression of Torah prohibitions. |
| Leviticus 23:4 | them [ otam ] | Rosh Hashanah25a:13 | Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: My teacher, allow me to say before you one matter that you</b> yourself once <b>taught me. He said to him: Speak. He said to him: It states</b> with respect to the Festivals: “The appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations (Leviticus 23:2). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> in their season” (Leviticus 23:4). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:37). <b>Three times</b> the verses use the term: Them [<i>otam</i>], which can also be read as you [<i>atem</i>], in plural. |
| Leviticus 23:4 | As it is stated: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations, which you shall proclaim | Rosh Hashanah25a:4 | <b>Rabbi Akiva went and found</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>distressed</b> that the head of the Great Sanhedrin was forcing him to desecrate the day that he maintained was Yom Kippur. In an attempt to console him, Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>I can learn</b> from a verse <b>that everything that Rabban Gamliel did</b> in sanctifying the month <b>is done,</b> i.e., it is valid. <b>As it is stated: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations, which you shall proclaim</b> in their season” (Leviticus 23:4). This verse indicates that <b>whether</b> you have proclaimed them <b>at their</b> proper <b>time</b> or <b>whether</b> you have declared them <b>not at their</b> proper <b>time, I have only these Festivals</b> as established by the representatives of the Jewish people. |
| Leviticus 23:6 | festival of Passover” | Kiddushin 34b:1 | It is <b>necessary</b> to state this verse for another reason, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, where the verse states: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), <b>from</b> Passover, where the verse states: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the <b>festival of Passover”</b> (Leviticus 23:6). One would then say that <b>just as there women are obligated</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on the first night of Passover, despite the fact that it is a time-bound mitzva, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of residing in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>women are obligated.</b> Therefore it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to use the term “the homeborn” to exclude women from the obligation to reside in a <i>sukka</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:6 | fifteenth | Kiddushin 34b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the verses concerning <b><i>matza</i> and assembly</b> are <b>also necessary,</b> each for its own reason, and they are not two verses that come as one either. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>For what</b> purpose are both of them <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> that women are obligated in the mitzva of <b>assembly but had not written</b> that they are obligated in eating <b><i>matza</i>, I would say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to Passover, where the verse states: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the festival of Passover” (Leviticus 23:6), from <i>Sukkot</i>, where the verse states: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), teaching that women are exempt from eating <i>matza</i>, just as they are exempt from residing in a <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, it is necessary for a verse to teach that women are obligated in eating <i>matza</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:6 | fifteenth | Sukkah 27a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> There is a verbal analogy between the festivals of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:34). <b>And it is stated:</b> “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the festival of <i>matzot</i> unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:6) <b>with regard to</b> the festival of <b>Passover. Just as there,</b> with regard to Passover, on <b>the first night</b> there is <b>an obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>and from that point onward it is optional,</b> as from that point onward the only obligation is to refrain from eating leaven, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, on <b>the first night</b> there <b>is an obligation</b> to eat in the <i>sukka</i> <b>and from that point onward it is optional.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:6 | festival of matzot ” | Sukkah 28b:2 | <b>Rava said</b> a different reason: A <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>was necessary</b> to teach that a woman is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, about which it is written: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), <b>from</b> Passover, about which it is written: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the <b>festival of <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:6). <b>Just as there, women are obligated</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover even though it is a time-bound mitzva, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, <b>women are obligated.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>teaches us</b> that they are exempt. |
| Leviticus 23:7 | it is written: “On the first [ harishon ] day you shall have a sacred convocation; | Pesachim 5a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah <b>neither</b> the conjunction <b><i>vav</i> nor</b> the definite article <b><i>heh</i>.</b> Since they neutralize each other, as explained above, the same result could have been achieved by omitting both. <b>And furthermore, there,</b> in its description of Passover, <b>it is written: “On the first [<i>harishon</i>] day you shall have a sacred convocation;</b> you shall do no servile work” (Leviticus 23:7). Does <b>first mean previous,</b> the day preceding the Festival, in this case too? Labor is permitted on the eve of the Festival. |
| Leviticus 23:8 | and a prohibition: | Shabbat 25a:1 | The latter term is a positive <b>mitzva</b> to rest. <b>And,</b> if so, observance of <b>a Festival is</b> a mitzva that was commanded with both <b>a positive mitzva</b> to rest <b>and a prohibition:</b> “You shall do no manner of servile work” (Leviticus 23:8). <b>And</b> there is a principle that <b>a positive mitzva,</b> e.g., burning consecrated items whose time has expired, <b>does not override</b> a mitzva that was commanded with both <b>a prohibition and a positive mitzva,</b> e.g., observance of the Festival. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | “Then you shall bring the omer , the first of your harvest to the priest” | Menachot 60b:6 | <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> adds to the logical inference and <b>says</b> that other cases are included in the derivation from the verse, as the term <b>“and you shall bring”</b> serves <b>to include the <i>omer</i> meal offering in</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near</b> to the altar; <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the <i>omer</i> meal offering: <b>“Then you shall bring the <i>omer</i>, the first of your harvest to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10). Furthermore, <b>“and it shall be drawn near”</b> serves <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i></b> in the requirement <b>of bringing near; and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And draw it near to the altar”</b> (Numbers 5:25). |
| Leviticus 23:10 | “the first” | Menachot 70b:11 | § The mishna further teaches with regard to the five grains: <b>And</b> it is prohibited <b>to reap</b> them <b>prior to the <i>omer</i></b> offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“the first”</b> written in conjunction with the new crop: “You shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest” (Leviticus 23:10), <b>and “the first”</b> written <b>with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>:</b> “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift” (Numbers 15:20). Just as the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> applies only to bread prepared from the five grains, so too the prohibition against reaping the new crop prior to the <i>omer</i> offering applies only to crops of the five grains. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the omer ” | Menachot 71a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the ruling of the mishna that one may reap a crop that grows in an irrigated field in the valleys, the Gemara cites that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Binyamin says</b> that <b>one verse states:</b> “When you come into the land that I give to you <b>and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the <i>omer</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:10). This verse indicates that one may reap his grain before bringing the <i>omer</i> offering. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> in the continuation of the same verse: <b>“Of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest,”</b> from which it may be inferred that the <i>omer</i> is brought from the first reaped grain. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | your harvest | Menachot 72a:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And one may reap</b> crops prior to the <i>omer</i> <b>due to</b> potential damage to <b>saplings</b> growing alongside the crops; and <b>due to the place of mourning,</b> to create room for those consoling the mourners, who would bless them upon their return from the cemetery; and <b>due to</b> the need to create room for students to study, as failure to do so would lead to <b>dereliction of</b> Torah study in <b>the study hall.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> one is permitted to reap prior to the <i>omer</i> offering in these instances? The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “You shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of <b>your harvest</b> to the priest” (Leviticus 23:10). The use of the term “your harvest” indicates that the <i>omer</i> offering’s reaping must precede any personal harvest, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> need to precede <b>reaping for</b> the purpose of <b>a mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:10 | “first” written | Menachot 83b:18 | The Gemara questions the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves are valid even if brought from an old crop: <b>But isn’t</b> the term <b>“first” written</b> with regard to both the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves? This indicates they must come from the new crop. The <i>omer</i> is referred to as “the first of your harvest” (Leviticus 23:10), and the two loaves are referred to as “an offering of the first” (Leviticus 2:12). The Gemara answers: The term indicates that only the new crop should be used, but that is only <b>for</b> the proper fulfillment of the <b>mitzva.</b> If an old crop was used, the offerings are still valid. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | “When you come into the land | Menachot 84a:2 | <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that <b>the <i>omer</i></b> may <b>come from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse that introduces the obligation to bring the <i>omer</i>: <b>“When you come into the land</b> which I give to you” (Leviticus 23:10)? This verse appears to indicate that the bringing of the <i>omer</i> is restricted to Eretz Yisrael. That verse teaches <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>were not obligated in</b> the mitzva of bringing <b>the <i>omer</i> before they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | “When you come | Menachot 84a:3 | The Gemara explains the basis of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>And he holds</b> that even <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, consuming the <b>new</b> crop <b>is</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “From all your dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which <b>indicates</b> that the prohibition applies <b>anywhere that you dwell,</b> even outside of Eretz Yisrael. Accordingly, the earlier verse, which introduces the prohibition with: <b>“When you come</b> into the land which I give to you” (Leviticus 23:10), <b>is</b> a reference to <b>the time</b> of the Jewish people <b>entering</b> Eretz Yisrael, and it indicates that the prohibition takes effect only from that time. <b>And since</b> Rabbi Yosei holds that the new crop outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>is</b> prohibited for consumption <b>by Torah law,</b> he consequently holds that <b>one may also offer</b> the <i>omer</i> from crops grown there. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | “The first of your harvest” | Menachot 84a:9 | § An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> concerning the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>omer</i> may not be brought from the previous year’s crop: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> it is derived from: <b>“Fresh ear, you shall bring,”</b> as Rav Ḥisda explains. <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> it is derived from the fact that the <i>omer</i> is referred to as: <b>“The first of your harvest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10), which indicates that the <i>omer</i> is brought only from <b>the first of your harvest,</b> i.e., from the first produce of the current year’s crop, <b>and not from the last of your harvest,</b> i.e., from produce taken from the remainder of the previous year’s crop. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | Rav Shemaya said: It is different there, as the verse said: “Your harvest” | Pesachim 23a:8 | <b>Rav Shemaya said: It is different there, as the verse said: “Your harvest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10), indicating that <b>your harvest will be yours.</b> In other words, one may benefit from it, as it is still considered to be his. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> Sage, Ḥizkiya, derive from this phrase? The Gemara answers that according to his opinion, <b>“your harvest”</b> is referring to the harvest <b>of the entire Jewish people.</b> This is common biblical vernacular, and nothing may be derived from it. |
| Leviticus 23:10 | your harvest | Rosh Hashanah13a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya then said: What I said is nothing,</b> and my question had no basis, as it can be demonstrated that the Sages know how to determine that produce has reached one-third of its growth. <b>As Rav Kahana was</b> once <b>asked by the</b> other <b>colleagues</b> of the academy as follows: With regard to <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>that the Jewish people brought when they</b> first <b>entered Eretz Yisrael</b> in the days of Joshua, <b>from where did they bring it? If you say</b> that this <i>omer</i> offering was brought from grain <b>that grew in the possession of a gentile,</b> there is a difficulty, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “You shall bring an <i>omer</i> of the first fruits of <b>your harvest</b> to the priest” (Leviticus 23:10), from which it can be derived that it must be your harvest, grown in the possession of a Jew, <b>and not the harvest of a gentile.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:10 | then you shall bring the sheaf [ omer ], the first of your harvest to the priest” | Shabbat 131a:5 | With regard to this verbal analogy the Gemara comments: It must be that those terms are <b>free,</b> i.e., they are superfluous in their context and therefore available for the purpose of establishing a verbal analogy. <b>As, if they are not free,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be</b> logically <b>refuted,</b> as it is possible to say: <b>What</b> is unique <b>to the <i>omer</i>? That if one found reaped</b> barley <b>one must</b> nevertheless <b>reap</b> more barley for the sake of the mitzva. Can <b>you say</b> the same with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the two loaves,</b> where it is taught that <b>if one found reaped</b> grain <b>one need not reap</b> additional grain for the sacrifice? Apparently, the <i>halakhot</i> of the offering of the two loaves are not parallel to those of the <i>omer</i>. The same might be true with regard to actions that facilitate the performance of the mitzva. <b>In truth,</b> the verse <b>is free</b> for establishing the verbal analogy. The Gemara explains: <b>Since the verse</b> already <b>states:</b> “When you come to the land that I am giving to you, and you reap its harvest, <b>then you shall bring the sheaf [<i>omer</i>], the first of your harvest to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10), when the verse restates, “And you shall count for yourselves from the morrow after the day of rest, <b>from the day you have brought</b> the sheaf of the waving, seven whole weeks they shall be” (Leviticus 23:15), <b>why do I</b> need this repetition? <b>Conclude from this</b> that the additional statement is there <b>to</b> render the term “bringing” <b>free</b> for establishing a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 23:11 | bringing near and waving. | Menachot 61a:8 | <b>The <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>require</b> both <b>bringing near and waving.</b> The meal offering of the <i>omer</i> requires waving, as it is written: “And he shall wave the <i>omer</i> before the Lord” (Leviticus 23:11), and likewise with regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> it is written: “And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand and shall wave the meal offering before the Lord” (Numbers 5:25). The requirement of bringing near is derived as explained earlier. <b>The shewbread and the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations require neither bringing near nor waving.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:12 | as it is written: “And on the day you wave the omer ” | Megillah 20b:15 | <b>For placing hands</b> on the head of an offering <b>and for slaughtering</b> an offering, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And he shall lay</b> his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), comparing the laying of hands to slaughtering. <b>And it is written with regard to slaughtering: “On the day that you slaughter”</b> (Leviticus 19:6), meaning during the day and not at night. <b>And for waving</b> the offerings that require waving, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And on the day you wave the <i>omer</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:12). |
| Leviticus 23:13 | “And its meal offering shall be two tenths” | Menachot 89b:11 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the lamb</b> offering <b>that comes with the <i>omer</i></b> meal offering, the quantity of flour used in its meal offering is doubled, i.e., one uses twice the amount that is generally used for meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of a lamb, but the quantities of oil and wine are not doubled. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the <i>omer</i> meal offering: <b>“And its meal offering shall be two tenths”</b> (Leviticus 23:13). This verse <b>teaches about</b> the <b>lamb that comes with the <i>omer</i> that</b> the size of <b>its meal offering is doubled.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:13 | “And its libation shall be of wine, a quarter- hin ” | Menachot 89b:12 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as its meal offering is doubled, so</b> too <b>its wine</b> libation should be <b>doubled,</b> i.e., instead of using a quarter-<i>hin</i>, as is generally done for lambs, one should use a half-<i>hin</i>. To counter this, <b>the verse states,</b> in its continuation: <b>“And its libation shall be of wine, a quarter-<i>hin</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is only <b>its wine</b> libation that <b>should not be doubled, as it is not intermingled with</b> the flour of <b>its meal offering, but its oil should be doubled, as it is intermingled with</b> the flour of <b>its meal offering.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And its libation</b> shall be of wine, a quarter-<i>hin</i>,” which teaches that <b>all of its libations shall be only a quarter</b>-<b><i>hin</i></b>, but no more. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | the new crop is immediately permitted. | Eruvin 32a:2 | <b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say this? As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Once the <i>omer</i> has been offered,</b> the grain from <b>the new crop is immediately permitted.</b> The Torah prohibits eating from the new crop of grain until the <i>omer</i> sacrifice is offered on the second day of Passover (Leviticus 23:14); once the <i>omer</i> is offered, it is immediately permitted to partake of the new grain. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | three | Keritot 5a:3 | § <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One who eats bread, parched grain, and fresh stalks</b> before the <i>omer</i> offering has been sacrificed <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes, as it states: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh stalks until this day itself, until you have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:14). The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But one is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>a general prohibition.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here, as the verses are superfluous;</b> the verse did not need to specify these three types of grain products. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | What is the reason | Kiddushin 37a:9 | <b>What is the reason</b> of the first <i>tanna</i>? In the verse that states with regard to the new crop: “In all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:14), the term <b>dwelling</b> does not mean that this <i>halakha</i> applies wherever Jews live. Rather, it means that the mitzva is applicable only in Eretz Yisrael, as this phrase <b>indicates</b> a time <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael by the Jewish people, when they are actually dwelling in the land, not when they are in the process of conquering it. This is the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | until this selfsame day, | Menachot 68a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: But isn’t it forbidden by Torah law, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, <b>until this selfsame day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14)? This means that the new crop is prohibited on the day of the waving unless permitted by sacrifice of the offering. <b>And</b> if so, <b>for what</b> reason is it <b>permitted</b> for those <b>distant</b> to eat the new crop <b>from midday and beyond,</b> when the Temple is standing? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they know that the</b> members of the <b>court are not indolent in its</b> sacrifice, and certainly by midday the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering has been completed. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | What is the reason? Two verses are written | Menachot 68a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Two verses are written</b> with regard to the new crop. More precisely, there are two clauses in the same verse: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, until this selfsame day, until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14). <b>It is written</b> that the new crop is prohibited <b>“until you have brought</b> the offering,” <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> that the new crop is prohibited only <b>“until the selfsame day.” How so?</b> How can these clauses be reconciled? |
| Leviticus 23:14 | until this selfsame [ etzem ] day, | Menachot 68b:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai stated</b> his ordinance <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>it is prohibited by Torah law</b> to eat of the new grain until the seventeenth of Nisan, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall eat neither bread nor parched grain, nor fresh stalks, <b>until this selfsame [<i>etzem</i>] day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14). |
| Leviticus 23:14 | throughout your generations” | Menachot 84a:6 | Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: The Merciful One said to you</b> about the <i>omer</i>: “It is a statute forever <b>throughout your generations”</b> (Leviticus 23:14), indicating that the mitzva can be fulfilled in all times, <b>and you say</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>should be canceled</b> in a Sabbatical Year? |
| Leviticus 23:14 | new | Nedarim 58a:1 | For <b>any item that can become permitted,</b> i.e., a forbidden object whose prohibition can or will lapse, <b>for example, untithed produce</b> that can be permitted through tithing, <b>and second tithe</b> that is permitted through redemption or bringing it to Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 14:24–26), <b>and consecrated items</b> that are also permitted through redemption, <b>and</b> produce of the <b>new</b> crop that is permitted after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering (Leviticus 23:14), <b>the Sages did not determine a measure for their</b> neutralization, and no mixture with any quantity of permitted items neutralizes their prohibition. <b>And</b> for <b>any item that cannot become permitted, for example, <i>teruma</i>, and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, and <i>ḥalla</i></b> (Numbers 15:20–21); <b>fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>]; and forbidden food crops in a vineyard</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9), <b>the Sages determined a measure for their</b> neutralization. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | as the Merciful One says: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh stalks until this day itself, | Pesachim 23a:7 | The Gemara continues to challenge Rabbi Abbahu’s opinion: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition of <b>new</b> grain, which was harvested before the bringing of the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>as the Merciful One says: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh stalks until this day itself,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:14). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>harvest</b> grain before the <i>omer</i> <b>as fodder and feed it to his animal.</b> Apparently, one may derive benefit from this grain even though the verse says: “You shall not eat.” |
| Leviticus 23:14 | until this selfsame [ etzem ] day, | Rosh Hashanah30b:1 | <b>stated</b> his decree <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> When the verse states: “And you shall eat neither bread nor parched corn, nor fresh stalks, <b>until this selfsame [<i>etzem</i>] day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14), this does not teach that it is permitted to eat the new grain on the morning of the sixteenth when the eastern horizon is illuminated. Rather, it is prohibited <b>until the essence [<i>atzmo</i>] of the day. And he holds</b> that when the verse says: <b>Until</b> that day, it means <b>until and including</b> this date. If so, by Torah law, eating the new grain is permitted only after the conclusion of the sixteenth, unless the <i>omer</i> offering was sacrificed, in which case it is permitted to eat the new grain immediately afterward. |
| Leviticus 23:14 | karmel | Shabbat 105a:4 | <b>The school of Rabbi Natan said</b> that there is another abbreviation in the Torah. In the verse: “And the angel of the Lord said to him: Why did you hit your donkey these three times? Behold I have come out as an adversary <b>because your way is contrary [<i>yarat</i>] against me”</b> (Numbers 22:32). <i>Yarat</i> is an abbreviation for: The donkey <b>feared [<i>yare’a</i>], it saw [<i>ra’ata</i>],</b> and <b>it turned aside [<i>nateta</i>]. The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The word <b><i>karmel</i></b> in the verse: “And bread, and toasted grain flour, and toasted grain [<i>karmel</i>]” (Leviticus 23:14) means: <b>A full kernel [<i>kar maleh</i>],</b> i.e., the seed fills the stalk. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> in King David’s words: “And behold, with you is Shimi ben Gera from Benjamin, of Bahurim, <b>who cursed me with a grievous [<i>nimretzet</i>] curse</b> on the day that I went to Mahanaim” (I Kings 2:8). The word <i>nimretzet</i> is an <b>abbreviation</b> for: <b>He is an adulterer [<i>noef</i>], he is a Moabite [<i>Moavi</i>], he is a murderer [<i>rotze’aḥ</i>], he is an oppressor [<i>tzorer</i>], he is an abomination [<i>to’eva</i>].</b> |
| Leviticus 23:14 | until this selfsame [ etzem ] day, | Sukkah 41b:1 | “And you shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain, <b>until this selfsame [<i>etzem</i>] day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14), indicating <b>until the essence [<i>itzumo</i>] of the day,</b> and not the night before. <b>And he holds that</b> when the verse states: <b>“Until,”</b> the word <b>until is inclusive,</b> meaning that the grain is permitted only after the conclusion of the sixteenth. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | so too, Shavuot | Chagigah 17b:7 | The Gemara suggests further: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another source, <b>as Rabba bar Shmuel taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Torah said</b> to <b>count</b> thirty <b>days, as it is stated:</b> “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the <b>month</b> with offerings. And the Torah also said to <b>count days</b> from Passover <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify the festival of <i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings, <b>as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (</b>Leviticus 23:16<b>).</b> From this comparison, we learn the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>Just as</b> the new <b>month is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one day, <b>so too, <i>Shavuot</i></b> is sanctified for the unit of time by which it is counted, i.e., for one full week, as it is stated: “Seven complete weeks shall there be” (Leviticus 23:15). The Gemara infers from this: <b>Does</b> this <b>not</b> mean that <b>we learn from</b> the <b>month?</b> If so, we can also learn that <b>just as</b> the festival of <b>a month,</b> the New Moon, is <b>one day, so too <i>Shavuot</i></b> is only <b>one day,</b> without days of redress. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | after Shabbat, | Menachot 65a:11 | The Gemara discusses the next period listed in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the eighth of</b> Nisan <b>until the end of the festival</b> of Passover, the correct date for the <b>festival of <i>Shavuot</i> was restored,</b> and it was similarly decreed <b>not to eulogize</b> during this period. <b>As the Boethusians would say</b> that the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> always occurs <b>after Shabbat,</b> on a Sunday. Their reasoning was that the verse states, with regard to the <i>omer</i> offering and the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> that follows seven weeks later: “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>], from the day that you brought the sheaf [<i>omer</i>] of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete” (Leviticus 23:15). Disregarding the oral tradition, the Boethusians interpreted the phrase “from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]” literally, as referring to Shabbat, not the Festival day. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | The Sages taught | Menachot 65b:10 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>], from the day that you brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks there shall be complete” (Leviticus 23:15). The phrase: <b>“And you shall count for you,”</b> teaches <b>that</b> the mitzva of counting is not a communal obligation. Rather, <b>there should be a counting by each and every</b> person. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | stated “ shabbat ” above | Menachot 65b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says</b> there is yet another refutation. It is <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” above</b> (Leviticus 23:15), with regard to starting the counting of the <i>omer</i>, <b>and</b> it is also <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” below</b> (Leviticus 23:16), with regard to the commencement of the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Just as</b> there, with regard to the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is stated: “Even until the morrow after the seventh week [<i>hashabbat</i>] you shall number fifty days,” <b>and</b> the word <i>shabbat</i> is referring to the <b>beginning of the Festival</b> and it immediately <b>follows</b> the end of the seventh week; <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the bringing of the <i>omer</i>, the word <i>shabbat</i> means <b>Festival,</b> so that the <i>omer</i> offering immediately <b>follows the beginning of the Festival,</b> on the second day of Passover. According to the Boethusians, the commencement of the counting could start well after the beginning of Passover. For example, if Passover occurs on a Sunday, the counting of the <i>omer</i> would start only the following Sunday. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | from the morrow after the day of rest [ hashabbat ]” | Menachot 66a:2 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the verse: “And you shall count for you <b>from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:15), means <b>from the morrow after the festival</b> of Passover. <b>Do you say</b> it means <b>from the morrow after the festival</b> of Passover, <b>or is it only</b> referring to <b>from the morrow after Shabbat of Creation,</b> i.e., Sunday? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> in response: <b>Is it stated: From the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>] that is during Passover? No, it is stated only: “From the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>].”</b> Considering <b>that the entire year is full of <i>Shabbatot</i>, go and</b> try to <b>examine</b> to <b>which Shabbat</b> the verse is referring. How does one know which Shabbat this means? Clearly, then, this “day of rest” is the Festival, not Shabbat. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | stated “ shabbat ” above | Menachot 66a:3 | Rabbi Yosei cites another proof: <b>And furthermore,</b> it is <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” below,</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> it is also <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” above</b> (Leviticus 23:15), with regard to starting the counting of the <i>omer</i>. <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is stated: “Even until the morrow after the seventh week [<i>shabbat</i>] you shall number fifty days,” <b>and</b> the word <i>shabbat</i> is referring to a time at the <b>beginning of the Festival; so too here,</b> with regard to the bringing of <i>omer</i>, the word <i>shabbat</i> means <b>Festival,</b> and the counting starts <b>near the beginning of the Festival,</b> on the second day of Passover. According to the Boethusians, sometimes the commencement of the counting is well after the start of Passover. |
| Leviticus 23:15 | by which it is counted, | Rosh Hashanah5a:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> that <b>which Rabba bar Shmuel taught, as Rabba bar Shmuel taught: The Torah states to count</b> the <b>days,</b> as it is stated: “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> a new <b>month</b> with offerings. <b>And</b> the Torah also said to <b>count</b> the <b>days</b> from Passover, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings. <b>Just as the</b> new <b>month is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one day, <b>so too, <i>Shavuot</i> is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one full week, as it is stated: “Seven complete weeks shall there be” (Leviticus 23:15). |
| Leviticus 23:15 | from the day you have brought | Shabbat 131a:5 | With regard to this verbal analogy the Gemara comments: It must be that those terms are <b>free,</b> i.e., they are superfluous in their context and therefore available for the purpose of establishing a verbal analogy. <b>As, if they are not free,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be</b> logically <b>refuted,</b> as it is possible to say: <b>What</b> is unique <b>to the <i>omer</i>? That if one found reaped</b> barley <b>one must</b> nevertheless <b>reap</b> more barley for the sake of the mitzva. Can <b>you say</b> the same with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the two loaves,</b> where it is taught that <b>if one found reaped</b> grain <b>one need not reap</b> additional grain for the sacrifice? Apparently, the <i>halakhot</i> of the offering of the two loaves are not parallel to those of the <i>omer</i>. The same might be true with regard to actions that facilitate the performance of the mitzva. <b>In truth,</b> the verse <b>is free</b> for establishing the verbal analogy. The Gemara explains: <b>Since the verse</b> already <b>states:</b> “When you come to the land that I am giving to you, and you reap its harvest, <b>then you shall bring the sheaf [<i>omer</i>], the first of your harvest to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10), when the verse restates, “And you shall count for yourselves from the morrow after the day of rest, <b>from the day you have brought</b> the sheaf of the waving, seven whole weeks they shall be” (Leviticus 23:15), <b>why do I</b> need this repetition? <b>Conclude from this</b> that the additional statement is there <b>to</b> render the term “bringing” <b>free</b> for establishing a verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | you shall count fifty days” | Chagigah 17b:8 | <b>Rava said: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Is that to say</b> that for <b><i>Shavuot</i> we count days</b> but <b>we do not count weeks? Didn’t Abaye say:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to count days,</b> in the counting of the <i>omer</i>, <b>as it is written:</b> “Until the morrow of the seventh week, <b>you shall count fifty days”</b> (Leviticus 23:16); <b>and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count weeks, as it is written: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself,</b> from when the sickle is first put to the standing corn” (Deuteronomy 16:9); <b>and further, it is written: “The festival of weeks [<i>shavuot</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10), which indicates that it is a Festival that is established through a count of weeks? Consequently, the days of redress for <i>Shavuot</i> should last a week, in accordance with its components. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | you shall number fifty days” | Menachot 65b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>],</b> this means <b>from the morrow after the festival</b> of Passover. <b>Or</b> perhaps this is <b>not</b> the meaning of the verse, but <b>rather</b> it means <b>after the Shabbat of Creation,</b> i.e., Sunday. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says:</b> This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Even until the morrow after the seventh week <b>you shall number fifty days”</b> (Leviticus 23:16). This teaches that <b>all the countings that you count shall be only fifty days.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:16 | you shall number fifty days; | Menachot 65b:2 | Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai cites a proof that <i>Shavuot</i> does not need to occur specifically on a Sunday. <b>One verse states:</b> “Even to the morrow after the seventh week <b>you shall number fifty days;</b> and you shall present a new meal offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and one verse,</b> the preceding one, apparently contradicts this when it <b>states:</b> “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the waving; <b>seven weeks shall there be complete.”</b> Is the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> seven full weeks after Passover, i.e., counting from Sunday through Shabbat seven times; or is it fifty days after Passover? |
| Leviticus 23:16 | “The morrow after the day of rest [ hashabbat ]” | Menachot 65b:5 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The previous proof <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Seven weeks <b>you shall number for you;</b> from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). The term “for you” indicates that the <b>counting</b> of the weeks <b>is dependent upon</b> the decision of the <b>court, as they know</b> how to <b>calculate the new</b> months, upon which the date of the Festival depends. Therefore, when the verse states: <b>“The morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:16), it means: <b>The morrow after the Festival,</b> as the determination of Festivals is by the court. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the interpretation that the counting starts after the <b>Shabbat of Creation,</b> i.e., a regular weekly Shabbat, <b>whose counting</b> can be performed <b>by every person,</b> not exclusively by the court. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | sanctify the festival of Shavuot | Menachot 65b:6 | Citing a different proof, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The <b>Torah said</b> to <b>count days,</b> as it is stated: “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the <b>month</b> with offerings. And the Torah also said to <b>count days</b> from Passover <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify the festival of <i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16). From this comparison, one can learn that <b>just as</b> the start of the counting toward the new <b>month is known</b> even <b>before it comes,</b> as one begins counting toward the following new month on the first day of a month, <b>so too</b> the start of the counting toward <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> is known</b> even <b>before it comes,</b> as one begins counting toward <i>Shavuot</i> on a fixed day of the month. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | stated “ shabbat ” below | Menachot 65b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says</b> there is yet another refutation. It is <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” above</b> (Leviticus 23:15), with regard to starting the counting of the <i>omer</i>, <b>and</b> it is also <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” below</b> (Leviticus 23:16), with regard to the commencement of the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Just as</b> there, with regard to the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is stated: “Even until the morrow after the seventh week [<i>hashabbat</i>] you shall number fifty days,” <b>and</b> the word <i>shabbat</i> is referring to the <b>beginning of the Festival</b> and it immediately <b>follows</b> the end of the seventh week; <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the bringing of the <i>omer</i>, the word <i>shabbat</i> means <b>Festival,</b> so that the <i>omer</i> offering immediately <b>follows the beginning of the Festival,</b> on the second day of Passover. According to the Boethusians, the commencement of the counting could start well after the beginning of Passover. For example, if Passover occurs on a Sunday, the counting of the <i>omer</i> would start only the following Sunday. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | stated “ shabbat ” below, | Menachot 66a:3 | Rabbi Yosei cites another proof: <b>And furthermore,</b> it is <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” below,</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> it is also <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” above</b> (Leviticus 23:15), with regard to starting the counting of the <i>omer</i>. <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is stated: “Even until the morrow after the seventh week [<i>shabbat</i>] you shall number fifty days,” <b>and</b> the word <i>shabbat</i> is referring to a time at the <b>beginning of the Festival; so too here,</b> with regard to the bringing of <i>omer</i>, the word <i>shabbat</i> means <b>Festival,</b> and the counting starts <b>near the beginning of the Festival,</b> on the second day of Passover. According to the Boethusians, sometimes the commencement of the counting is well after the start of Passover. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | “A new | Menachot 83b:19 | The Gemara asks: But <b>isn’t it written</b> with regard to the two loaves: <b>“A new</b> meal offering” (Leviticus 23:16), which indicates that only the new crop can be used? The fact that with regard to the two loaves the Torah repeats this requirement twice suggests that it is indispensable. The Gemara answers: The word “new” cannot teach that the use of the new crop is essential, as <b>it is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Akiva said</b> that even if <b>the two loaves are brought from the old</b> crop, they are <b>valid. How do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“A new</b> meal offering”? This teaches that the two loaves <b>are to be the first of all the</b> other <b>meal offerings.</b> No other meal offerings may be brought from the new crop until the meal offering of the two loaves has been brought. |
| Leviticus 23:16 | days | Rosh Hashanah5a:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> that <b>which Rabba bar Shmuel taught, as Rabba bar Shmuel taught: The Torah states to count</b> the <b>days,</b> as it is stated: “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> a new <b>month</b> with offerings. <b>And</b> the Torah also said to <b>count</b> the <b>days</b> from Passover, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings. <b>Just as the</b> new <b>month is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one day, <b>so too, <i>Shavuot</i> is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one full week, as it is stated: “Seven complete weeks shall there be” (Leviticus 23:15). |
| Leviticus 23:16 | the verse to state: “You shall bring,” | Zevachim 57b:3 | <b>Since</b> apparently there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “You shall bring,”</b> as it already states: “And you shall present a new meal offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state: “You shall bring”?</b> It states this to teach that <b>anything that you bring from another place</b> that is similar to this offering, i.e., the leavened bread that accompanies a thanks offering, <b>shall be</b> prepared <b>like this. Just as there,</b> with regard to the two loaves, they must be prepared from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>for</b> each <b>loaf, so too here,</b> each of the ten loaves of leavened bread that accompany a thanks offering must be prepared from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>for</b> each <b>loaf.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:17 | two loaves | Menachot 27a:16 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two sheep</b> brought together with the meal offering of the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of the sheep <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse: “They shall be holy” (Leviticus 23:20), since the employment of a term of <b>being</b> indicates an indispensable requirement. Similarly, with regard to the <b>two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, the reason failure to bring each of the loaves prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse states: “They shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17), employing a term of <b>being.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:17 | they shall be [ tihyena ] | Menachot 45b:15 | The Gemara answers: <b>He derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> based upon a verbal analogy between two verses. One verse states: “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs; <b>they shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20). The term “they shall be” indicates that it is essential that the offering be brought precisely as commanded, but it is unclear whether this is referring to the loaves or to the sheep brought as peace offerings. This is clarified by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving of two tenth parts of an ephah; <b>they shall be [<i>tihyena</i>]</b> of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17). |
| Leviticus 23:17 | for first fruits to the Lord” | Menachot 46b:26 | <b>And Rava said</b> by way of explanation: <b>From where do I state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? From the fact <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring out of your dwellings</b> two <b>loaves of waving</b> of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, <b>for first fruits to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>Just as first fruits</b> are brought <b>by themselves,</b> without an accompanying animal offering, <b>so too the two loaves</b> are brought <b>by themselves</b> when there are no sheep available. <b>And</b> learn <b>from this</b> comparison to first fruits that <b>just as first fruits</b> are brought <b>to be eaten, so too the two loaves</b> are <b>also</b> brought <b>to be eaten,</b> even in the absence of the sheep brought as peace offerings. |
| Leviticus 23:17 | As it is written: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts of a ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven, for first produce to the Lord” | Menachot 57b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all.</b> Rabbi Yonatan cites a proof for his opinion: <b>You can know</b> that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated at all, <b>because</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them. <b>As it is written: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts of a ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven, for first produce to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>When</b> are <b>they</b> considered consecrated <b>to the Lord?</b> Only <b>after they are baked</b> with leaven. This demonstrates that when the flour is placed into the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel the meal offering is not yet consecrated. |
| Leviticus 23:17 | “You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving” | Menachot 77b:12 | Since both of these comparisons are equally plausible, <b>the verse states</b> concerning the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “You shall bring,” what,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “You shall bring”?</b> This indicates <b>that whatever,</b> i.e., any meal offering, <b>you bring from a different place,</b> it must <b>be like this,</b> i.e., the two loaves. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the two loaves, the measure is <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf, so too here,</b> in the case of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, the measure is <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:17 | “Bread” | Menachot 77b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We have learned with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>that its</b> measure is <b>one</b> out <b>of</b> every <b>ten. But I do not know</b> from this verbal analogy <b>from how much</b> flour each leavened <b>loaf</b> is to be prepared. <b>I</b> therefore <b>derive</b> this from a verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> in the passage concerning the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“Bread”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there, with regard to the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat: <b>“Bread”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the two loaves, one prepares the loaves with <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf, so too here,</b> with regard to the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, one prepares the loaves with <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:17 | “You shall bring” | Menachot 78a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that a <i>halakha</i> derived from itself and from another matter <b>does not constitute a comparison, but according to the one who says</b> that a <i>halakha</i> derived from itself and from another matter <b>does constitute a comparison, what is there to say?</b> The Gemara responds: According to that opinion, the <i>halakha</i> that each loaf is prepared from a tenth of an ephah is derived from that which the verse states with regard to the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which <b>is</b> a term of <b>amplification</b> that serves to teach that the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering consist of ten tenths of an ephah of flour. Since this <i>halakha</i> is derived not by comparison but by amplification from the two loaves, one can derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <i>matza</i> loaves by comparison to the loaves of leavened bread. |
| Leviticus 23:17 | you shall bring” | Menachot 83b:16 | The Gemara asks how two <i>halakhot</i> can be derived from the same term: <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>expound that</b> term to teach that one can use grain only if it is grown in Eretz Yisrael? How can you also derive from it that the grain can be brought from an old crop? The Gemara explains: That is derived from the next term, as <b>the verse states:</b> “From your dwellings <b>you shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which teaches that one may bring them from any grain grown in Eretz Yisrael <b>and even from</b> an old crop that was stored away in <b>the attic.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:17 | by Torah law, as it is written: “From all your dwellings” | Menachot 84a:3 | The Gemara explains the basis of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>And he holds</b> that even <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, consuming the <b>new</b> crop <b>is</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “From all your dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which <b>indicates</b> that the prohibition applies <b>anywhere that you dwell,</b> even outside of Eretz Yisrael. Accordingly, the earlier verse, which introduces the prohibition with: <b>“When you come</b> into the land which I give to you” (Leviticus 23:10), <b>is</b> a reference to <b>the time</b> of the Jewish people <b>entering</b> Eretz Yisrael, and it indicates that the prohibition takes effect only from that time. <b>And since</b> Rabbi Yosei holds that the new crop outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>is</b> prohibited for consumption <b>by Torah law,</b> he consequently holds that <b>one may also offer</b> the <i>omer</i> from crops grown there. |
| Leviticus 23:17 | refute | Shabbat 131a:6 | <b>And</b> yet there is <b>still</b> a difficulty: The verbal analogy <b>is free</b> only <b>from one side,</b> as only the verse that mentions bringing in the context of the <i>omer</i> offering is superfluous in its context, <b>and we heard Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> with regard to a verbal analogy that it is only <b>free from one side,</b> that <b>one</b> can <b>derive</b> from it, <b>and one</b> can also <b>refute</b> it logically. The Gemara answers: There is a superfluous usage of the term with regard to the two loaves as well, as in the verse: “From your dwelling places you shall bring the loaves of waving of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven for first-fruits unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:17) the phrase: <b>“You shall bring” is an amplification.</b> Since it was mentioned in the previous verse it is superfluous in its context. Consequently, the verbal analogy is available from both sides. |
| Leviticus 23:17 | “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave loaves | Zevachim 57b:2 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that a matter derived via a juxtaposition and another principle <b>is not a juxtaposition, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the offering brought on <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>“You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave loaves</b> of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17). |
| Leviticus 23:18 | being is written about them | Menachot 45a:1 | The Gemara asks: The mishna mentioned <b>rams,</b> in plural; <b>on which</b> festival are multiple rams offered? <b>If</b> the mishna is referring to the additional offerings sacrificed <b>on those</b> days of the new moon and <i>Shavuot</i> as prescribed in the book of Numbers, these offerings include only one <b>ram</b> and not two. And <b>if</b> it is referring to the two rams <b>of <i>Shavuot</i></b> that accompany the two loaves, as prescribed <b>in Leviticus,</b> a term of <b>being is written about them</b> in the verse: “They shall be a burnt offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:18). This term indicates that the offerings must be sacrificed exactly as prescribed in order to be valid. Consequently, one may not sacrifice fewer than two rams. |
| Leviticus 23:18 | “They shall be [ yihyu ] | Menachot 45b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how did Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas,</b> who holds that failure to sacrifice the sheep prevents the bringing of the loaves but failure to bring the loaves does not prevent sacrifice of the sheep, derive his ruling? <b>He derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> through a verbal analogy between the verse: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> holy to the Lord for the priest,” and the verse that states, concerning the seven sheep brought as burnt offerings: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> a burnt offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:18). <b>Just as there</b> the requirement that it be done as prescribed is referring to the <b>sheep, so too here</b> it is referring to <b>sheep</b> rather than loaves. |
| Leviticus 23:18 | The Sages taught: | Menachot 45b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches the <i>halakhot</i> of the sacrifices that generally accompany the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i> in a case when the two loaves are not available. The Gemara cites a relevant <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse that mandates these offerings states: “And you shall sacrifice with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bull, and two rams” (Leviticus 23:18). The phrase <b>“and you shall sacrifice with the bread”</b> indicates that it is <b>obligatory</b> to sacrifice these burnt offerings <b>with the loaves</b> of bread, and if the loaves are not available, then these offerings are not sacrificed. The continuation of the verse: <b>“Seven lambs without blemish,”</b> teaches that the lambs are sacrificed <b>even if there are no loaves</b> available. |
| Leviticus 23:19 | “And you shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, | Zevachim 55a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the communal peace offerings, i.e., the two sheep brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>require</b> slaughter in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan taught before Rava:</b> The passage in the Torah discussing the offerings of <i>Shavuot</i> states: <b>“And you shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering,</b> and two male sheep in their first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 23:19). The peace offerings are juxtaposed with the sin offering. <b>Just as</b> the <b>sin offering</b> must be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>so too, communal peace offerings</b> must be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. |
| Leviticus 23:20 | Shavuot . Just as there, | Arakhin 25b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the source for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the priests are not required to give the redemption payment to the Temple treasury? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the word <b>“holy”</b> used with regard to an ancestral field, and the word <b>“holy”</b> used with regard to the communal peace offering of two <b>lambs</b> that accompanies the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>. Just as there,</b> with regard to the offering of two lambs, where the verse states: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20), the lambs are given to the priests <b>for free,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings to which members of the priesthood are entitled, <b>so too here,</b> the consecrated and unredeemed ancestral field is given to the priests <b>for free.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:20 | prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other. | Menachot 27a:16 | The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two sheep</b> brought together with the meal offering of the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of the sheep <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse: “They shall be holy” (Leviticus 23:20), since the employment of a term of <b>being</b> indicates an indispensable requirement. Similarly, with regard to the <b>two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, the reason failure to bring each of the loaves prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse states: “They shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17), employing a term of <b>being.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:20 | they shall be [ yihyu ] | Menachot 45b:15 | The Gemara answers: <b>He derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> based upon a verbal analogy between two verses. One verse states: “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs; <b>they shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20). The term “they shall be” indicates that it is essential that the offering be brought precisely as commanded, but it is unclear whether this is referring to the loaves or to the sheep brought as peace offerings. This is clarified by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving of two tenth parts of an ephah; <b>they shall be [<i>tihyena</i>]</b> of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17). |
| Leviticus 23:20 | verse itself: “They shall be [ yihyu ] holy to the Lord for the priest” | Menachot 45b:22 | The Gemara presents an alternative explanation for the basis of their divergent opinions: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that they <b>disagree about the</b> interpretation of the <b>verse itself: “They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>] holy to the Lord for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:20). <b>Rabbi Akiva holds: Which item is entirely</b> given <b>to the priest? You must say</b> that <b>it is</b> the loaves of <b>bread.</b> Therefore he concludes that the word <i>yihyu</i> is referring to the loaves of bread, and if they are not sacrificed, the two sheep cannot be sacrificed as peace offerings. |
| Leviticus 23:20 | Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥanina said to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: But when it is written: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest” | Menachot 46a:5 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥanina said to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: But when it is written: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:20), it is <b>written</b> immediately <b>after</b> the verse mentions <b>waving, and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree,</b> based on this phrase, about whether the loaves can be brought without the sheep or the sheep can be sacrificed without the loaves. This indicates that the waving does not establish a bond between these two items. |
| Leviticus 23:20 | before the Lord, | Menachot 48a:3 | The process of redemption would be to place all four loaves in front of him and state that whichever two of the loaves do not have inherent sanctity are redeemed for money. <b>If he redeems them outside</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>since it is written:</b> “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering <b>before the Lord,</b> with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20), <b>he disqualifies</b> the two loaves that possess inherent sanctity <b>by</b> causing them to <b>leave</b> the courtyard, at which point they are no longer “before the Lord.” Conversely, <b>if</b> he redeems them <b>inside</b> the courtyard, once the two loaves that do not possess inherent sanctity are redeemed, he violates the prohibition against <b>bringing non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:20 | Shavuot | Menachot 61a:6 | This requirement applies to peace offerings belonging <b>both</b> to <b>men and</b> to <b>women, by</b> male <b>Jews and not by others.</b> The Gemara will explain this seemingly contradictory statement on 61b. In addition, <b>the two loaves and</b> the accompanying peace offering of <b>two lambs</b> brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> also do not require bringing near but do require waving, as it is written: “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20). |
| Leviticus 23:20 | “And the priest shall wave them upon the bread of the first fruits | Menachot 62a:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And the two loaves and</b> the accompanying peace offering of <b>two lambs</b> brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> also require waving. With regard to this waving, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall wave them upon the bread of the first fruits</b> for a wave offering before the Lord, upon the two lambs; they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20). |
| Leviticus 23:20 | them | Menachot 62b:6 | The Gemara answers: This <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not accepted, because <b>the Merciful One excluded</b> peace offerings brought by an individual, as the verse states <b>with regard to communal peace offerings:</b> “And the priest shall wave <b>them</b> with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20). The word <b>“them”</b> serves <b>to exclude peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual</b> from the requirement of waving while the animal is alive. |
| Leviticus 23:21 | “And you shall make a proclamation | Chagigah 17b:9 | § In <b>the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> a Sage <b>taught</b> the following: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>“And you shall make a proclamation</b> on this very day, it shall be a holy convocation, you shall do no kind of laborious work” (Leviticus 23:21), and it states in the same chapter: <b>“And when you reap</b> the harvest of your land” (Leviticus 23:22). <b>Which is the Festival on which you make a proclamation and</b> also <b>reap,</b> i.e., which Festival occurs in the harvest season? <b>You must say it is the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:22 | ownerless | Bava Kamma69a:14 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In the <b>morning the homeowner,</b> i.e., the owner of a field, <b>stands and says: Anything that the poor will pick today</b> that is not rightfully theirs <b>shall</b> hereby <b>be</b> considered <b>ownerless</b> property. The poor are entitled to glean leftover grain from a field after it is harvested (Leviticus 23:22). Yet there are many <i>halakhot</i> involved in determining what produce they are entitled to take, and not all poor people are learned enough to know these <i>halakhot</i>. Consequently, there will inevitably be poor people who will take a certain amount of grain to which they are not entitled. For this reason, the owner of the field should relinquish, in advance, ownership over whatever the poor might unlawfully take. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | “And when you reap | Chagigah 17b:9 | § In <b>the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> a Sage <b>taught</b> the following: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>“And you shall make a proclamation</b> on this very day, it shall be a holy convocation, you shall do no kind of laborious work” (Leviticus 23:21), and it states in the same chapter: <b>“And when you reap</b> the harvest of your land” (Leviticus 23:22). <b>Which is the Festival on which you make a proclamation and</b> also <b>reap,</b> i.e., which Festival occurs in the harvest season? <b>You must say it is the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:22 | the gleaning of your harvest; | Chullin 131b:1 | <b>and the forgotten</b> sheaves, <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>. As it is written: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of [<i>pe’at</i>] your field,</b> neither shall you gather <b>the gleaning of your harvest;</b> you shall leave them for the poor, and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). And it is also written: <b>“When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field,</b> you shall not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:19). |
| Leviticus 23:22 | leaving is written with regard to them, | Chullin 131b:3 | The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the gifts left to the poor, <b>the owner</b> of the produce <b>does not have the benefit of discretion,</b> i.e., the right to distribute the gifts to poor people of his choosing. Instead, any poor person who takes possession of these gifts becomes their rightful owner. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is because the requirement of <b>leaving is written with regard to them,</b> e.g., in the verse that states: “You shall leave them” (Leviticus 23:22). |
| Leviticus 23:22 | as it is written: “Neither the gleaning of your harvest shall you gather; for the poor you shall leave them, and for the stranger” | Chullin 131b:4 | The <i>baraita</i> also stated: <b>And even a poor person of Israel</b> who owns a vineyard, field, or tree must leave these gifts for all poor people, and if he does not, <b>the court removes</b> them <b>from his possession.</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Neither the gleaning of your harvest shall you gather; for the poor you shall leave them, and for the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 23:22). Since the verse juxtaposes the words “the poor” to the mitzva in the previous clause, this serves <b>to warn a poor person</b> that he must also separate these gifts from <b>his own</b> produce. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | “You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” | Chullin 134b:3 | § With regard to gifts left for the poor, the Gemara relates that <b>Levi sowed</b> crops in his field <b>in Kishar, but there were no poor</b> people in Kishar <b>to take gleanings</b> from his field. Levi <b>came before Rav Sheshet</b> to ask what should be done with the gleanings. Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> The verse states with regard to the mitzvot of <i>pe’a</i> and gleanings: <b>“You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), <b>and not for the ravens nor for the bats.</b> Since there are no poor people to take the gleanings, you should take them for yourself. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | leaving | Chullin 134b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state <b>an extra</b> term of <b>leaving</b> with regard to gleanings? One verse states: “Neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest, and your vineyard you shall not harvest completely, and the fallen fruit of your vineyard you shall not gather; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:9–10), and another verse states: “Neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). Doesn’t this additional mention of leaving indicate that even if there are no poor people to take the gleanings, the owner must collect them and ensure that a poor person can claim them? |
| Leviticus 23:22 | As it is taught | Chullin 137a:12 | The Gemara cites the source of this dispute. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely remove the corner of your field when you reap, and you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor” (Leviticus 23:22). The phrase <b>“the gleaning of your harvest”</b> indicates that only such a gleaning is included, <b>and not gleaning from picking.</b> If one picks the crop by hand rather than harvesting it using agricultural tools, he is exempt from the mitzva to leave the gleanings for the poor. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Gleanings</b> are <b>only</b> those <b>that come due to harvesting</b> using agricultural tools. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | The verse states: “When you reap” | Chullin 137a:15 | <b>The verse states:</b> “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely remove the corner of your field by reaping, and you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest” (Leviticus 19:9). The superfluous term <b>“by reaping”</b> includes uprooting the crop. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the obligation extends to one who <b>picked</b> the crop by hand? <b>The verse states: “When you reap”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), which is also superfluous. It is derived from here that the mitzva applies to all ways of gathering the crop, provided they are the usual manner of harvesting that particular crop. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | you shall not gather; for the poor | Gittin 12a:2 | Second, one can argue from the opposite perspective: <b>The Rabbis state</b> their opinion <b>only there,</b> that one cannot acquire on behalf of the poor person, <b>as it is written:</b> “The corner of your field you shall not reap and the gleaning of your harvest <b>you shall not gather; for the poor</b> you shall leave them” (Leviticus 23:22), and the Sages expounded this verse by reading it as though there were no break in the middle: <b>You shall not gather for the poor,</b> i.e., the poor person must collect the produce for himself. <b>However, here,</b> where one seizes property on behalf of a creditor, this verse does not apply, and therefore the Rabbis did <b>not</b> rule that the action of the third party is ineffective. Consequently, it is possible that the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is not with regard to the issue of whether one can seize property on behalf of a creditor in a case where it is to the detriment of others. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | as the Merciful One states: “You shall not wholly reap the corner of | Makkot 16b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> where there is a prohibition, <b>as the Merciful One states: “You shall not wholly reap the corner of</b> your field” (Leviticus 23:22), followed by the mitzva: <b>“To the poor and the convert you shall leave them”</b> (Leviticus 23:22)? |
| Leviticus 23:22 | “I am the Lord your God” | Rosh Hashanah32a:9 | <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship? It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One verse states: <b>“I am the Lord your God”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), which is referring to God’s Kingship over the world; <b>and</b> two verses later it states: <b>“In the seventh month”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>This</b> teaches that God’s <b>Kingship</b> must be mentioned on Rosh HaShana. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | “You shall not wholly reap | Shabbat 23a:11 | <b>And from where do you say that we are concerned about suspicion? As it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: On account of four things the Torah said</b> that one should <b>leave <i>pe</i>’<i>a</i>,</b> crops for the poor in the corner of his field, specifically <b>at the end of his field.</b> Only after one has cut virtually the entire field should he leave an uncut corner for the poor. He should not designate an area for <i>pe</i>’<i>a</i> in the middle of the field in the course of cutting the field. The reasons for this ruling are: <b>Due to robbing the poor, and due to causing the poor to be idle, and due to suspicion, and due to</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not wholly reap</b> the corner of your field” (Leviticus 23:22). The Gemara explains: <b>Due to robbing the poor;</b> so <b>that the owner of the house will not see a time</b> when the field is <b>unoccupied</b> and there are no poor people in the area. If he could designate <i>pe</i>’<i>a</i> as he wished, there is room to suspect that <b>he</b> might <b>say to his poor relative: This is <i>pe</i>’<i>a</i>,</b> in the place and at the time that he chooses. He would thereby conceal the fact that there is <i>pe</i>’<i>a</i> in his field from other poor people. The result would be that, for all intents and purposes, he robbed <i>pe</i>’<i>a</i> from those with whom he did not share the information. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | “You shall leave | Temurah 6a:11 | The Gemara explains that <b>Abaye</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states: “You shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:10), and subsequently, it again states: <b>“You shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). The <b>superfluous</b> phrase teaches that the owner must give <i>pe’a</i> in any event, even if he harvests the grain and kneads it into dough. But in general, transgressions are effective. |
| Leviticus 23:22 | you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field” | Temurah 6a:9 | The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>],</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One stated:</b> And when you reap the harvest of your land, <b>you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), but one must leave a corner of the field for the poor. <b>And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pe’a</i> 1:5): The optimal way to fulfill <b>the mitzva of <i>pe’a</i></b> is for the owner <b>to separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, i.e., grain that has not been harvested. If <b>he did not separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, <b>he separates</b> it <b>from the sheaves</b> of grain that have already been harvested. If <b>he did not separate</b> it <b>from the sheaves, he separates</b> it <b>from the pile</b> of grain, <b>as long as he has not</b> yet <b>smoothed</b> the pile. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | remembering, with regard to Rosh HaShana, as it is written: “A solemn rest, memorial proclaimed with the blast | Rosh Hashanah11a:16 | It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana, Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were revisited</b> by God and conceived children. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>revisiting [<i>pekida</i>]</b> and another instance of the term <b>revisiting,</b> and by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>remembering [<i>zekhira</i>]</b> and another instance of the word <b>remembering. It is written about Rachel: “And God remembered Rachel”</b> (Genesis 30:22), <b>and it is written about Hannah: “And the Lord remembered her”</b> (I Samuel 1:19). <b>And</b> the meaning of these instances of the term <b>remembering</b> is <b>derived</b> from another instance of the term <b>remembering, with regard to Rosh HaShana, as it is written: “A solemn rest, memorial proclaimed with the blast</b> of a <i>shofar</i>” (Leviticus 23:24). From here it is derived that Rachel and Hannah were remembered by God on Rosh HaShana. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns [ terua ]” | Rosh Hashanah16a:17 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Why does one sound</b> [<b><i>tokin</i></b>] a blast <b>on Rosh HaShana?</b> The Gemara is astonished by the question: <b>Why do we sound</b> a blast? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the verse: <b>“Sound [<i>tiku</i>]</b> a <i>shofar</i>” (Psalms 81:4). <b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>Why does one sound</b> a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> in addition to a long continuous <i>shofar</i> blast [<i>tekia</i>]? The Gemara is still surprised by the question: <b>Sound a <i>terua</i>? The Merciful One states:</b> “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, <b>a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak asked about the common practice in Jewish communities, which is not explicitly stated in the Torah: <b>Why does one sound</b> a long, continuous <i>shofar</i> <b>blast [<i>tekia</i>] and</b> then a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> while the congregation is still <b>sitting</b> before the silent prayer, |
| Leviticus 23:24 | it is written: “A memorial of blasts” | Rosh Hashanah28b:1 | <b>But here,</b> with regard to a <i>shofar</i>, <b>it is written: “A memorial of blasts”</b> (Leviticus 23:24), which might have been understood as requiring conscious intent, <b>and this one was merely acting unawares,</b> without having any intent whatsoever of performing the mitzva. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that the absence of intent does not invalidate fulfillment of the mitzva, even in the case of <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently, Rava maintains</b> that the fulfillment of <b>mitzvot does not require intent.</b> That is to say, if one performs a mitzva, he fulfills his obligation even if he has no intention of doing so. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts” | Rosh Hashanah29b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> are <b>these matters;</b> from where is it derived that the <i>shofar</i> is not sounded on Shabbat? <b>Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: One verse says,</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana: <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts”</b> (Leviticus 23:24), which indicates that one should merely remember the <i>shofar</i> without actually sounding it. <b>And another verse says: “It is a day of blowing for you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), i.e., a day on which one must actually sound the <i>shofar</i>. This apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> the verse in which the <i>shofar</i> is only being remembered but not sounded, is referring <b>to a Festival that occurs on Shabbat; there,</b> the verse in which the <i>shofar</i> is actually sounded, is referring <b>to a Festival that occurs on a weekday.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:24 | a solemn rest, a memorial of blasts, a sacred convocation” | Rosh Hashanah32a:7 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> on Rosh HaShana <b>one recites</b> the blessings of <b>Kingship, Remembrances, and <i>Shofarot</i>? Rabbi Eliezer says: As it is written:</b> “In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have <b>a solemn rest, a memorial of blasts, a sacred convocation”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). This verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“A solemn rest,” this</b> is referring to the blessing of <b>the Sanctification of the Day; “a memorial,” this is Remembrances; “blasts,” this is <i>Shofarot</i>; “a sacred convocation”</b> this means <b>sanctify it by</b> abstaining from <b>performing</b> prohibited <b>labor.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:24 | “In the seventh month” | Rosh Hashanah32a:9 | <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship? It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One verse states: <b>“I am the Lord your God”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), which is referring to God’s Kingship over the world; <b>and</b> two verses later it states: <b>“In the seventh month”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>This</b> teaches that God’s <b>Kingship</b> must be mentioned on Rosh HaShana. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | for example: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts, a sacred convocation” | Rosh Hashanah32b:10 | With regard to a verse of <b>remembrance that</b> also <b>has</b> a mention of <b>sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>for example: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts, a sacred convocation”</b> (Leviticus 23:24), <b>one may recite it with the</b> verses of <b>remembrances, and</b> one <b>may</b> also <b>recite it with the</b> verses of <b><i>shofarot</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may recite it only with the</b> verses of <b>remembrances alone,</b> as it does not explicitly mention a <i>shofar</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [ terua ]” | Rosh Hashanah34a:2 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that there must be <b>three</b> sets <b>of three</b> blasts <b>each? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>shofar terua</i></b>]”(Leviticus 25:9); and another verse states: <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24); and a third verse states: <b>“It is a day of sounding [<i>terua</i>] the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1). <i>Terua</i> is mentioned three times in these verses, and a <i>terua</i> is always preceded and followed by a <i>tekia</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | seventh | Rosh Hashanah34a:3 | Since one of these verses deals with Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year, while two of them deal with Rosh HaShana, the Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? With regard to Rosh HaShana, <b>the verse states:</b> “Of the <b>seventh</b> month” (Leviticus 25:9), and with regard to Yom Kippur the verse likewise states: “In the <b>seventh</b> month” (Leviticus 23:24). It is derived <b>by verbal analogy</b> that any <i>shofar</i> blasts sounded on one of these days must also be sounded on the other. Consequently, on each day one must sound three sets of <i>tekia-terua-tekia</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | to Rosh HaShana: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [ terua ]” | Rosh Hashanah34a:9 | <b>And three <i>teruot</i> are stated</b> with regard <b>to Rosh HaShana: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24); “It is <b>a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>]</b> to you” (Numbers 29:1); <b>“Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:9). <b>And</b> there are <b>two <i>tekiot</i> for each and every one</b> of the <i>teruot</i>, one before and one after. |
| Leviticus 23:24 | shabbaton | Shabbat 24b:9 | <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is derived from a different source. In the verses that speak of the Festivals, as opposed to the term <b>Shabbat,</b> the term <b><i>shabbaton</i></b> (Leviticus 23:24) appears. |
| Leviticus 23:26 | “But on the tenth” | Sotah 41a:2 | § It is taught in the mishna that the High Priest receives the Torah scroll <b>and reads</b> the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26). Since these two portions are not adjacent to each other, the High Priest skips the section between the two portions. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 24a): <b>One may skip</b> sections when reading the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:26 | “But on the tenth” | Yoma 68b:13 | <b>The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scroll and gives it to the head of the synagogue</b> that stood on the Temple Mount; <b>and the head of the synagogue gives it to the deputy</b> High Priest, <b>and the Deputy gives it to the High Priest, and the High Priest stands and receives</b> the scroll from his hands. <b>And he reads</b> from the scroll the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1) <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26), <b>and furls the Torah scroll and places it on his bosom and says: More than what I have read before you is written here.</b> The Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“And on the tenth,” from the book of Numbers</b> (29:7), <b>he</b> then <b>reads by heart.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:26 | “But on the tenth” | Yoma 69b:17 | § It was taught in the mishna: <b>And he reads</b> from the scroll the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26). Although both of these portions appear in the book of Leviticus, they are not adjacent to one another. Perforce, the High Priest skipped the sections in between the two portions. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> It is taught in a mishna in tractate <i>Megilla</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>skip</b> sections when reading the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the Prophets, but one</b> may <b>not skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:27 | Doesn’t one fast on the tenth of Tishrei, | Berakhot 8b:3 | The Gemara wonders: <b>And does one fast on the ninth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Doesn’t one fast on the tenth of Tishrei,</b> as the Torah says at the beginning of that portion: “However, on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement; there shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27)? <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to tell you: One who eats and drinks on the ninth</b> day of Tishrei in preparation for the fast the next day, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he fasted on</b> both <b>the ninth and the tenth</b> of Tishrei. Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti cited this verse to Rav Beivai bar Abaye to teach him that Yom Kippur eve is dedicated to eating and drinking, not to completing the Torah portions one may have missed throughout the year. |
| Leviticus 23:27 | “It is Yom Kippur” | Chullin 101b:2 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>Shabbat and Yom Kippur</b> occur on the same day, if one acted <b>unwittingly and performed</b> prohibited <b>labor, from where</b> is it derived <b>that he is liable for this by itself and for that by itself,</b> i.e., he is liable to bring two sin offerings, for having transgressed both Shabbat and Yom Kippur? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall do no manner of work; <b>it is a Shabbat</b> for the Lord in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:3), and another verse states: <b>“It is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). The term “it is” in each verse teaches that each of these days is considered independently even when it occurs together with another holy day. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering because a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists. |
| Leviticus 23:27 | settled. | Chullin 120a:12 | The Gemara answers: Liquids and solids do not join together to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food. The reason for the <i>halakha</i> <b>there,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>is because</b> one is liable even for the consumption of a liquid that is not characterized as food if the <b>mind</b> of the one who consumes it is <b>settled.</b> This is because with regard to the fast of Yom Kippur the Torah is concerned with a person’s affliction, as the verse states: “You shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27). Therefore, one is liable on Yom Kippur for <b>any</b> eating that <b>settles his mind.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:27 | the verse states: “Yet | Keritot 7a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> rejects this opinion: <b>No, if you said</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering and a guilt offering, which do not atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> they do for <b>unwitting</b> sins, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to Yom Kippur, which does atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins? Yom Kippur effects atonement even in cases where offerings do not. <b>And since</b> it is the case that the atonement of Yom Kippur is far-reaching in that <b>it atones for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins, it follows that it <b>may atone</b> both <b>for those who repent and for those who do not repent.</b> To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states: “Yet</b> on the tenth day of this month it is Yom Kippur” (Leviticus 23:27). By means of the word “yet,” the verse <b>divided</b> and limited the atonement of Yom Kippur so that it atones only for those who repent. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:27 | it is Yom Kippur” | Keritot 7a:17 | The Gemara continues its analysis of this <i>baraita</i> by comparing it to another <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>raise a contradiction:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur shall atone only for</b> one <b>who fasted on it and did not perform labor on it and declared it a holy convocation.</b> With regard to one who <b>did not fast on it, or performed labor on it, or did not declare it a holy convocation,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur shall not atone</b> for him. To counter this <b>the verse states:</b> “Yet on the tenth day of this seventh month <b>it is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27); the additional emphasis of “it is” serves to teach that the day atones <b>in any case.</b> The ruling of this <i>baraita</i> disputes the one cited earlier, which states that Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent, <b>and both</b> are <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraitot</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>.</b> They <b>are difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:27 | “Only on the tenth day” | Megillah 24a:5 | § We learned further in the mishna: <b>One may skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Torah.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 68b): On Yom Kippur, the High Priest <b>reads</b> the section beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), and then he reads the section beginning with the verse: <b>“Only on the tenth day”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). <b>Doesn’t he skip</b> from the first section to the second section? |
| Leviticus 23:27 | the verse states: “Yet | Shevuot 13a:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since</b> it is the case that the atonement of Yom Kippur is more far-reaching in that <b>it atones for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins, it follows that <b>it should atone</b> both <b>for those who repent and for those who do not repent.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Yet</b> on the tenth day of this seventh month it is Yom Kippur” (Leviticus 23:27). The word “yet” serves to <b>divide</b> and limit the atonement of Yom Kippur in that it atones only for those who repent. |
| Leviticus 23:27 | it is Yom Kippur” | Shevuot 13a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But raise a contradiction,</b> setting one <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>,</b> i.e., the one just cited, <b>against</b> another <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>, as</b> in another <i>baraita</i> there <b>it is taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur would atone only if one fasted on it and declared it a holy convocation and did not perform labor on it. From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one did not fast on it and did not declare it a holy convocation and performed labor on it,</b> that it still atones? <b>The verse states:</b> “Yet on the tenth day of this seventh month <b>it is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). The additional emphasis on “it is” serves to teach that the day atones <b>in any case.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts the one cited above that states clearly that Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent. |
| Leviticus 23:27 | “But on the tenth | Yoma 76a:11 | § The mishna taught that as per the five prohibited activities on Yom Kippur it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in eating</b> and in drinking, and in bathing, and in smearing the body with oil, and in wearing shoes, and in conjugal relations. The Gemara asks: <b>These five afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur, to <b>what</b> do they <b>correspond?</b> Where is the Torah source or allusion to them? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> They are based on <b>the five</b> times that the <b>afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur are mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> It is stated: (1) <b>“And on the tenth</b> of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls” (Numbers 29:7); (2) <b>“But on the tenth</b> of this seventh month is the day of atonement, it shall be a holy convocation for you and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27); (3) “It shall be for you <b>a Shabbat of solemn rest,</b> and you shall afflict your souls (Leviticus 23:32); (4) <b>“It is a Shabbat of solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>]</b> for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:31); (5) <b>“And it shall be</b> a statute <b>for you</b> forever, in the seventh month on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:29). |
| Leviticus 23:28 | the verse states: “And you shall do no manner of labor on that same day” | Yoma 81a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> one who performs labor during the extension would <b>not be included in the punishment</b> of <i>karet</i>, <b>but he would be warned against</b> performing labor during the <b>extension</b> of the period of prohibition <b>of labor</b> with a prohibition incurring the punishment of lashes; therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall do no manner of labor on that same day”</b> (Leviticus 23:28). That teaches that <b>he is warned</b> not to perform labor on <b>that very day,</b> but <b>he is not warned against</b> performing labor during the <b>extension</b> of the period of prohibition <b>of labor,</b> and therefore he is not liable to receive lashes for doing so. |
| Leviticus 23:28 | same | Yoma 81a:19 | <b>Ravina said:</b> We did not properly understand the teaching of this <i>baraita</i>, as <b>this <i>tanna</i> derived</b> a verbal analogy from the words “on that <b>same</b> day” (Leviticus 23:29) stated with regard to affliction, and “on that <b>same</b> day” (Leviticus 23:28) stated with regard to labor. The Gemara comments: We must say that <b>it is available,</b> meaning that in both places, the phrase “on that same day” is unnecessary within its own context and comes only to teach this verbal analogy; <b>as, if it were not available, it could be refuted, as we refuted it</b> above. |
| Leviticus 23:29 | karet , | Nedarim 80b:5 | § The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do <b>the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, mean to <b>say</b> with regard to <b>bathing</b> that <b>when she does not bathe it involves affliction?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>Although one is prohibited from</b> performing <b>any</b> of the five activities associated with affliction on Yom Kippur, i.e., eating or drinking, bathing, anointing, engaging in sexual intercourse, and wearing leather shoes, <b>one is punished</b> with <b><i>karet</i> only when one eats or drinks or performs</b> prohibited <b>labor alone. And if you say</b> that <b>when</b> a woman <b>does not bathe there is affliction,</b> and for this reason a husband may nullify such a vow taken by his wife, then <b>if one bathes on Yom Kippur, he should be liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> in accordance with the verse “For whatever person shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off [<i>venikhreta</i>] from his people” (Leviticus 23:29), as he has failed to observe this form of affliction. |
| Leviticus 23:29 | shall not be afflicted | Yevamot 40a:6 | <b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> might refer to two types of eating and is saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes he may eat it with an appetite, and if he wishes he may eat it</b> though an act of <b>excessive eating,</b> forcing himself to eat despite already being fully satiated; perforce this is not correct, as does <b>excessive eating have the</b> legal <b>status of</b> an act of <b>eating? Didn’t Reish Lakish say: One who eats</b> through an act of <b>excessive eating on Yom Kippur is exempt from</b> the punishment of <i>karet</i> indicated in the verse: “For whatever soul it be that <b>shall not be afflicted</b> in that same day shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 23:29)? From this it is apparent that excessive eating does not have the legal status of an act of eating. |
| Leviticus 23:29 | shall not be afflicted” | Yoma 80a:1 | <b>All the measures</b> in the Torah connected to eating are the volume of <b>an olive-bulk, except for</b> the amount of <b>food</b> that renders objects <b>impure, because the verse changed its expression</b> in this case, <b>and the Sages altered the measure</b> accordingly. <b>The proof of this,</b> that the Sages gave it a different measure because the verse used different language for it, is from <b>Yom Kippur.</b> Also in the case of Yom Kippur the Sages assigned a different measure because the verse used a different phrase. The Gemara asks: <b>How did the</b> Sages learn that the <b>verse changed its expression?</b> They learned <b>from:</b> “Any soul which <b>shall not be afflicted”</b> (Leviticus 23:29). The verse does not state: Any soul that shall eat, but rather: “Any soul which shall not be afflicted.” <b>How did the Sages change its measure?</b> One does not violate the prohibition unless he has eaten <b>the volume of a large date-bulk,</b> as opposed to the usual olive-bulk. |
| Leviticus 23:29 | shall not be afflicted | Yoma 80b:9 | § <b>Reish Lakish said: One who eats</b> in <b>an excessive manner on Yom Kippur,</b> to the degree that he forces himself to continue eating even when full <b>is exempt,</b> e.g., one who ate beyond being satiated on Yom Kippur eve and then ate something else as soon as the fast began. <b>What is the reason</b> for that? Because the Torah does not mention the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur, but it <b>was written</b> “any soul which <b>shall not be afflicted</b> in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 23:29), <b>excluding one who harms</b> himself, e.g., one who does not enjoy his food at all. |
| Leviticus 23:29 | the verse states: “For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off | Yoma 81a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that performing labor during the <b>extension</b> of the period of prohibition <b>of labor is not punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> but not afflicting oneself during the <b>extension</b> of the period <b>of affliction is punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 23:29), which teaches that not afflicting oneself <b>on that very day</b> is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>, but</b> not afflicting oneself during <b>the extension</b> of the period <b>of affliction is not punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:29 | same | Yoma 81a:19 | <b>Ravina said:</b> We did not properly understand the teaching of this <i>baraita</i>, as <b>this <i>tanna</i> derived</b> a verbal analogy from the words “on that <b>same</b> day” (Leviticus 23:29) stated with regard to affliction, and “on that <b>same</b> day” (Leviticus 23:28) stated with regard to labor. The Gemara comments: We must say that <b>it is available,</b> meaning that in both places, the phrase “on that same day” is unnecessary within its own context and comes only to teach this verbal analogy; <b>as, if it were not available, it could be refuted, as we refuted it</b> above. |
| Leviticus 23:29 | mean: Get up and eat. | Yoma 81a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish said: Why is there no warning stated about affliction;</b> why did the Torah not state explicitly that it is prohibited to eat and drink on Yom Kippur? It is <b>because it was not possible</b> to write it that way. The Gemara explains: <b>How could</b> the Merciful One <b>write it? Let the Merciful One write: One shall not eat</b> on Yom Kippur. The term eat prohibits <b>eating the amount of an olive-bulk,</b> whereas on Yom Kippur the actual prohibited measure is a large date-bulk. <b>Let the Merciful One write: Do not be afflicted.</b> That indicates the opposite of affliction, and would <b>mean: Get up and eat.</b> Therefore, it is written: “For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 23:29). |
| Leviticus 23:30 | “I will destroy that soul | Yoma 74b:9 | <b>And if it is your wish to say</b> something to challenge this reasoning, the Gemara brings an additional proof: <b>Surely,</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to one who violates Yom Kippur: <b>“I will destroy that soul</b> from among his people” (Leviticus 23:30). Therefore, <b>affliction</b> is something <b>that destroys a soul. And what is that? That is</b> refraining from <b>eating and drinking,</b> since someone who does not eat and drink at all will die. The Torah is not referring to other afflictions that do not lead to death. These are the words of the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:30 | the verse states: “And whatsoever soul it be that does any manner of labor on that same day” | Yoma 81a:11 | § With regard to the prohibitions against eating and labor, the Gemara says: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the prohibitions relating to affliction on Yom Kippur <b>from here:</b> It is stated: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls, you shall do no manner of labor”</b> (Numbers 29:7). The Gemara considers: One <b>might</b> have thought that performing labor during the <b>extension</b> of the period of prohibition <b>of labor,</b> added before Yom Kippur actually begins, <b>is punishable</b> by <i>karet</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And whatsoever soul it be that does any manner of labor on that same day”</b> (Leviticus 23:30), which teaches that performing labor <b>on that very day is punishable by <i>karet</i>, but</b> labor performed during <b>the extension</b> of the period of prohibition <b>of labor is not punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:32 | “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month in the evening, | Berakhot 8b:2 | <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye thought to finish all the</b> Torah <b>portions of the entire year,</b> which he had been unable to complete at their appointed time, <b>on the eve of Yom Kippur</b> when he would have time to do so. But <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught him: It is written</b> with regard to Yom Kippur: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month in the evening,</b> from evening to evening you shall keep your Sabbath” (Leviticus 23:32). |
| Leviticus 23:32 | the eve of Yom Kippur, as Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught: “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month | Pesachim 68b:11 | The Gemara relates: <b>Mar, son of Ravina, would spend the entire year fasting</b> during the day and eating only sparsely at night, <b>except for <i>Shavuot</i>, Purim, and the eve of Yom Kippur.</b> He made these exceptions for the following reasons: <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> because <b>it is the day on which the Torah was given</b> and there is a mitzva to demonstrate one’s joy on that day; <b>Purim</b> because <b>“days of feasting and gladness” is written</b> about it; <b>the eve of Yom Kippur, as Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught: “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month</b> in the evening, from evening to evening you shall keep your Sabbath” (Leviticus 23:32). <b>But does one fast on the ninth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Doesn’t one fast on the tenth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Rather,</b> this comes <b>to tell you: One who eats and drinks on the ninth, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he fasted on</b> both <b>the ninth and the tenth</b> of Tishrei. |
| Leviticus 23:32 | “From evening to evening | Rosh Hashanah20b:9 | § <b>The Master said</b> above: In order for a day to be sanctified as the New Moon, <b>it is necessary that</b> both <b>the night and the day be of the new</b> moon. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The verse states: <b>“From evening to evening</b> shall you celebrate your Shabbat” (Leviticus 23:32). This teaches that the day follows the night for all the calculations pertaining to the Festivals and New Moons. |
| Leviticus 23:32 | “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth of the month | Rosh Hashanah9a:5 | The Gemara asks: If so, <b>from where does Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive this principle <b>that</b> one <b>extends</b> a sacred time period by <b>adding from the profane to the sacred</b> both before and after? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, in reference to Yom Kippur: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth of the month</b> in the evening” (Leviticus 23:32). One <b>might</b> have thought that one must begin to fast the entire day <b>on the ninth</b> of the month. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “In the evening.”</b> But <b>if</b> it is so that Yom Kippur begins <b>in the evening,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that one need only begin to fast <b>from when it is dark,</b> after nightfall, when the tenth day of the month begins. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “On the ninth.” How so;</b> how is this to be accomplished? <b>One begins to fast</b> on the ninth of the month <b>while it is still day. This teaches that one</b> extends a sacred time period by <b>adding</b> at the beginning <b>from the profane to the sacred.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:32 | The verse states: “From evening to evening | Rosh Hashanah9a:6 | From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this addition is made <b>at the beginning</b> of Yom Kippur. But <b>from where</b> do I derive that a similar addition is made <b>at the end of</b> Yom Kippur? <b>The verse states: “From evening to evening</b> shall you rest on your Shabbat” (Leviticus 23:32), which teaches that just as Yom Kippur is extended at the beginning, so too, it is extended at the end. |
| Leviticus 23:32 | a Shabbat of solemn rest, | Yoma 76a:11 | § The mishna taught that as per the five prohibited activities on Yom Kippur it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in eating</b> and in drinking, and in bathing, and in smearing the body with oil, and in wearing shoes, and in conjugal relations. The Gemara asks: <b>These five afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur, to <b>what</b> do they <b>correspond?</b> Where is the Torah source or allusion to them? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> They are based on <b>the five</b> times that the <b>afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur are mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> It is stated: (1) <b>“And on the tenth</b> of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls” (Numbers 29:7); (2) <b>“But on the tenth</b> of this seventh month is the day of atonement, it shall be a holy convocation for you and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27); (3) “It shall be for you <b>a Shabbat of solemn rest,</b> and you shall afflict your souls (Leviticus 23:32); (4) <b>“It is a Shabbat of solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>]</b> for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:31); (5) <b>“And it shall be</b> a statute <b>for you</b> forever, in the seventh month on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:29). |
| Leviticus 23:32 | you shall rest on your Shabbat” | Yoma 81b:1 | Yom Kippur <b>itself is called “Shabbat,” as it is written:</b> “From evening until evening, <b>you shall rest on your Shabbat”</b> (Leviticus 23:32). The Gemara compares the various opinions. <b>Granted, Rav Pappa did not say as Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> did because <b>a verse that is written about the matter itself is preferable</b> to a verbal analogy. <b>But what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Pappa?</b> |
| Leviticus 23:32 | “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month | Yoma 81b:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>He requires this</b> verse of “keep your Shabbat” <b>for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month</b> at evening, from evening until evening, you shall rest on your Shabbat” (Leviticus 23:32). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should start to afflict oneself on the ninth</b> of Tishrei; therefore, <b>the verse states “at evening.” If</b> the Torah had stated only <b>“at evening,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the fast starts only <b>when darkness falls;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states “on the ninth,”</b> implying that one begins to fast on the ninth of Tishrei. <b>How</b> can these verses be reconciled? <b>One begins to fast while it is still daytime; from here</b> it is derived <b>that one</b> sanctifies and <b>extends from</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> weekday <b>to</b> the <b>sacred</b> day of Yom Kippur. |
| Leviticus 23:32 | The verse states: “From evening until evening” | Yoma 81b:3 | <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one must add time <b>at the beginning</b> of Yom Kippur. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one adds time <b>at the conclusion of</b> Yom Kippur? <b>The verse states: “From evening until evening”</b> (Leviticus 23:32), implying that one adds at the end as well, just as he does at the beginning. <b>And I</b> have derived <b>only</b> the mitzva of adding to <b>Yom Kippur; from where</b> is it derived that one must also sanctify and append time before and after <b>Festivals? The verse states: “You shall rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:32), to teach that this rule applies even to Festivals, on which one is commanded to rest. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one adds an extension to <b>Festivals; from where</b> do I derive that one must also sanctify and append to <b><i>Shabbatot</i>? The verse states: “Your Shabbat”</b> (Leviticus 23:32). <b>How so? Every place the term: Rest [<i>shevut</i>] is stated,</b> it teaches <b>from here that one</b> sanctifies and <b>appends from</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> weekday <b>to</b> the <b>sacred.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:32 | “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth | Yoma 81b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> who learns a verbal analogy from the words “that <b>same</b> day,” “that <b>same</b> day,” <b>what does he do with</b> the phrase: <b>“On the ninth day of the month”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it, in accordance with</b> that <b>which Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught. As Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught:</b> It states: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth</b> day of the month” (Leviticus 23:32). <b>But does one afflict oneself on the ninth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Doesn’t one</b> in fact <b>afflict oneself on the tenth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes <b>to tell you: Anyone who eats and drinks on the ninth</b> of Tishrei and then fasts on the tenth, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he fasted on</b> both the <b>ninth and the tenth.</b> The verse alludes to this when it states that the fast is on the ninth. |
| Leviticus 23:34 | as it is stated: “The festival of Sukkot to the Lord, seven days” | Beitzah 30b:9 | <b>But didn’t Rav Sheshet say in the name of Rabbi Akiva: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the wood of a <i>sukka</i></b> is <b>prohibited</b> to be used for any other use <b>all seven</b> days of the Festival? It is <b>as it is stated: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> to the Lord, seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:34). <b>And it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> in explanation of this that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that just as the name of Heaven takes effect upon the Festival peace-offering, so too, does the name of Heaven take effect upon the <i>sukka</i>? The verse states: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> to the Lord, seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:34), from which it is learned: <b>Just as the Festival</b> offering is consecrated <b>to the Lord, so too, the <i>sukka</i></b> is consecrated <b>to the Lord.</b> Since the wood of the <i>sukka</i> is compared to consecrated objects, how may one stipulate a condition with regard to it? |
| Leviticus 23:34 | fifteenth | Kiddushin 34b:1 | It is <b>necessary</b> to state this verse for another reason, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, where the verse states: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), <b>from</b> Passover, where the verse states: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the <b>festival of Passover”</b> (Leviticus 23:6). One would then say that <b>just as there women are obligated</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on the first night of Passover, despite the fact that it is a time-bound mitzva, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of residing in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>women are obligated.</b> Therefore it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to use the term “the homeborn” to exclude women from the obligation to reside in a <i>sukka</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:34 | fifteenth | Kiddushin 34b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the verses concerning <b><i>matza</i> and assembly</b> are <b>also necessary,</b> each for its own reason, and they are not two verses that come as one either. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>For what</b> purpose are both of them <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> that women are obligated in the mitzva of <b>assembly but had not written</b> that they are obligated in eating <b><i>matza</i>, I would say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to Passover, where the verse states: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the festival of Passover” (Leviticus 23:6), from <i>Sukkot</i>, where the verse states: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), teaching that women are exempt from eating <i>matza</i>, just as they are exempt from residing in a <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, it is necessary for a verse to teach that women are obligated in eating <i>matza</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:34 | fifteenth | Sukkah 27a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> There is a verbal analogy between the festivals of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:34). <b>And it is stated:</b> “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the festival of <i>matzot</i> unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:6) <b>with regard to</b> the festival of <b>Passover. Just as there,</b> with regard to Passover, on <b>the first night</b> there is <b>an obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>and from that point onward it is optional,</b> as from that point onward the only obligation is to refrain from eating leaven, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, on <b>the first night</b> there <b>is an obligation</b> to eat in the <i>sukka</i> <b>and from that point onward it is optional.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:34 | fifteenth | Sukkah 28b:2 | <b>Rava said</b> a different reason: A <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>was necessary</b> to teach that a woman is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, about which it is written: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), <b>from</b> Passover, about which it is written: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the <b>festival of <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:6). <b>Just as there, women are obligated</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover even though it is a time-bound mitzva, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, <b>women are obligated.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>teaches us</b> that they are exempt. |
| Leviticus 23:34 | the verse states: “The festival of Sukkot is seven days unto the Lord” | Sukkah 9a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara explains that it is as <b>the verse states: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is seven days unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:34), indicating that <b>we require a <i>sukka</i> established for the sake of the Festival.</b> A <i>sukka</i> not constructed expressly for the Festival is unfit. |
| Leviticus 23:35 | “You shall do no kind of laborious work” | Chagigah 18a:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> concerning the same topic: With regard to the first day of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>, the verse states: <b>“You shall do no kind of laborious work”</b> (Leviticus 23:35), followed by “seven days, you shall bring an offering made by fire to the Lord,” which <b>teaches that the performance of labor is prohibited during the intermediate Festival days;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This <b>is not necessary, since it is stated</b> earlier in that chapter: <b>“These are the appointed Festivals of the Lord,</b> holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season” (Leviticus 23:4). <b>With regard to what is the verse speaking? If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>first</b> day of the Festival, <b>it has already</b> explicitly <b>stated “a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39) with regard to that day; <b>if</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>seventh, it has already stated “a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39) with regard to that day as well. <b>Therefore, the verse can be speaking only of the intermediate Festival days, teaching you that the performance of labor is prohibited on them.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:36 | to the seventh day of Passover, and it is stated: “Assembly” | Chagigah 9a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that if one did not bring his Festival peace-offering on the first day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, he may bring it even on the Eighth Day of Assembly, despite the fact that it is a separate Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated: “Assembly”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), with regard <b>to the seventh day of Passover, and it is stated: “Assembly”</b> (Leviticus 23:36), with regard <b>to the eighth day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Passover, the day of assembly, i.e., the seventh day of Passover, is available <b>for redress,</b> as it is certainly part of the Festival, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of <i>Sukkot</i>, the Eighth Day of Assembly is available <b>for redress.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:37 | “An offering, and libations” | Bekhorot 17a:19 | <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> Along these lines, <b>we can say also</b> that if <b>one trellised a grapevine over a fig</b> tree, <b>its wine is unfit</b> to be used <b>for libations. What is the reason?</b> The verse states: <b>“An offering, and libations”</b> (Leviticus 23:37). <b>Just as an offering</b> must be an animal <b>that has not changed, so too, libations</b> must come from wine produced by vines <b>that were not changed.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:37 | each on its own day” | Megillah 20b:12 | <b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for taking the <i>lulav</i>, as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). Daytime is also the time <b>for sounding the <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “It is a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1). Likewise, the time <b>for</b> the <b>additional offerings</b> is day, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to these offerings: “To sacrifice an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and libations, <b>each on its own day”</b> (Leviticus 23:37). <b>And</b> this is also so <b>for the additional prayer,</b> because <b>the Sages made it equivalent to</b> those <b>additional offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:37 | an animal offering, and libations, | Menachot 44b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning the additional offerings sacrificed on <i>Sukkot</i> and the Eighth Day of Assembly states: <b>“And their meal offering and their libations</b> for the bulls, for the rams and for the lambs” (Numbers 29:18). This indicates that after the animal is sacrificed, one must <b>bring</b> the <b>meal offering and then bring</b> the <b>libations. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that since the verse states: “To bring an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, <b>an animal offering, and libations,</b> each on its own day” (Leviticus 23:37), one must <b>bring</b> the <b>animal offering and then bring</b> the <b>libations,</b> and only then bring the meal offering. |
| Leviticus 23:37 | a sacrifice, and libations, | Menachot 79a:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to statement of the mishna concerning a case where the libations of an animal offering were consecrated and the animal was then discovered to be unfit, <b>Ze’eiri says: Libations are sanctified only upon the slaughter of the offering. What is the reason</b> for this? The <b>verse states:</b> “To bring an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, <b>a sacrifice, and libations,</b> each on its own day” (Leviticus 23:37), indicating that the libations complement the offering and are consecrated only upon its slaughter. |
| Leviticus 23:37 | them [ otam ] | Rosh Hashanah25a:13 | Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: My teacher, allow me to say before you one matter that you</b> yourself once <b>taught me. He said to him: Speak. He said to him: It states</b> with respect to the Festivals: “The appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations (Leviticus 23:2). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> in their season” (Leviticus 23:4). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:37). <b>Three times</b> the verses use the term: Them [<i>otam</i>], which can also be read as you [<i>atem</i>], in plural. |
| Leviticus 23:37 | each day | Temurah 14a:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states in the section of the Torah dealing with additional offerings: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and libations, <b>each day</b> on its own day” (Leviticus 23:37). This <b>teaches that the entire day is fit for</b> bringing the <b>additional</b> offerings. The term: <b>“On its own day,” teaches that if the day has passed and</b> the priests <b>did not bring</b> the additional offerings, <b>one is not obligated to</b> bring <b>their compensation,</b> and the offering cannot be brought at a later date. |
| Leviticus 23:37 | griddle-cake | Yoma 34a:2 | Abaye continued: The sacrifice of the <b>meal-offering</b> precedes the sacrifice of the High Priest’s daily <b>griddle-cake</b> offering, half of which he sacrifices in the morning and half in the afternoon, as the verse states: “To bring offerings by fire to the Lord, burnt-offerings, meal-offerings, sacrifices, and libations, on each day what is proper to it” (Leviticus 23:37). Since the Torah states <b>burnt-offerings and meal-offerings,</b> apparently the daily burnt-offering precedes the meal-offering. And since the meal-offering is part of the burnt-offering sacrifice, it precedes the griddle-cake offering, which is a meal-offering unrelated to the burnt-offering. |
| Leviticus 23:39 | stated “a solemn rest” | Chagigah 18a:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> concerning the same topic: With regard to the first day of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>, the verse states: <b>“You shall do no kind of laborious work”</b> (Leviticus 23:35), followed by “seven days, you shall bring an offering made by fire to the Lord,” which <b>teaches that the performance of labor is prohibited during the intermediate Festival days;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This <b>is not necessary, since it is stated</b> earlier in that chapter: <b>“These are the appointed Festivals of the Lord,</b> holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season” (Leviticus 23:4). <b>With regard to what is the verse speaking? If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>first</b> day of the Festival, <b>it has already</b> explicitly <b>stated “a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39) with regard to that day; <b>if</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>seventh, it has already stated “a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39) with regard to that day as well. <b>Therefore, the verse can be speaking only of the intermediate Festival days, teaching you that the performance of labor is prohibited on them.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:39 | harishon ? And furthermore, there it is written: “On the first [ harishon ] day a solemn rest and on the eighth day a solemn rest” | Pesachim 5a:10 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so, there too,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to say <b><i>harishon</i>? And furthermore, there it is written: “On the first [<i>harishon</i>] day a solemn rest and on the eighth day a solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 23:39). Here too, <b>say</b> that <b>first means previous,</b> the day preceding the Festival. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>It is different there, as the verse said: “And on the eighth day a solemn rest,”</b> from which it can be inferred that <b>just as</b> the <b>eighth</b> means the <b>eighth</b> day <b>of the Festival,</b> so <b>too, <i>rishon</i></b> is referring to the <b>first</b> day <b>of the Festival.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:39 | “Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land” | Rosh Hashanah7a:6 | <b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is derived that Nisan is the first of the months <b>from here.</b> The verse states: <b>“Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land”</b> (Leviticus 23:39). <b>Which is the month in which there is a gathering</b> of the grain of the field before the rains begin? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Tishrei, and it is called the seventh</b> month. Therefore, Nisan is the first month of the year. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “The fruit of goodly trees [ hadar ], branches of palm trees” | Berakhot 57a:9 | <b>Rav Yosef says: One who sees a goat in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his year will be blessed;</b> one who sees <b>goats, his years will be blessed, as it is stated: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,</b> for the food of your household; and sustenance for your maidens” (Proverbs 27:27). <b>One who sees myrtle in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his property will be successful. And if he does not</b> own <b>property,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will receive an inheritance. Ulla said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: This</b> applies exclusively to a case <b>where he saw</b> them <b>on their stem. One who sees a citron [<i>etrog</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>he is honored [<i>hadur</i>] before his Creator, as it is stated</b> with regard to the citron: <b>“The fruit of goodly trees [<i>hadar</i>], branches of palm trees”</b> (Leviticus 23:40). <b>One who sees a palm branch [<i>lulav</i>] in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>he has but one heart for his Father in heaven.</b> <i>Lulav</i> is interpreted homiletically as <i>lo lev</i>, he has a heart. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | for taking the lulav , as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day | Megillah 20b:12 | <b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for taking the <i>lulav</i>, as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). Daytime is also the time <b>for sounding the <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “It is a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1). Likewise, the time <b>for</b> the <b>additional offerings</b> is day, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to these offerings: “To sacrifice an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and libations, <b>each on its own day”</b> (Leviticus 23:37). <b>And</b> this is also so <b>for the additional prayer,</b> because <b>the Sages made it equivalent to</b> those <b>additional offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “And you shall take” [ ulkaḥtem ]” | Menachot 27a:20 | <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>that are in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2), and the term “shall be” indicates an indispensable requirement. <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>of the <i>lulav</i>,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, as the verse states: <b>“And you shall take” [<i>ulkaḥtem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), which alludes to: <b>A complete taking [<i>lekiḥa tamma</i>],</b> comprising all four species. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves | Pesachim 38a:4 | With regard to <b>a citron too,</b> a similar conclusion can be drawn, <b>as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves</b> on the first day a fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). Here too, the expression <b>“for yourselves”</b> indicates that what you take <b>must belong to you. However,</b> with regard to <b><i>matza</i>, is it written</b> that you must use <b>your</b> own <b><i>matza</i>?</b> Since there is no such requirement, it stands to reason that even consecrated <i>matza</i> is valid for this mitzva. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “And you shall take for yourselves on the first [ harishon ] day | Pesachim 5a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is <b>so,</b> consider a verse written with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>“And you shall take for yourselves on the first [<i>harishon</i>] day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). <b>So too,</b> in this case, does <b><i>harishon</i> mean</b> the day <b>previous</b> to the Festival? Clearly, one is not obligated to take the four species on the fourteenth of Tishrei, the eve of <i>Sukkot</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” | Pesachim 5a:8 | The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>There it is different, as it is written</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:40). <b>Just as the seventh</b> of these seven days is <b>the seventh day of the Festival,</b> so <b>too,</b> the <b>first</b> of these days is the <b>first</b> day <b>of the Festival</b> itself, not the day before <i>Sukkot</i>. However, where it is not explicitly stated, <i>rishon</i> means the day before the Festival. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | day, | Shabbat 131b:2 | It was taught that <b>the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i> and all its facilitators override Shabbat;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where does Rabbi Eliezer</b> derive <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>If</b> you say he derives it <b>from</b> the mitzvot of the <b><i>omer</i> and the two loaves,</b> whose facilitators override Shabbat, this can be refuted by saying that the performance of facilitating actions is permitted on Shabbat in these cases <b>because they are for the necessities of</b> Temple service to God on <b>High,</b> as they are connected to the sacrificial service, which proceeds even on Shabbat. <b>Rather,</b> we can say that he derives it from the fact that <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall take for yourselves <b>on the</b> first <b>day,</b> the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of thick-leaved trees, and willows of the river, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Leviticus 23:40), from which he infers: <b>“On the</b> first <b>day,”</b> meaning that one is obligated to take it on the first day <b>even</b> if it occurs <b>on Shabbat.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day | Sukkah 11b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> From where does he derive this requirement by Torah law? The Gemara answers: By means of a verbal analogy, <b>he derives</b> the term <b>taking,</b> written with regard to the four species, <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop. It is written there,</b> in the context of the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb in Egypt: <b>“Take a bundle of hyssop”</b> (Exodus 12:22), <b>and it is written here,</b> in the context of the four species: <b>“And you shall take for yourselves on the first day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Leviticus 23:40). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, the mitzva to take the hyssop is specifically <b>in a bundle, so too here,</b> the mitzva to take the four species is specifically <b>in a bundle. And the Rabbis</b> hold: <b>We do not derive</b> the term <b>taking from</b> the term <b>taking</b> by means of the verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | Rabbi Eliezer says: Just as a person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the Festival with the lulav of another, as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm” | Sukkah 27b:4 | <b>It is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Just as a person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the Festival with the <i>lulav</i> of another, as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), and the Sages derive from the phrase: Shall take for yourselves, that it must be taken <b>from your own</b> and not from that of someone else, <b>so too, a person does not fulfill his obligation with the <i>sukka</i> of another, as it is written: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), and the Sages derive from the term “for yourself” that it must be taken <b>from your own.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:40 | for yourselves | Sukkah 29b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, a dry</b> <i>lulav</i> is unfit both on the first day and subsequently. It is unfit for use because the term <i>hadar</i> is used with regard to the four species, from which it is derived that <b>we require beauty. And</b> since in a dry <i>lulav</i> <b>there is not</b> beauty, it is unfit. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a stolen</b> <i>lulav</i>, <b>granted,</b> on <b>the first day of the Festival</b> it is unfit, <b>as it is written:</b> “And you shall take <b>for yourselves</b> on the first day” (Leviticus 23:40), indicating that the four species must be taken <b>from your own</b> property. <b>However,</b> beginning <b>on the second day of the Festival, why</b> does one <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation with a stolen <i>lulav</i>? |
| Leviticus 23:40 | Just as the etrog requires beauty, so too, the lulav requires beauty. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: We do not liken the lulav to the etrog . However, with regard to an etrog , everyone agrees that we require beauty [ hadar ] | Sukkah 31a:12 | § It was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A dry <i>lulav</i> is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>fit. Rava said: The dispute is</b> specifically <b>with regard to a <i>lulav</i>, as the Rabbis hold: We liken the <i>lulav</i> to the <i>etrog</i>,</b> based on their juxtaposition in the verse. <b>Just as the <i>etrog</i> requires beauty, so too, the <i>lulav</i> requires beauty. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: We do not liken the <i>lulav</i> to the <i>etrog</i>. However, with regard to an <i>etrog</i>, everyone agrees that we require beauty [<i>hadar</i>]</b> as the verse states: “Fruit of a beautiful tree” (Leviticus 23:40) and a dry <i>etrog</i> does not meet that criterion. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “Boughs of a dense-leaved tree” | Sukkah 32b:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is written: <b>“Boughs of a dense-leaved tree”</b> (Leviticus 23:40); this is referring to <b>a tree whose leaves obscure its tree. And which tree is that? You must say it is the myrtle tree.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And say</b> it is <b>the olive</b> tree, whose leaves obscure the tree. The Gemara answers: <b>We require a “dense-leaved”</b> tree, whose leaves are in a chain-like configuration, <b>and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case with an olive tree. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day | Sukkah 33a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> From where does he derive this requirement by Torah law? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to the four species <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> in the context of the four species: <b>“And you shall take for yourselves on the first day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). <b>and it is written there,</b> in the context of the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb in Egypt: <b>“Take a bundle of hyssop”</b> (Exodus 12:22), <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, the mitzva to take the hyssop is specifically <b>in a bundle, so too here,</b> the mitzva to take the four species is specifically <b>in a bundle. And the Rabbis</b> hold: <b>We do not derive</b> the term <b>taking from</b> the term <b>taking</b> by means of the verbal analogy. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | The Sages taught: “Willows of the brook” | Sukkah 33b:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: “Willows of the brook”</b> (Leviticus 23:40) means willows <b>that grow by the brook. Alternatively, “willows of the brook”</b> is an allusion to the tree in question. It is a tree <b>whose leaf is elongated like a brook.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:40 | Rabbi Yishmael says: “The fruit of a beautiful tree” | Sukkah 34b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: “The fruit of a beautiful tree”</b> (Leviticus 23:40); that is <b>one</b> <i>etrog</i>. <b>“Branches of a date palm”;</b> that is <b>one</b> <i>lulav</i>. Based on tradition, <i>kappot</i> is written without the letter <i>vav</i>. Although the word is vocalized in the plural, the lack of the <i>vav</i> indicates that only one is required. <b>“Boughs of a dense-leaved tree”;</b> these are <b>three,</b> as the verse is referring to a branch with several stems. <b>“Willows of the brook”;</b> these are <b>two,</b> as it is plural. <b>Even if</b> the tops of <b>two are severed and</b> the top of <b>one is not severed,</b> it is fit. <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: Even if</b> the tops of <b>all three are severed,</b> it is fit. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Just as</b> there is <b>one <i>lulav</i> and one <i>etrog</i>, so too,</b> there is <b>one myrtle branch and one willow branch.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “And you shall take | Sukkah 41b:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that one does not fulfill his obligation with the <i>lulav</i> of another on the first day of the Festival? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall take</b> for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). The use of second person plural in the phrase: “And you shall take,” indicates <b>that there should be taking in the hand of each and every</b> person. The word <b>yourselves</b> in the phrase “take for yourselves” means: <b>From your own, to exclude a borrowed or stolen</b> <i>lulav</i>. <b>From here the Sages stated: A person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of</b> the <b>Festival with the <i>lulav</i> of another unless</b> the other <b>gave it to him as</b> a full-fledged <b>gift,</b> as in that case it belongs to him. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | As it was taught | Sukkah 43a:6 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that by Torah</b> law the mitzva of <i>lulav</i> on the first day <b>is</b> in effect even <b>in the outlying areas?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Leviticus 23:40). The Sages parse the phrases and terms in the verse. In the phrase <b>“And you shall take,”</b> the plural form of you is used, indicating <b>that there</b> should <b>be taking in the hand of each and every one,</b> and no one can fulfill the obligation on another’s behalf. |
| Leviticus 23:40 | He derives it from the end of the verse: “And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” | Sukkah 43a:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is as <b>the verse states: On the day,</b> indicating that the obligation exists every day of the Festival, <b>and even on Shabbat.</b> <br>The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with</b> the verse: <b>On the day?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They require it</b> to teach that the mitzva of taking the <i>lulav</i> is specifically <b>during the day and not at night.</b> <br>The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Eliezer</b> derive that the <i>lulav</i> is taken <b>during the day and not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from the end of the verse: “And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), indicating that the obligation to take the <i>lulav</i> is during the <b>days and not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> <br>The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> why don’t they derive it from that verse? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it was derived <b>from there, I would have said: Derive days</b> written with regard to <i>lulav</i> <b>from days</b> written with regard to <b><i>sukka</i></b> by means of a verbal analogy; <b>just as there,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, it means <b>days and even nights, here too,</b> with regard to <i>lulav</i>, it means <b>days and even nights.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:40 | branches | Sukkah 45b:8 | § The mishna continues: <b>As its performance during the week,</b> so is its performance on Shabbat. And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, on the seventh day of the Festival they would bring palm branches to the Temple. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka?</b> It is <b>as it is written:</b> “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, <b>branches</b> of a date palm” (Leviticus 23:40). Branches in the plural indicates that <b>two</b> branches must be taken, <b>one for the <i>lulav</i> and one for</b> placement around <b>the altar. And the Rabbis say:</b> Although the word is vocalized in the plural, based on tradition it <b>is written <i>kappot</i>,</b> without the letter <i>vav</i>. Therefore, it is interpreted as if it were written <i>kappat</i>, indicating that only one palm branch need be taken. |
| Leviticus 23:41 | “You shall observe [ vaḥaggotem ] it as a Festival to the Lord | Beitzah 19a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>to Festival peace-offerings,</b> an obligation of the Festival, <b>with respect to placing hands</b> on them, <b>and to burnt-offerings of appearance,</b> which must be brought over the course of the Festival, <b>with respect to sacrificing</b> them. As <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that the verse <b>“You shall observe [<i>vaḥaggotem</i>] it as a Festival to the Lord</b> seven days in the year” (Leviticus 23:41) indicates: <b>Festival peace-offerings [<i>ḥagiga</i>], yes,</b> they may be sacrificed even on a Festival day, but <b>burnt-offerings of appearance, no,</b> they may not. <b>And Beit Hillel hold: “To the Lord”</b> means that <b>anything</b> brought <b>as</b> an offering <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed throughout the seven days of the holiday, even on the actual Festival day. |
| Leviticus 23:41 | to the Lord” | Beitzah 20b:7 | <b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel in support of their own position: <b>But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), which indicates that for you may food be prepared, <b>but not for the Most High? Beit Hillel said to them: But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “You shall observe it as a Festival <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:41), which teaches: <b>Anything</b> sacrificed <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed? <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “for you”?</b> It means <b>for you, but not for gentiles; for you, but not for dogs.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:41 | “And you shall celebrate it as a Festival [ veḥagotem ] to the Lord” | Chagigah 10b:2 | § The mishna taught that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Festival peace</b>-offerings are like mountains suspended by a hair. The Gemara asks: But <b>they are written</b> in the Torah. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to say this <b>in accordance with that which Rav Pappa said to Abaye: From where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> verse: <b>“And you shall celebrate it as a Festival [<i>veḥagotem</i>] to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:41), is referring to <b>an animal offering? Perhaps the Merciful One is</b> simply <b>saying: Celebrate a Festival.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:41 | “And you shall keep it a feast to the Lord seven days” | Chagigah 9a:10 | The Gemara comments: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof <b>from here, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that deals with the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>“And you shall keep it a feast to the Lord seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:41). One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>may continue to celebrate</b> by bringing the Festival peace-offering <b>all seven</b> days of the Festival. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It,”</b> which teaches: <b>It,</b> i.e., the first day of the Festival, <b>you shall celebrate</b> with these offerings, <b>and you may not celebrate all seven</b> days. <b>If so, why is “seven” stated? For redress,</b> i.e., if one failed to bring an offering on the first day he may do so all seven days. |
| Leviticus 23:41 | The verse states: “You shall keep it in the seventh month” | Chagigah 9a:11 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one did not celebrate</b> by bringing the Festival peace-offering <b>on the first day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>that he may continue to celebrate throughout the pilgrimage Festival and</b> even on <b>the last festival day</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, which is the Eighth Day of Assembly? <b>The verse states: “You shall keep it in the seventh month”</b> (Leviticus 23:41), which indicates that one may bring the Festival offerings even after the seven days of the Festival. <b>If</b> the verse said only: <b>“In the seventh month,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one</b> may <b>continue to celebrate</b> by bringing the offering at any time during the rest of <b>the entire month.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It,”</b> indicating that <b>you celebrate it,</b> i.e., any of the Festival days, <b>and you may not celebrate outside of</b> these days. |
| Leviticus 23:41 | “And you shall celebrate it as a Festival for the Lord, seven days in the year; | Pesachim 70b:10 | <b>Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Safra: The verse said</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>“And you shall celebrate it as a Festival for the Lord, seven days in the year;</b> it shall be a statute forever in your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month” (Leviticus 23:41). Now is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>seven</b> days? <b>They are eight</b> days, as the Eighth Day of Assembly is always celebrated at the conclusion of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rather, from here</b> we derive <b>that the Festival peace-offering</b> [<b><i>ḥagiga</i></b>], about which the verse states: “And you shall celebrate [<i>veḥagotem</i>] it,” <b>does not override Shabbat.</b> Since every eight-day period contains a Shabbat, the Torah said that the Festival [<i>ḥag</i>] is celebrated, i.e., the Festival peace-offering [<i>ḥagiga</i>] can be brought the entire seven days of the Festival. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | since it is written: “In sukkot shall you reside | Arakhin 3b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside</b> seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), one can argue as follows: <b>The Master said</b> that this teaches: <b>Reside seven days as you dwell</b> in your permanent home: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>dwelling,</b> a <b>man and his wife</b> typically reside together, <b>so too,</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i></b> must be performed by <b>a man and his wife</b> residing together. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are</b> occupied <b>with</b> the Temple <b>service</b> during the Festival and are not free to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> together with their wives, perhaps they <b>should not be obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | should be flogged | Eruvin 96a:5 | <b>And furthermore,</b> according to this opinion, <b>one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the Eighth Day</b> of Assembly <b>should be flogged</b> for violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, as he adds to the mitzva of: “You shall dwell in booths for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42). Yet the Sages instituted that outside of Eretz Yisrael, Jews must observe <i>Sukkot</i> for eight days, even though one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the eighth night outside of Eretz Yisrael transgresses a Torah law. <b>Rather, it is clear as we originally answered,</b> i.e., you must accept one of the other explanations. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | a sukka , which is a positive, time-bound mitzva, as it is written: “In sukkot you shall reside seven days” | Kiddushin 34a:9 | The Gemara further asks: <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of residing in <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which is a positive, time-bound mitzva, as it is written: “In <i>sukkot</i> you shall reside seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), referring to seven specific days of the year. Nevertheless, <b>the reason</b> women are exempt from this mitzva is <b>that the Merciful One writes</b> in the continuation of the verse: “All <b>the homeborn</b> in Israel shall reside in <i>sukkot</i>.” The definite article “the” is an exclusion, and serves <b>to exclude the women</b> from the obligation to reside in a <i>sukka</i>. It may be derived from here that <b>if that was not so, women</b> would be <b>obligated.</b> This indicates that women do not receive a blanket exemption from every positive, time-bound mitzva. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | one who sleeps in a sukka on the Eighth Day of Assembly should receive lashes | Rosh Hashanah28b:8 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the fulfillment of a mitzva does not require intent, <b>one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the Eighth Day of Assembly should receive lashes</b> for violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, since he is adding to the mitzva of: “You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42). Since, according to Rava, even if one did not intend to observe the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> but slept in the <i>sukka</i> for a different reason, his sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> constitutes the fulfillment of a mitzva to dwell there, then, if one did so at an inappropriate time, he is considered to have transgressed the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot. Yet the Sages instituted that in the Diaspora one must observe <i>Sukkot</i> for eight days. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | in sukkot ” | Sanhedrin 4a:12 | The Gemara explains: <b>The Rabbis hold that</b> the <b>tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses are written <b>is authoritative.</b> The Torah states: “You shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:42) spelled deficient, without the letter <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be read in the singular. And later in that verse it also states: “All that are homeborn in Israel shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>”</b> spelled the same way. And in the next verse it states: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i>,”</b> this time spelled plene, with a <i>vav</i>, which means it must be plural. Therefore, <b>there are four</b> walls <b>here. Remove one verse,</b> which is needed <b>to</b> teach the mitzva to sit in a <i>sukka</i> <b>itself,</b> and <b>three</b> walls <b>remain. The <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, which says that one of the walls may be incomplete, <b>comes</b> and <b>reduces the third and establishes it as</b> a minimum of one <b>handbreadth.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:42 | shall you reside” | Sukkah 27a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who mandates eating fourteen meals in the <i>sukka</i>? The Gemara answers that he derives his opinion from the verse: “In <i>sukkot</i> <b>shall you reside”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), which the Sages interpreted to mean: Reside <b>as you dwell</b> in your permanent home. Therefore, <b>just as</b> in one’s <b>dwelling</b> one typically eats <b>one</b> meal <b>during the day and one</b> meal <b>at night, so too, in a <i>sukka</i></b> one eats <b>one</b> meal <b>during the day and one</b> meal <b>at night.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:42 | a person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the Festival with the lulav of another, he fulfills his obligation with the sukka of another, as it is written: “All the homeborn in Israel shall reside in sukkot ” | Sukkah 27b:5 | <b>And the Rabbis say: Although they said</b> that <b>a person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the Festival with the <i>lulav</i> of another, he fulfills his obligation with the <i>sukka</i> of another, as it is written: “All the homeborn in Israel shall reside in <i>sukkot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:42). This <b>teaches that all of the Jewish people are fit to reside in one <i>sukka</i>.</b> If the value of one <i>sukka</i> were divided among all the Jewish people, no individual would have a <i>peruta</i> stake in it; therefore, no individual could be considered even a part-owner of the <i>sukka</i>. The only way the entire Jewish people could fulfill the mitzva in one <i>sukka</i> is by residing in a communal <i>sukka</i> that does not belong to any of them. Apparently, there is no obligation to reside specifically in one’s own <i>sukka</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | as the Sages taught | Sukkah 28a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that women, slaves, and minors are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated: “All the homeborn in Israel shall reside in <i>sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:42). Had the verse stated only: <b>Homeborn,</b> it would have been derived <b>that</b> any <b>homeborn</b> member of the Jewish people is obligated to observe this mitzva. However, the term with the addition of the definite article: <b>“The homeborn,”</b> indicates that only certain homeborn members are obligated, i.e., men, <b>to the exclusion of the women.</b> The word “all” in the phrase: <b>“All</b> the homeborn,” comes <b>to include the minors</b> capable of performing this mitzva. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | it might enter your mind to say: “Shall you reside” | Sukkah 28b:1 | <b>The verse equated a woman to a man</b> with regard <b>to all punishments</b> and prohibitions <b>in the Torah.</b> The mitzvot of Yom Kippur include prohibitions, as well as the punishment of <i>karet</i>. Why, then, was this additional derivation necessary? <b>Abaye said: Actually, <i>sukka</i> is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. Nevertheless, it <b>was necessary</b> to teach that a woman is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: “Shall you reside”</b> (Leviticus 23:42) indicates that you reside in the <i>sukka</i> <b>as you dwell; just as dwelling</b> is typically performed by a <b>man and his wife, so too,</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i></b> is performed by both <b>a man and his wife.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that women are exempt. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | from here: “In sukkot shall you reside seven days” | Sukkah 2a:12 | <b>Rava said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:42). <b>The Torah said:</b> For <b>the entire seven days, emerge from the permanent residence</b> in which you reside year round <b>and reside in a temporary residence,</b> the <i>sukka</i>. In constructing a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person</b> can <b>render his residence a temporary residence,</b> as up to that height one can construct a structure that is not sturdy; however, in constructing a <i>sukka</i> <b>above twenty cubits high, one cannot render his residence a temporary residence; rather,</b> he must construct a sturdy <b>permanent residence,</b> which is unfit for use as a <i>sukka</i>. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | also did not say | Sukkah 2b:4 | <b>They,</b> Rabba and Rabbi Zeira, <b>also did not say</b> that it is derived from the verse: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), <b>as did Rava, due to the difficulty</b> raised by <b>Abaye</b> with regard to a <i>sukka</i> with steel partitions. Since there is a weakness in each of the sources, it is understandable why the other Sages did not accept it. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | “You shall reside in sukkot | Sukkah 36b:10 | <b>And Rava</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>that fibers and the trunk of the date palm are the species of the <i>lulav</i>?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“You shall reside in <i>sukkot</i></b> for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), which means <b>a <i>sukka</i> of any material,</b> as the Torah was not particular about the material to be used for the roofing; any species may be used as long as it grew from the ground and it is not susceptible to impurity. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i> is practiced only with the four species of the <i>lulav</i></b> as roofing. <b>And,</b> he claims, <b>logic dictates</b> that it is so, as it is derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as</b> the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i>, which is not practiced at night as it is during the day, is practiced only with the four species,</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>, which is practiced at night as it is during the day, is it not right that its</b> roofing <b>should be only from the four species?</b> |
| Leviticus 23:42 | and the Torah states: “You shall reside in sukkot | Sukkah 37a:1 | According to your reasoning, if <b>one did not find</b> any of the <b>four species</b> to roof his <i>sukka</i>, <b>he will sit idly</b> and fail to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>; <b>and the Torah states: “You shall reside in <i>sukkot</i></b> for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), meaning <b>a <i>sukka</i> of any material. Likewise, in</b> the book of <b>Ezra,</b> which can refer also to the book of Nehemiah, <b>it says: “Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of a dense-leaved tree, to make <i>sukkot</i>, as it is written”</b> (Nehemiah 8:15). Apparently, a <i>sukka</i> may be constructed even with materials other than the four species. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | “You shall reside in sukkot for seven days” | Sukkah 43a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b><i>sukka</i> itself, from where do we</b> derive that the mitzva is observed at night as well? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“You shall reside in <i>sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), from which they derived: <b>Days and even nights.</b> The <i>tanna</i> continues the discussion: Do <b>you say days and even nights; or</b> perhaps the meaning <b>is only days and not nights? And it</b> may be inferred <b>logically</b> that the latter is correct. <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>: <b>“Days.” And it is stated with regard to <i>lulav</i>: “Days.” Just as there,</b> with regard to <i>lulav</i>, the meaning is <b>days and not nights, so too here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the meaning is <b>days and not nights.</b> That is one possibility. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | “You shall reside | Sukkah 43b:1 | <b>“You shall reside,” “you shall reside,”</b> by means <b>of a verbal analogy. It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>: <b>“You shall reside</b> in <i>sukkot</i> seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), <b>and it is stated with regard to the inauguration</b> of the Tabernacle: “And at the door of the Tent of Meeting <b>you shall reside</b> day and night seven days” (Leviticus 8:35). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the inauguration, the meaning is <b>days and even nights, so too here,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the meaning is <b>days and even nights.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:42 | in sukkot [ basukkot ]” | Sukkah 6b:9 | With regard to <i>sukka</i>, <b>the Rabbis hold: The tradition</b> of the verses <b>is authoritative,</b> as the word <i>basukkot</i> is written three times in the context of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. It is written twice in the verse: <b>“In <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]</b> shall you reside seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:42). In both of these instances, the word in Hebrew is spelled without a <i>vav</i>, as are Hebrew words in the singular. And one time it is written with a <i>vav</i>, as are Hebrew words in the plural: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:43). <b>There is</b> mention <b>here</b> of <i>sukka</i> <b>four</b> times, two singular plus one plural hinted at here in these verses. |
| Leviticus 23:42 | “In sukkot shall you reside” | Sukkah 9b:8 | § The mishna continues: If one established <b>a <i>sukka</i> atop</b> another <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> the upper <i>sukka</i> is fit and the lower <i>sukka</i> is unfit. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), <b>and not in a <i>sukka</i> that is beneath</b> another <b><i>sukka</i>, and not in <i>sukka</i> that is beneath a tree, and not in a <i>sukka</i> that is inside a house.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:43 | dwell in booths | Eruvin 3a:9 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak works out well if he does not hold this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba; however, if he holds this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba,</b> it is difficult. As <b>Rabba said</b> with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> whose roofing is higher than twenty cubits that <b>it is written: “In order that your generations should know that I made</b> the children of Israel <b>dwell in booths</b> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:43). When the roofing of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is aware that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>;</b> however, when the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is <b>above twenty cubits, a person is not aware</b> that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>because the eye does not discern</b> the <i>sukka</i> roofing. One does not usually raise his head to look that high, and consequently, he sees the walls and does not notice the defining feature of the <i>sukka</i>, its roofing. |
| Leviticus 23:43 | well according to the one who said | Sukkah 11b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that the <i>sukkot</i> mentioned in the verse: “I made the children of Israel to reside in <i>sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:43), <b>were clouds of glory,</b> as it is reasonable that the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is modeled after clouds. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the children of Israel <b>established for themselves actual <i>sukkot</i></b> in the desert, and the <i>sukkot</i> of today commemorate those, <b>what can be said?</b> According to that opinion, there is no connection between a <i>sukka</i> and a cloud. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“I made the children of Israel to reside in <i>sukkot</i>”;</b> these booths <b>were clouds of glory,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says: They established for themselves actual <i>sukkot</i>. This</b> works out <b>well according to Rabbi Eliezer; however, according to Rabbi Akiva what can be said?</b> |
| Leviticus 23:43 | as the verse states: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside in sukkot | Sukkah 2a:8 | <b>Rabba said</b> that it is derived <b>as the verse states: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside in <i>sukkot</i></b> when I took them out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 23:43). In a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, even without a concerted effort, <b>a person is aware that he is residing in a <i>sukka</i>.</b> His eye catches sight of the roofing, evoking the <i>sukka</i> and its associated mitzvot. However, in a <i>sukka</i> that is <b>more than twenty cubits high, a person is not aware that he is residing in a <i>sukka</i> because his eye does not</b> involuntarily <b>catch sight</b> of the roof, as at that height, without a concerted effort one would not notice the roofing. |
| Leviticus 23:43 | did not say | Sukkah 2b:1 | The Gemara explains why each of the Sages cited his own source and did not accept the sources cited by the others. <b>All of them,</b> Rabbi Zeira and Rava, <b>did not say</b> that the fact that a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high is unfit is derived from the verse: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside in <i>sukkot</i> when I took them out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 23:43), <b>as</b> did <b>Rabba,</b> because in their opinion <b>that</b> verse does not mandate one to be aware that he is sitting in a <i>sukka</i>; rather, it mandates <b>knowledge for</b> future <b>generations</b> of the exodus from Egypt. |
| Leviticus 23:43 | in sukkot [ basukkot ]” | Sukkah 6b:9 | With regard to <i>sukka</i>, <b>the Rabbis hold: The tradition</b> of the verses <b>is authoritative,</b> as the word <i>basukkot</i> is written three times in the context of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. It is written twice in the verse: <b>“In <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]</b> shall you reside seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:42). In both of these instances, the word in Hebrew is spelled without a <i>vav</i>, as are Hebrew words in the singular. And one time it is written with a <i>vav</i>, as are Hebrew words in the plural: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:43). <b>There is</b> mention <b>here</b> of <i>sukka</i> <b>four</b> times, two singular plus one plural hinted at here in these verses. |
| Leviticus 23:44 | “And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord” | Bava Batra120b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Beit Shammai, who do not have</b> this <b>verbal analogy,</b> meaning that they do not recognize as authoritative the verbal analogy that links vows to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, <b>from where do they</b> derive that <b>dissolution of vows</b> can be performed <b>by three laymen?</b> The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>derive it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states at the end of a passage relating to the <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals: <b>“And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). In explaining the verse, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> |
| Leviticus 23:44 | is stated: “And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord” | Megillah 31a:3 | On Festivals and holidays, they read a portion relating to the character of the day, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44), which indicates that part of <b>the mitzva</b> of the Festivals is <b>that</b> the people <b>should read</b> the portion relating to them, <b>each one in its</b> appointed <b>time.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:44 | “And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord” | Megillah 32a:17 | § The mishna states: The verse <b>“And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44) indicates that part of <b>the mitzva</b> of the Festivals is <b>that they should read</b> the portion relating to them, <b>each one in its</b> appointed <b>time. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses enacted for the Jewish people that they should make</b> halakhic <b>inquiries and expound upon the matter of the day.</b> They should occupy themselves with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover on Passover,</b> with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Shavuot</i> on <i>Shavuot</i>, and</b> with the <b><i>halakhot</i> of <i>Sukkot</i> on <i>Sukkot</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:44 | “And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord | Menachot 72b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to reaping,</b> does it <b>not</b> override Shabbat, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As, isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi said the following <i>halakha</i> based upon the verse: <b>“And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord</b> to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 23:44): <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this phrase? This phrase is necessary <b>because we</b> had <b>learned only that the daily offering and the Paschal offering</b> override Shabbat and ritual impurity, <b>as it is stated concerning them: “In its appointed time”</b> (see Numbers 9:2, 28:2), from which it is derived that each of them must be sacrificed <b>in its appointed time and even on Shabbat; in its appointed time and even in ritual impurity.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:44 | as it is written: “And Moses declared the Festivals of the Lord to the children of Israel” | Nedarim 78a:9 | This is <b>as it is written: “And Moses declared the Festivals of the Lord to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The Festivals are stated, but Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, is not stated with them. Ben Azzai says: The Festivals are stated, but the portion on vows is not stated with them.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:44 | “And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord | Pesachim 77a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all of them come from,</b> i.e., are derived from, the term <b>appointed time? From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> based upon the verse: <b>“And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord</b> to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 23:44). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this phrase? This phrase is necessary <b>because we</b> had <b>learned only that the daily offering and the Paschal lamb</b> override Shabbat and ritual impurity, <b>as it is stated with regard to them: In its appointed time,</b> from which it is derived that each of them must be sacrificed <b>in its appointed time and even on Shabbat, in its appointed time and even in ritual impurity.</b> |
| Leviticus 23:44 | the appointed seasons of the Lord” | Rosh Hashanah24a:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>the head of the court</b> says: It is sanctified. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the court must sanctify the New Moon, derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And Moses declared</b> to the children of Israel <b>the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the head of the court says:</b> It is <b>sanctified,</b> as it is evident from the verse that Moses, whose status was equivalent to that of the head of the Great Sanhedrin, declared the appointed times of the Festivals and New Moons in a formal manner. |
| Leviticus 24:2 | the Candelabrum, | Menachot 86a:11 | <b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum,</b> which requires: “Refined olive oil” (Leviticus 24:2), <b>and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:2 | for illumination” | Menachot 86a:29 | <b>Also,</b> with regard to <b>all the meal offerings, it was logical that they should require</b> the highest quality of <b>refined olive oil,</b> just like the Candelabrum. Because <b>if</b> the <b>Candelabrum, whose</b> oil <b>is not to be consumed</b> on the altar, <b>requires refined olive oil,</b> then <b>meal offerings, which</b> are <b>to be consumed</b> on the altar, <b>is it not logical that they should require refined olive oil?</b> To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states: “Refined pounded</b> olive oil <b>for illumination”</b> (Leviticus 24:2), which indicates that the high-quality, refined, pounded oil is required for the Candelabrum, <b>but there is no</b> need for <b>refined pounded</b> olive oil <b>for meal offerings.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:2 | all the meal offerings, it was logical | Menachot 86b:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Also</b> with regard to <b>all the meal offerings, it was logical</b> that they should require refined olive oil. To dispel this notion, the verse states: “Refined pounded olive oil for illumination” (Leviticus 24:2). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse cited in the mishna: The word <b>“refined”</b> means <b>nothing other than clean</b> oil, which flows by itself from the olives without applying any pressure. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the word <b>“pounded”</b> means <b>nothing other than</b> olives <b>crushed</b> with a mortar, but not with a millstone. |
| Leviticus 24:2 | “Command the children of Israel, and they shall take for yourself refined pounded olive oil | Menachot 86b:5 | § The Gemara discusses the Candelabrum and other aspects of the Temple. The verse states: <b>“Command the children of Israel, and they shall take for yourself refined pounded olive oil</b> for illumination, to kindle the lamps continually” (Leviticus 24:2). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> God tells the Jewish people that the oil should be taken <b>“for yourself,”</b> to indicate that it is for their benefit <b>and not for My</b> benefit, as <b>I do not need its light.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:3 | “Outside the Curtain of the testimony in the Tent of Meeting” | Menachot 86b:8 | God instructed Aaron to kindle the Candelabrum: <b>“Outside the Curtain of the testimony in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 24:3). The dividing curtain is referred to here as: The Curtain of the testimony, to indicate that the illumination of the Candelabrum <b>is testimony to all of humanity that the Divine Presence rests among the Jewish people.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:3 | before the Lord | Menachot 98b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>Candelabrum itself, from where do we</b> derive that it was positioned from east to west? This is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written with regard to the western lamp</b> of the Candelabrum: “Outside the Curtain of the testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, <b>Aaron shall set it in order,</b> to burn from evening to morning <b>before the Lord</b> continually” (Leviticus 24:3). The phrase “shall set it in order” is written in the singular, referring only to the western lamp. |
| Leviticus 24:3 | order | Shabbat 22b:2 | <b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. With regard to the Temple candelabrum, it is stated: <b>“Outside the veil of the testimony,</b> in the Tent of Meeting, <b>shall</b> Aaron <b>order</b> it from evening to morning before the Lord continually; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations” (Leviticus 24:3). It must be understood: <b>And does</b> God <b>require its light</b> for illumination at night? <b>Didn’t the children of Israel, all forty years that they walked in the wilderness, walk exclusively by His light,</b> the pillar of fire? <b>Rather,</b> the lighting of the candelabrum <b>is testimony to mankind that the Divine Presence rests among Israel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>testimony? Rav said: That is the westernmost lamp</b> in the candelabrum <b>in which the measure of oil placed was the same measure</b> of oil as was placed in <b>the other</b> lamps, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>he would light the</b> others <b>from it</b> each day <b>and with it he would conclude,</b> i.e., the westernmost lamp would continue burning throughout the day after all the others were extinguished. The rest of the lamps burned only at night, and each night he would relight the rest of the lamps from the westernmost lamp. <b>But isn’t it true that here,</b> in the Temple, <b>since the lamps were fixed</b> in the candelabrum, it was impossible to light directly from lamp to lamp? <b>There was no alternative to taking</b> a wood chip <b>and lighting</b> the rest of the lamps from the westernmost lamp. Consequently, <b>it is difficult both according to the one who said</b> that one may not light from lamp to lamp <b>due to contempt for the mitzva and according to the one who said</b> that one may not light from lamp to lamp <b>due to weakening</b> the <b>mitzva.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:4 | which is written: “Upon the pure Candelabrum” | Menachot 29a:8 | § <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Upon the pure Candelabrum”</b> (Leviticus 24:4)? It teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it descended,</b> i.e., was shown to Moses, <b>from the place of purity,</b> i.e., by God, who showed Moses a model of the Candelabrum. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> is that to say that phrase <b>“upon the pure Table”</b> (Leviticus 24:6) also teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it</b> was shown to Moses <b>from the place of purity? Rather,</b> the expression “the <b>pure</b> Table” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure. Here too,</b> the expression “the <b>pure</b> Candelabrum” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:5 | the shewbread, it is written explicitly of it: | Menachot 76a:4 | § The mishna teaches that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>all of the meal offerings come</b> as ten loaves or wafers, except for the shewbread and the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which come as <b>twelve</b> loaves or wafers. The Gemara examines the sources for these exceptions: With regard to <b>the shewbread, it is written explicitly of it:</b> “And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes of it” (Leviticus 24:5). |
| Leviticus 24:5 | as it is stated: “And you shall take fine flour and bake it” | Menachot 76b:9 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The flour of <b>the <i>omer</i> was sifted with thirteen sifters,</b> each finer than its predecessor, and the flour that emerged from the final sifter was sacrificed. The flour of <b>the two loaves</b> was sifted <b>with twelve</b> sifters, <b>and</b> the flour of <b>the shewbread</b> was sifted <b>with eleven</b> sifters. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They have no fixed</b> number of sifters; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>fine flour</b> that was <b>completely sifted</b> that <b>one would bring</b> for all of these offerings, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall take fine flour and bake it”</b> (Leviticus 24:5), indicating that one does not fulfill his obligation <b>until</b> the flour <b>will be completely sifted.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:6 | upon the pure table” | Chagigah 26b:6 | The Gemara answers: The table <b>too is</b> in fact <b>carried full and empty, in accordance with</b> the words <b>of Reish Lakish. For Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, <b>upon the pure table”</b> (Leviticus 24:6)? The words “pure table” teach <b>by inference that it is</b> capable of becoming <b>impure,</b> and therefore the Torah warns us to make sure it is pure when the twelve loaves of bread are placed there. |
| Leviticus 24:6 | “upon the pure Table” | Menachot 29a:8 | § <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Upon the pure Candelabrum”</b> (Leviticus 24:4)? It teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it descended,</b> i.e., was shown to Moses, <b>from the place of purity,</b> i.e., by God, who showed Moses a model of the Candelabrum. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> is that to say that phrase <b>“upon the pure Table”</b> (Leviticus 24:6) also teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it</b> was shown to Moses <b>from the place of purity? Rather,</b> the expression “the <b>pure</b> Table” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure. Here too,</b> the expression “the <b>pure</b> Candelabrum” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:6 | which is written: “Upon the pure Table” | Menachot 29a:9 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>Granted,</b> the inference drawn <b>there</b> with regard to the Table is <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Reish Lakish</b> says; <b>as Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Upon the pure Table”</b> (Leviticus 24:6)? The expression “pure Table” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure,</b> but why? Isn’t the Table <b>a wooden vessel designated to rest</b> in a fixed place, <b>and any wooden vessel that is designated to rest</b> in a fixed place <b>is not susceptible to</b> becoming <b>ritually impure? Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that</b> the Table was not always left in a fixed place; the priests would <b>lift</b> the Table with its shewbread <b>to display the shewbread to the pilgrims</b> standing in the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> a priest would <b>say to them: See your affection before the Omnipresent.</b> For this reason, the Table is susceptible to becoming ritually impure. |
| Leviticus 24:6 | “And you shall set them” | Menachot 94a:15 | § The mishna teaches that the shewbread was placed in a mold, and with regard to this <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall set them”</b> (Leviticus 24:6), which means to set them <b>in a mold. There are three molds</b> that are used in the Temple in the preparation of the loaves. First, the baker <b>places</b> the shewbread <b>in a mold</b> while <b>it is still dough. And</b> second, <b>there was a type of mold for</b> the shewbread <b>in the oven,</b> in which the loaves were baked. <b>And when he removes [<i>rodah</i>]</b> the shewbread from the oven, <b>he places it in</b> a third <b>mold so that its</b> shape <b>will not be ruined.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is a third mold necessary? <b>Let him return</b> the shewbread <b>to the first mold,</b> in which the dough was kneaded. The Gemara answers: <b>Once</b> the dough <b>is baked, it rises,</b> and no longer fits into the first mold. |
| Leviticus 24:6 | upon the pure Table | Menachot 96b:8 | The Gemara answers: The <b>Table is also carried</b> both <b>full and empty,</b> i.e., even when the shewbread is upon it, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish.</b> This is <b>as Reish Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall set them in two arrangements, six in an arrangement, <b>upon the pure Table</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 24:6)? The term “the <b>pure</b> Table” teaches <b>by inference that there is</b> a case where the Table becomes <b>impure,</b> and therefore the Torah states that the Table must be pure when the shewbread is set upon it. This conclusion is difficult, as the principle that a wooden vessel designated to rest in a fixed place is not susceptible to impurity indicates that the Table should not be susceptible to impurity. |
| Leviticus 24:6 | on the pure table | Yoma 21a:9 | The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> <b>counts miracles that</b> were performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary and were visible to all, but he <b>does not count miracles that</b> were performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary and were not visible to all. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the shewbread is also a miracle</b> performed on the table <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary and is not visible to all, yet the miracle that the bread’s heat did not dissipate was listed among the miracles. The Gemara answers: <b>The shewbread was a miracle</b> performed <b>outside, as Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Place them <b>on the pure table</b> before the Lord in two rows, six to a row” (Leviticus 24:6)? From the emphasis that the Torah places on the fact that the table was ritually <b>pure,</b> it can be learned <b>by inference that it indicates that it</b> could become <b>impure</b> as well. |
| Leviticus 24:7 | “And you shall put pure frankincense upon [ al ] each row” | Menachot 62a:13 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the shewbread, the verse states: <b>“And you shall put pure frankincense upon [<i>al</i>] each row”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: <i>Al</i></b> in this instance means: <b>Next to.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means: <b>Next to? Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> means <b>only actually upon?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>When it says:</b> “And you shall put there the Ark of the Testimony, <b>and you shall place a cover over [al] the Ark with the Curtain”</b> (Exodus 40:3), the word <i>al</i> cannot mean upon, as the Curtain that separated the Sanctuary from the Holy of Holies was hanging near the Ark, not placed on top of it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means <b>next to.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:7 | with regard to the shewbread: “Bread” | Menachot 77b:9 | <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and derive the <i>halakha</i> from a different verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“Bread,” and it is stated</b> there, <b>with regard to the shewbread: “Bread”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). One can conclude that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the shewbread, each of the twelve loaves is baked from <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah flour, <b>so too here,</b> each of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering should be baked from <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour. |
| Leviticus 24:7 | said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall place pure frankincense upon [ al ] each arrangement, | Menachot 96a:11 | <b>Abba Shaul says: There,</b> in the space between the two arrangements, the priests <b>would place</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense that</b> accompany <b>the shewbread.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall place pure frankincense upon [<i>al</i>] each arrangement,</b> that it may be for the bread as a memorial part, an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 24:7)? The verse indicates that the frankincense is placed upon the shewbread and not next to it. Abba Shaul <b>said to</b> the Sages in response: <b>Isn’t it already stated: “And next to him [<i>alav</i>] shall be the tribe of Manasseh”</b> (Numbers 2:20)? Just as the preposition “<i>alav</i>” in this verse means that the tribe of Manasseh pitched camp next to the tribe of Ephraim and not upon it, so too, the preposition “<i>al</i>” means that the frankincense was placed next to the arrangements of the shewbread. |
| Leviticus 24:7 | upon [ al ] | Menachot 98a:18 | <b>How</b> are <b>these</b> arrangements actually set on the Table? The priest <b>places</b> on the Table <b>two arrangements of six</b> loaves <b>each. And if he placed one</b> arrangement <b>of four</b> loaves <b>and one</b> arrangement <b>of eight</b> loaves <b>he has not fulfilled</b> the obligation. If he added two loaves, so that there were <b>two</b> arrangements <b>of seven</b> loaves <b>each, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One views the upper</b> loaf of each arrangement <b>as though it is not</b> there, and he has fulfilled the obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we require</b> that the frankincense be placed upon the shewbread, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall place</b> pure frankincense <b>upon [<i>al</i>]</b> each arrangement, that it may be for the bread as a memorial part” (Leviticus 24:7)? If the priest places an additional, non-sacred loaf upon the arrangement, it interposes between the frankincense and the shewbread. |
| Leviticus 24:7 | “And you shall place pure frankincense by [ al ] each arrangement” | Menachot 98a:19 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Hamnuna, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that the word <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means that the frankincense is <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall place pure frankincense by [<i>al</i>] each arrangement”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). The preposition <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> in this verse means that the frankincense is <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread. <b>Do you say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread, <b>or</b> perhaps it means <b>nothing other than</b> that the frankincense was <b>literally upon</b> the shewbread? <b>When it says: “And you shall place the Curtain as a screen next to [<i>al</i>] the Ark”</b> (Exodus 40:3), it is evident that “<i>al</i>” does not mean upon the Ark, as the Curtain separating the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was hung in front of the Ark and not placed on top of it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that the word <b><i>al</i></b> can also mean <b>adjacent to.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:7 | “And you shall put pure frankincense on [ al ] each row” | Sotah 37a:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the shewbread: <b>“And you shall put pure frankincense on [<i>al</i>] each row”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: “<i>Al</i>”</b> in this instance means <b>adjacent to.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to, or</b> perhaps it carries <b>only</b> its <b>literal</b> meaning of <b>“on”? When it says</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall screen the Ark [<i>al haAron</i>]</b> with the curtain” (Exodus 40:3), the word “<i>al</i>” cannot mean on, as the curtain that separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was not placed on top of the Ark, but near it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:8 | before the Lord continually” | Megillah 21a:6 | <b>And,</b> according to Rabbi Yosei, <b>how do I uphold</b> that which is written with regard to the shewbread: “He shall set it in order <b>before the Lord continually”</b> (Leviticus 24:8), implying that the bread must be on the table at all times? It means only <b>that the table should not be</b> an entire day <b>without the bread,</b> but if there is bread on the table for even a part of the day, it is considered as being there “continually.” |
| Leviticus 24:8 | it states: “It is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant” | Menachot 21b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states: “It is an everlasting covenant of salt”</b> (Numbers 18:19), <b>and there,</b> with regard to the shewbread, <b>it states: “It is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant”</b> (Leviticus 24:8); Therefore, <b>just as</b> the phrase written <b>there:</b> “From the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant,” means that it is brought <b>from communal</b> supplies, as the shewbread is a communal offering, <b>so too here,</b> the verse that speaks of the everlasting covenant of salt means that the salt is brought <b>from communal</b> supplies. Evidently, salt is provided for offerings of Israelites, and should likewise be provided for the offerings of priests. Accordingly, there would have been no need for the court to permit the priests to salt their offerings, and it must be that the ordinance of the court permitted the priests to use salt when eating sacrificial foods. |
| Leviticus 24:8 | day” | Yoma 34a:5 | <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>reasonable</b> that the sequence should be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said the additional offerings</b> precede <b>the vessels</b> of frankincense, as <b>didn’t you say</b> that the repetition of the term: <b>In the morning, in the morning,</b> comes <b>to prioritize</b> the daily offering? <b>Here too,</b> repetition within the clause: “He shall arrange them <b>on</b> Shabbat <b>day, on</b> Shabbat <b>day”</b> (Leviticus 24:8), with regard to the vessels of frankincense, comes to <b>postpone</b> that service until the peak of the day. |
| Leviticus 24:9 | “And it shall be for Aaron and his sons” | Bava Batra143a:10 | § The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to his wife: My property is given to you and to your sons. Rav Yosef says:</b> In such a case, the wife <b>acquires half</b> of the property, even though the man did not specify how much of his property he was giving her. <b>And Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states with regard to the shewbread: <b>“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). This means <b>half for Aaron</b> and <b>half for his sons.</b> One can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that when it is specified that a gift is to be divided between an individual and a group, the intention is that the individual receives half. |
| Leviticus 24:9 | “It is most holy” | Menachot 12b:7 | <b>Rava then said: That</b> which <b>I said,</b> that the burning of the handful with the intent to consume the remainder the next day is effective in rendering even a remainder that became lacking in measure as <i>piggul</i> and to remove it from being subject to misuse of consecrated property <b>is nothing, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the shewbread: <b>“It is most holy”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). The restrictive term “it” teaches that the shewbread must remain whole, so <b>that if one of</b> the loaves of the shewbread <b>broke</b> and consequently became lacking in measure, then <b>all of its loaves are disqualified,</b> and the burning of the bowls of frankincense do not render them permitted for consumption. |
| Leviticus 24:9 | statute is written, it is written with regard to the eating | Menachot 19a:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of <b>the shewbread, where when</b> the term <b>statute is written, it is written with regard to the eating</b> of the shewbread, as the verse states: “And they shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, a perpetual statute” (Leviticus 24:9), <b>and we learn</b> in the mishna (27a): With regard to <b>the two arrangements</b> of the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the arrangements <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the arrangements <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>and the bowls</b> of frankincense, failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:9 | obligation” | Menachot 76a:5 | That the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest</b> is also offered as twelve units is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the word “obligation,” written in the context of the verse discussing the <b>shewbread.</b> With regard to the griddle-cake offering, the verse states: “And the anointed priest…shall offer it; it is an <b>obligation</b> forever” (Leviticus 6:15), and the verse states with regard to the twelve loaves of the shewbread: “And it shall be for Aaron and his sons…a perpetual <b>obligation”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). |
| Leviticus 24:9 | “And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, | Sanhedrin 21a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Tzadok himself, from where do we</b> derive that the High Priest takes half? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The Torah states with regard to the apportionment of the shewbread: <b>“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons,</b> and they shall eat it in a holy place” (Leviticus 24:9), from which it is inferred: <b>Half for Aaron and half for his sons.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:9 | as it is stated: “It shall be for Aaron and his sons | Yoma 17b:4 | <b>How does</b> the High Priest <b>take</b> any <b>portion</b> that he chooses <b>first?</b> The High Priest <b>says: This sin-offering, I am eating,</b> or: <b>This guilt-offering, I am eating. And he</b> may even <b>take</b> one <b>loaf</b> of the <b>two loaves</b> offered on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>. He may take <b>four or five</b> of the twelve <b>shewbread loaves</b> that are distributed to the priests every Shabbat. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The High Priest <b>always</b> takes <b>five</b> of the twelve shewbread loaves, <b>as it is stated: “It shall be for Aaron and his sons</b> and they shall eat it in a sacred place” (Leviticus 24:9). From the fact that Aaron and his sons are listed separately, it is derived that <b>half</b> of the loaves were given <b>to Aaron,</b> or the High Priests who succeeded him, <b>and half</b> were given <b>to his sons.</b> Since, as explained below, only ten of the loaves were actually distributed, the High Priest received five. |
| Leviticus 24:9 | he derives: Statute, | Yoma 34a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of the one who said:</b> The <b>vessels</b> of frankincense <b>precede the additional offerings?</b> The Gemara explains: By means of a verbal analogy <b>he derives: Statute,</b> written with regard to the vessels of frankincense: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 24:9), <b>from: Statute,</b> written with regard to the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 6:15). Just as the griddle-cake offering precedes the additional offerings, so too, the vessels of frankincense precede the additional offerings. |
| Leviticus 24:11 | and cursed” | Sanhedrin 56a:12 | The Gemara presents an alternative proof that <i>nokev</i> is referring to cursing: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the verse states: “And</b> the son of the Israelite woman <b>blasphemed [<i>vayyikkov</i>]</b> the name <b>and cursed”</b> (Leviticus 24:11). <b>That is to say that</b> the meaning of <b><i>nokev</i> is</b> to <b>curse.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:12 | that it might be declared to them according to the Lord” | Sanhedrin 78b:7 | The difference between the uncertainty in the case of the wood gatherer and the uncertainty in the case of the blasphemer is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses our teacher knew that the</b> wood <b>gatherer</b> was liable to be sentenced <b>to death, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall observe the Shabbat as it is sacred to you; <b>one who desecrates it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14). <b>But he did not know with which death</b> penalty <b>he was</b> to be <b>killed, as it is stated:</b> “And they placed him under guard, <b>as it had not been declared</b> what should be done to him” (Numbers 15:34). <b>But</b> concerning the <b>blasphemer it is stated only:</b> “And they placed him under guard <b>that it might be declared to them according to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 24:12), <b>as Moses did not know if</b> the blasphemer <b>was liable to be killed at all, or not.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:14 | “Take out him who has cursed | Sanhedrin 42b:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> When <b>the trial has ended</b> in a guilty verdict and the condemned man has been sentenced to be stoned, <b>he is taken out to be stoned. The place of stoning was outside the court</b> and a little beyond it, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to a blasphemer: <b>“Take out him who has cursed</b> to outside the camp, and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him” (Leviticus 24:14). |
| Leviticus 24:14 | “Take out him who has cursed to outside the camp” | Sanhedrin 42b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that the stoning is carried out outside the three camps? <b>As the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Take out him who has cursed to outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 24:14). This means: <b>Outside</b> the <b>three camps,</b> i.e., even outside the camp of the Israelites. Do <b>you say</b> that he is taken <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, or</b> is he perhaps taken <b>outside only one camp?</b> Proof is brought that he must be taken outside the three camps: <b>It is stated here</b> that the condemned man is taken <b>“outside the camp” and it is stated with regard to the bulls</b> brought as sin-offerings <b>that are burned</b> that they must be burned <b>“outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). <b>Just as there,</b> the bulls brought as sin-offerings are burned when <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, so too here,</b> the condemned man is taken <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:14 | In the Levite camp. And the Merciful One said to him: “Take out him who has cursed” | Sanhedrin 43a:5 | <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The location of the place of stoning can be directly derived from the verse discussing the blasphemer but in a slightly different manner. <b>Where was Moses sitting</b> when the matter of the blasphemer was brought before him? <b>In the Levite camp. And the Merciful One said to him: “Take out him who has cursed”</b> (Leviticus 24:14), indicating that he should be taken <b>outside the Levite camp</b> into the Israelite camp. And God continued in that verse: <b>“Outside the camp,”</b> which is an additional command that he should be removed even further, to <b>outside the Israelite camp.</b> And the later verse, which says: <b>“And they brought him that had cursed</b> out of the camp…and the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses” (Leviticus 24:23), teaches us <b>about the implementation</b> of God’s instructions, i.e., that the children of Israel did in fact carry out His command. |
| Leviticus 24:14 | hands | Sanhedrin 43a:6 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>The implementation</b> of God’s instructions is <b>written explicitly in this</b> context, as it is stated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.”</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to teach us that not only was the condemned man taken outside the three camps and stoned, but the rest of God’s instructions were also fulfilled. These instructions relate <b>to the placing</b> of the witnesses’ <b>hands</b> upon the head of the condemned man, as it is stated: “And let all that heard him place their hands upon his head” (Leviticus 24:14), <b>and to the</b> witnesses’ <b>pushing</b> of the condemned man from a platform the height of two stories. |
| Leviticus 24:14 | shall stone him” | Sanhedrin 45a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> behind the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who say that a man is stoned naked, but a woman is not? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “And</b> all the congregation <b>shall stone him”</b> (Leviticus 24:14). <b>What</b> does the verse intend to teach when it emphasizes that they stone <b>“him”?</b> |
| Leviticus 24:14 | not enter your mind, as it is written: “Bring forth the one who cursed… | Sanhedrin 56a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> this verse does not prove that the meaning of <i>nokev</i> is to curse; rather, it indicates that one is not liable to be executed <b>unless he does both,</b> i.e., both <i>nokev</i> and cursing God? The Gemara answers: This shall <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Bring forth the one who cursed…</b>and stone him” (Leviticus 24:14), <b>and it is not written: Bring forth the <i>nokev</i> and one who cursed. Conclude from it</b> that <b>it is one</b> act and not two. |
| Leviticus 24:14 | stone him” | Sotah 23b:10 | § The mishna states: <b>A man is stoned naked,</b> but a woman is not stoned naked. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: The verse states: <b>“And</b> let the entire congregation <b>stone him”</b> (Leviticus 24:14). <b>What</b> does the term <b>“him”</b> come to exclude? <b>If we say</b> this means that they stone <b>him but not her,</b> i.e., that a woman is not stoned at all, <b>but isn’t it written: “And you shall take out that man or that woman,</b> who did this evil thing, to your gates, that man or that woman; and you shall stone them with stones, and they shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). <b>Rather,</b> the term <b>“him”</b> excludes his garment, indicating that he is stoned <b>without his garment. And</b> a woman is excluded from this <i>halakha</i>, as one may infer from the term “him” that they do <b>not</b> stone <b>her without her garment.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:15 | this verse: “Any man [ ish , ish ] who curses his God” | Chagigah 11b:11 | They ask: <b>If that is so,</b> then what of <b>this verse: “Any man [<i>ish</i>, <i>ish</i>] who curses his God”</b> (Leviticus 24:15), or <b>“Any man [<i>ish</i>, <i>ish</i>] who gives of his seed to the <i>Molekh</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:2), which is a form of idol worship? In both cases the double expression implies the number two. <b>So too</b> there, will you say that it is prohibited to teach these <i>halakhot</i> before two individuals? |
| Leviticus 24:15 | shall bear his sin” | Keritot 7a:25 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): One who unwittingly <b>blasphemes brings an offering, since <i>karet</i> is stated with regard to it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15), as the Gemara will explain. The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> an established <b>principle</b> that <b>wherever it is written <i>karet</i> with regard to</b> a mitzva, one who violates it unwittingly <b>brings an offering? But there</b> is the case of the mitzva of the <b>Paschal offering, and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, as</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> is written</b> for failing to perform <b>them, and</b> yet <b>one does not bring an offering</b> for failing to perform these mitzvot unwittingly. |
| Leviticus 24:15 | shall bear his sin” | Keritot 7b:2 | The Gemara analyzes the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). The Gemara explains: Here we <b>arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Akiva is saying to the Rabbis: You say</b> that the transgression of one who <b>blasphemes does not involve an action,</b> as <b>what is</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes?</b> It is one who <b>blesses,</b> i.e., curses, <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God. <b>But</b> if so, then concerning the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that is written:</b> “That person blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off [<i>venikhreta</i>] from among his people” (Numbers 15:30), <b>for what</b> purpose <b>does it come,</b> if not to render him liable to bring an offering? |
| Leviticus 24:15 | karet to one who curses | Keritot 7b:3 | The Rabbis <b>say to him:</b> It comes <b>to give</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> to one who curses</b> God, in order to teach that the phrase: “Shall bear his sin,” written in the verse: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin” (Leviticus 24:15), is referring to <i>karet</i>, so that one can derive by verbal analogy that an individual who was obligated to bring a Paschal offering for the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> and did not do so is likewise liable to receive <i>karet</i>. <b>As it is written with regard to one who curses</b> God: “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin,” and it is written with regard to</b> one who was obligated to bring a Paschal offering for the <b>second <i>Pesaḥ</i></b> and did not do so: “That man <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Numbers 9:13). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to one who curses God it is referring to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, so too here,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering it is referring to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:15 | and it is stated: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin” | Kiddushin 30b:20 | Likewise, <b>it is stated: “He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:17), <b>and it is stated: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>The verse equates the blessing,</b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>of</b> one’s <b>father and mother to the blessing of the Omnipresent. But with regard to striking,</b> i.e., with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one who strikes his father or mother is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>it is certainly not possible</b> to say the same concerning the Holy One, Blessed be He. |
| Leviticus 24:15 | shall bear his sin” | Pesachim 93b:1 | <b>He holds</b> that with regard to the case of the <b>blasphemer</b> mentioned in the verse: “That person blasphemes the Lord and that soul shall be cut off [<i>karet</i>] from among his people” (Numbers 15:30), <b>this is</b> identical to the case of <b>one who blesses the name</b> of God, a euphemism for cursing God’s name. <b>And it is written with regard to one who blesses the name</b> of God: “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). Therefore, the punishment of <i>karet</i> applies to a sin about which the Torah states: Shall bear his sin. |
| Leviticus 24:15 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 56a:14 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin” (Leviticus 24:15), that the verse could have stated: <b>One [<i>ish</i>]</b> who curses his God. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Anyone [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> It is <b>to include the gentiles, who are prohibited from blessing,</b> i.e., cursing, <b>the name</b> of God, just <b>like Jews</b> are. <b>And they are executed</b> for this transgression <b>by the sword alone, as all death</b> penalties <b>stated with regard to the descendants of Noah are by the sword alone.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:15 | “anyone” | Sanhedrin 57a:10 | <b>If</b> they <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> the punishment for <b>bloodshed</b> by means of an analogy, then descendants of Noah should be executed <b>even</b> if they transgressed <b>any of</b> the other Noahide mitzvot. <b>If</b> they are executed <b>because they are included in</b> the term <b>“anyone”</b> and similarly, the term “no one” stated with regard to these two prohibitions, as it is stated with regard to cursing the name of God: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin” (Leviticus 24:15), and it is stated with regard to forbidden sexual relations: “No one shall approach any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness” (Leviticus 18:6), then gentiles should be executed for <b>idol worship too,</b> as <b>they are included in</b> the term <b>“anyone”</b> stated in that context (see Leviticus 20:2). |
| Leviticus 24:15 | “Each and every man who shall curse his God shall bear his sin” | Shevuot 36a:16 | <b>The Sages taught</b> that it is written: <b>“Each and every man who shall curse his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16)? One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one would be liable only for</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God <b>alone. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> liability for one who curses <b>the appellations</b> of God? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Each and every man who shall curse his God,”</b> indicating that one is liable <b>in any case,</b> even for cursing an appellation. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. The Rabbis say: For</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God, one is liable to be executed <b>with</b> a court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated explicitly in the verse. <b>And for</b> cursing one of the <b>appellations</b> of God, one is liable <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition,</b> but he is not liable to be executed. |
| Leviticus 24:16 | the verse state: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin”? But isn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 56a:17 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin”? But isn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16)? Rather, <b>since it is stated: “And he who blasphemes the name</b> of the Lord <b>shall be put to death,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>will be liable only for</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse <b>includes</b> one who curses <b>any of the appellations</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “Anyone who curses his God,”</b> to indicate that one is liable to be executed <b>in any case.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:16 | because the verse states: “The convert as well as the homeborn, | Sanhedrin 56a:20 | <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the verse states: “The convert as well as the homeborn,</b> when he blasphemes the name, he shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:16), from which it is derived that <b>it is</b> only in the case of <b>a convert or a homeborn</b> Jew <b>that we require</b> the condition: <b>“When he blasphemes the name,”</b> i.e., he is liable to be executed only if he curses the ineffable name. <b>But a gentile</b> is liable to be executed <b>even due to</b> merely cursing <b>an appellation.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:16 | when he blasphemes [ benokvo ] the name, he shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 56a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “And he who blasphemes [<i>venokev</i>] the name</b> of the Lord shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him; the convert as well as the homeborn, <b>when he blasphemes [<i>benokvo</i>] the name, he shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). It is derived from the repetition of the phrase “blasphemes the name” that the reference is to cursing the name of God with the name of God. |
| Leviticus 24:16 | “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord…shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 56b:6 | With regard to the term <b>“the Lord,” this</b> alludes to <b>blessing the name</b> of God; <b>and so it states</b> in another verse: <b>“And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord…shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). <b>“God,” this</b> alludes to <b>idol worship; and so it states: “You shall have no other gods</b> before Me” (Exodus 20:2). <b>“The man,” this</b> alludes to <b>bloodshed; and so it states: “One who sheds the blood of man,</b> by man his blood shall be shed” (Genesis 9:6). |
| Leviticus 24:16 | when he blasphemes the name he shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 66a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Who are the Rabbis</b> mentioned here? <b>It is Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, says:</b> The verse states: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him; the convert as well as the homeborn, <b>when he blasphemes the name he shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “the name”</b> a second time, which appears to be a superfluous repetition? This term <b>taught concerning</b> one who transgresses other prohibitions of cursing, e.g., <b>one who curses his father or his mother, that he is not liable</b> to be executed by stoning <b>unless he curses them with the name</b> of God. If he merely uses an appellation, he is exempt. |
| Leviticus 24:16 | Wasn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death” | Shevuot 36a:16 | <b>The Sages taught</b> that it is written: <b>“Each and every man who shall curse his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16)? One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one would be liable only for</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God <b>alone. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> liability for one who curses <b>the appellations</b> of God? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Each and every man who shall curse his God,”</b> indicating that one is liable <b>in any case,</b> even for cursing an appellation. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. The Rabbis say: For</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God, one is liable to be executed <b>with</b> a court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated explicitly in the verse. <b>And for</b> cursing one of the <b>appellations</b> of God, one is liable <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition,</b> but he is not liable to be executed. |
| Leviticus 24:16 | “When he blasphemes a name, he shall be put to death” | Shevuot 36a:18 | The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei says:</b> It is stated with regard to one who blasphemes God: <b>“When he blasphemes a name, he shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “a name,”</b> when it is stated at the beginning of the verse: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”? This extraneous word “name” <b>taught with regard to one who curses his father or his mother that he is not liable</b> to be executed through stoning <b>until he curses them in the name</b> of God. |
| Leviticus 24:17 | “And a man who strikes any person mortally shall be put to death” | Bava Kamma83b:12 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the verses discussing one who injures another: <b>“And a man who strikes any person mortally shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:17), which presumably means that in the case of one who severs another’s extremity the same injury, i.e., death of a limb, is done to the one who caused the injury, and he does not pay monetary compensation? The Gemara answers: The verse does not mean that his limb shall be put to death, i.e., removed, but rather, that he should pay compensation <b>with money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you say <b>that</b> the verse is referring to paying compensation <b>with money?</b> Why not <b>say</b> that he is punished <b>with actual death</b> i.e., loss of a limb? |
| Leviticus 24:17 | and one who kills him is liable | Niddah 44a:1 | <b>and he inherits</b> the estate of his mother if she died on the day of his birth; <b>and</b> if he dies, <b>he bequeaths</b> that inheritance to his paternal brothers; <b>and one who kills him is liable</b> for his murder, as it is written: “And he that smites any man mortally shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17), i.e., any man, including a child who is one day old; <b>and</b> if he dies, <b>his</b> status in relation <b>to his father and to his mother and to all his relatives,</b> in terms of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning, is <b>like</b> that of <b>a full-fledged groom [<i>keḥatan shalem</i>],</b> whose death is deeply mourned. |
| Leviticus 24:17 | as it is written: “And he who smites any man mortally | Niddah 44b:6 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And one who kills</b> a one-day-old baby is <b>liable</b> for his murder. The Gemara explains that the reason for this is <b>as it is written: “And he who smites any man mortally</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17), where the phrase “any man” indicates that this verse applies <b>in any case,</b> even in the case of a one-day-old baby. |
| Leviticus 24:17 | “And a man who strikes any soul mortally, | Sanhedrin 78a:3 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both</b> Rabbis, i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, <b>interpreted the same verse</b> in drawing their halakhic conclusion. The verse states: <b>“And a man who strikes any soul mortally,</b> he shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17). <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>“any soul”</b> means that one is liable for murder <b>only when there is an entire soul,</b> i.e., when the murderer alone is responsible for taking the entire life of the victim. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira holds</b> that <b>“any soul”</b> means that one is liable for murder for taking <b>any soul,</b> even if the victim had already been beaten and was close to death. |
| Leviticus 24:17 | “And a man who strikes any soul mortally, | Sanhedrin 78a:7 | <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet:</b> The verse that states: <b>“And a man who strikes any soul mortally,</b> he shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17), serves <b>to include</b> the case of <b>one who strikes another and</b> it is a blow <b>in which there is not sufficient</b> force <b>to kill, and</b> then <b>another</b> individual <b>comes and kills him;</b> the verse teaches <b>that</b> the second individual <b>is liable.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:18 | Rabbi Ami said: As the verse states: “One who strikes an animal shall pay for it [ yeshallemenna ]” | Bava Kamma10b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Ami said: As the verse states: “One who strikes an animal shall pay for it [<i>yeshallemenna</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). <b>Do not read</b> the final word <b><i>yeshallemenna</i>,</b> meaning he shall pay for it; <b>rather,</b> read it as though it were vocalized as <b><i>yashlimenna</i>,</b> meaning he shall complete it, to teach that he shall complete the injured party’s compensation, which is already partially accounted for by the injured party’s right to sell his animal’s carcass. |
| Leviticus 24:18 | from here: “One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation, a life for a life” | Bava Kamma83b:11 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> references the verse <b>from here: “One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18); <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> is the verse: <b>“And if a man maims his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19). The Gemara challenges: But <b>this</b> latter verse <b>does not</b> use the expression: <b>“One who strikes,”</b> which is the basis for the comparison in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>We are stating</b> an analogy from <b>striking</b> to <b>striking</b> that is based not upon the exact phrasing of the verse but upon the details of the <i>halakha</i>, as follows: <b>Just as</b> the act of <b>striking that is stated with regard to an animal</b> renders one liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation, so too,</b> the act of <b>striking that is stated with regard to a person</b> renders one liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:18 | “One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation” | Bava Kamma83b:13 | The Gemara answers: That interpretation should <b>not enter your mind</b> for two reasons. <b>One</b> reason is that this verse <b>is juxtaposed to</b> the following verse: <b>“One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). <b>And furthermore, it is written after it:</b> “A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; <b>as he has given a blemish to a person, so shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20); <b>and learn from</b> the use of the word “given” that the verse is referring to <b>money.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:18 | which is stated: “And he that kills the soul of an animal shall pay it” | Beitzah 21a:15 | The Gemara answers: The question of whether or not one may perform prohibited labor on a Festival for the sake of dogs <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done for you.” By inference, from that which is stated: “Every soul,” I</b> might <b>derive</b> that <b>even the soul of an animal is included, similar to</b> that <b>which is stated: “And he that kills the soul of an animal shall pay it”</b> (Leviticus 24:18), indicating that the life force of an animal is also called a soul. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> and emphasizes: <b>“For you,”</b> |
| Leviticus 24:18 | “And he who smites an animal shall pay for it, a life for a life” | Ketubot 35a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where did</b> the <b>Torah include</b> those liable to be flogged? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to die” (Numbers 35:31), and the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to be flogged” (Deuteronomy 25:2). <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>smites</b> in one verse and the term <b>smites</b> in another verse. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> To <b>which</b> term <b>smites</b> are you referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is the verse <b>“And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die”</b> (Leviticus 24:21), clearly that is not so, as <b>that is written with regard to death.</b> Smiting a person in that verse is referring to murder. <b>Rather,</b> it is to <b>this</b> term <b>smites</b> that Rava is referring: <b>“And he who smites an animal shall pay for it, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, as he has done so shall be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19). The verses liken those liable to receive lashes to those obligated to pay money, from which it is derived that those liable to receive lashes are exempt from payment. |
| Leviticus 24:18 | he who smites the body [ nefesh ] of an animal” | Nazir 48a:6 | <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> from this verse that a nazirite is prohibited from coming near all bodies, <b>including even the body of an animal, similar to that which is stated:</b> “And <b>he who smites the body [<i>nefesh</i>] of an animal”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall not come near to a dead body,”</b> employing the dual term <i>nefesh met</i>, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of the body of a person. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> This exposition <b>is unnecessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “He shall not come near,”</b> indicating that <b>the verse is speaking</b> only <b>of bodies that render</b> people and items <b>ritually impure through going in,</b> i.e., entering. In other words, the verse is referring solely to corpses. Entering into a tent in which the corpse is contained renders one impure. By contrast, an animal carcass imparts impurity only by means of contact and carrying. |
| Leviticus 24:19 | another” | Bava Kamma26a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to this matter: “And if <b>a man</b> maims <b>another”</b> (Leviticus 24:19), from which it can be derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies when a man harms another person <b>but not</b> when <b>an ox</b> harms <b>another</b> person. |
| Leviticus 24:19 | “And if a man maims his neighbor, | Bava Kamma33a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Akiva</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>exempting him from</b> paying these <b>four types of indemnity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“And if a man maims his neighbor,</b> as he has done, so shall be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19). Rabbi Akiva derives from here that only when <b>a man</b> injures <b>his neighbor</b> is he liable to pay these four types of indemnity, <b>but not</b> when <b>an ox</b> injures <b>his neighbor.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:19 | “And if a man maims his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him” | Bava Kamma83b:11 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> references the verse <b>from here: “One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18); <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> is the verse: <b>“And if a man maims his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19).

| Leviticus 24:19 | of the school of Rabbi Yishmael are interpreting a superfluous verse. Now, it is written: “And if a man gives a blemish to his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him” | Bava Kamma84a:6 | The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The rabbis <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael are interpreting a superfluous verse. Now, it is written: “And if a man gives a blemish to his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19), so <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“So shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)? <b>Learn from</b> the repetition that the verse is referring to <b>monetary restitution.</b> The Gemara asks: But if this is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)? What does the usage of the term “<i>yitten</i>” teach? The Gemara answers: In fact, it does not teach anything, but rather, <b>since</b> the Merciful One <b>needs to write</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“So shall it be given unto him,”</b> where the employment of a term of giving is accurate, the Merciful One <b>also wrote</b> earlier in the verse: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person.”</b> |
| Leviticus 24:19 | as he has done so shall be done to him” | Ketubot 32b:7 | The same can be said with regard to <b>one who injures another. Now, since it states:</b> “And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, <b>as he has done so shall be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19), <b>why do I</b> require the Torah to state: “As one who places a blemish upon a man, <b>so shall be placed [<i>yinnaten</i>] upon him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)? This teaches that this is referring to <b>an item that involves giving [<i>netina</i>], and what is that</b> item? It is <b>money.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:19 | “And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, as he has done so shall be done to him” | Ketubot 35a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where did</b> the <b>Torah include</b> those liable to be flogged? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to die” (Numbers 35:31), and the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to be flogged” (Deuteronomy 25:2). <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>smites</b> in one verse and the term <b>smites</b> in another verse. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> To <b>which</b> term <b>smites</b> are you referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is the verse <b>“And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die”</b> (Leviticus 24:21), clearly that is not so, as <b>that is written with regard to death.</b> Smiting a person in that verse is referring to murder. <b>Rather,</b> it is to <b>this</b> term <b>smites</b> that Rava is referring: <b>“And he who smites an animal shall pay for it, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, as he has done so shall be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19). The verses liken those liable to receive lashes to those obligated to pay money, from which it is derived that those liable to receive lashes are exempt from payment. |
| Leviticus 24:20 | as he has given a blemish to a person, so shall it be given unto him” | Bava Kamma83b:13 | The Gemara answers: That interpretation should <b>not enter your mind</b> for two reasons. <b>One</b> reason is that this verse <b>is juxtaposed to</b> the following verse: <b>“One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). <b>And furthermore, it is written after it:</b> “A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; <b>as he has given a blemish to a person, so shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20); <b>and learn from</b> the use of the word “given” that the verse is referring to <b>money.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:20 | “An eye for an eye” | Bava Kamma83b:20 | § The Gemara presents a series of derivations for the principle that one who injures another is liable to pay monetary compensation. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says:</b> The phrase: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), means <b>monetary restitution.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that he must pay the victim <b>monetary restitution, or is it only</b> teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <b>an actual eye? You say:</b> There may be a case where <b>the eye of</b> the one who caused the injury <b>is large and the eye of</b> the injured party is <b>small. How can I read</b> and literally apply the phrase <b>“an eye for an eye” in this</b> case? |
| Leviticus 24:20 | Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “An eye for an eye” | Bava Kamma84a:2 | The Gemara presents another derivation: It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “An eye for an eye”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), is referring to <b>monetary restitution.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that this is referring to <b>monetary restitution, or is it only</b> teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <b>an actual eye?</b> There may be a case where <b>there was a blind person and he blinded</b> another, or there was <b>one with a severed limb and he severed</b> the limb of another, or there was <b>a lame person and he caused</b> another <b>to be lame. In this</b> case, <b>how can I fulfill “an eye for an eye”</b> literally, when he is already lacking the limb that must be injured? If one will suggest that in that case, a monetary penalty will be imposed, that can be refuted: <b>But the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), which teaches that <b>the law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:20 | so shall it be given unto him” | Bava Kamma84a:5 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; as he has given a blemish to a person, <b>so shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), <b>and giving can</b> refer <b>only</b> to a payment of <b>money.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But if that is so,</b> then when the same verse states: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person,”</b> does <b>this</b> word, “<i>yitten</i>,” <b>also</b> refer <b>to money?</b> The word “<i>yitten</i>” means that he caused an actual injury, even though it employs a term whose literal meaning is give. |
| Leviticus 24:20 | “So shall it be given unto him” | Bava Kamma84a:6 | The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The rabbis <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael are interpreting a superfluous verse. Now, it is written: “And if a man gives a blemish to his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19), so <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“So shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)? <b>Learn from</b> the repetition that the verse is referring to <b>monetary restitution.</b> The Gemara asks: But if this is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)?

| Leviticus 24:21 | in accordance with what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: | Bava Kamma35a:9 | The Gemara explains: This is <b>in accordance with what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: “And he who kills an animal shall pay for it, and he who kills a man shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), indicating that <b>one who kills a man and one who kills an animal</b> are comparable. |
| Leviticus 24:21 | “One who strikes an animal shall pay its compensation, and one who strikes a person shall be put to death” | Bava Kamma83b:10 | The Gemara asks: To <b>which</b> verse is the <i>baraita</i> referring when it quotes: <b>“One who strikes</b> a person” and: “One who strikes an animal”? <b>If we say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the verse: <b>“One who strikes an animal shall pay its compensation, and one who strikes a person shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:21), this cannot be, as <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to killing,</b> not injury, and there is no monetary compensation for killing. |
| Leviticus 24:21 | “One who strikes a person | Bava Kamma83b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> potential difficulty with the first derivation did the <i>baraita</i> refer to when it prefaced its second derivation with the phrase: <b>If it is your wish to say?</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> means that <b>a further difficulty</b> was troubling <b>to the <i>tanna</i>: What did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>derive</b> the principle of monetary payment <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“one who strikes an animal”?</b> Why not <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“One who strikes a person</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), and learn that causing an injury renders one liable to receive physical retribution, which is analogous to death, and not monetary payment? |
| Leviticus 24:21 | one who smites an animal. | Ketubot 35a:2 | <b>Rava said: Is there anyone who said</b> that <b>those</b> who <b>unwittingly</b> performed a transgression for which one is <b>liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>are obligated</b> to pay? <b>But didn’t</b> the Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya teach:</b> The verse speaks of <b>one who smites a person, and</b> the verse speaks of <b>one who smites an animal.</b> The two cases are juxtaposed in the verse “And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die” (Leviticus 24:21). |
| Leviticus 24:21 | “And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die” | Ketubot 35a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where did</b> the <b>Torah include</b> those liable to be flogged? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to die” (Numbers 35:31), and the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to be flogged” (Deuteronomy 25:2). <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>smites</b> in one verse and the term <b>smites</b> in another verse. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> To <b>which</b> term <b>smites</b> are you referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is the verse <b>“And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die”</b> (Leviticus 24:21), clearly that is not so, as <b>that is written with regard to death.</b> Smiting a person in that verse is referring to murder. <b>Rather,</b> it is to <b>this</b> term <b>smites</b> that Rava is referring: <b>“And he who smites an animal shall pay for it, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, as he has done so shall be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19). The verses liken those liable to receive lashes to those obligated to pay money, from which it is derived that those liable to receive lashes are exempt from payment. |
| Leviticus 24:21 | should not enter your mind, as it is written: “And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die” | Ketubot 35b:3 | The Gemara answers: That notion <b>should not enter your mind, as it is written: “And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die”</b> (Leviticus 24:21). <b>What are the circumstances</b> discussed in this verse? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>did not forewarn him,</b> i.e., when <b>one who smites a person</b> is not forewarned, <b>why should he be executed?</b> There is no corporal punishment, neither lashes nor execution, without forewarning. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious that they forewarned him. And if</b> the verse is referring to one who sinned <b>on Shabbat</b> after forewarning, would <b>one who smites an animal</b> be obligated to <b>pay for it?</b> He is executed and certainly exempt from payment. <b>Rather, isn’t</b> the verse clearly referring to a case <b>during the week?</b> |
| Leviticus 24:21 | one who smites a person, and one who smites an animal | Ketubot 38a:2 | <b>Rava said to him: That</b> principle <b>is derived</b> from that which the Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, as</b> the Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse juxtaposes the cases of <b>one who smites a person, and one who smites an animal</b> (Leviticus 24:21). |
| Leviticus 24:21 | As the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: | Sanhedrin 79b:2 | <b>Rava says: That</b> which <b>the school of Ḥizkiyya taught diverges from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and diverges from</b> the statement <b>of the Rabbis.</b> The school of Ḥizkiyya holds that in the case where one intended to kill one individual and killed another individual, he is exempt from both liability to be executed, counter to the opinion of the Rabbis, and from the obligation to pay monetary restitution. <b>As the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: “And he who kills an animal shall pay for it, and he who kills a man shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), indicating that <b>one who kills a man and one who kills an animal</b> are comparable. |
| Leviticus 24:21 | and one who strikes a person | Sanhedrin 84b:8 | The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “And one who strikes an animal</b> shall pay for it; <b>and one who strikes a person</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), juxtaposing one who strikes an individual with one who strikes an animal. An earlier verse states: “One who strikes the soul of an animal shall pay for it” (Leviticus 24:18). Based on this it is derived: <b>Just as one who strikes an animal</b> is not liable <b>unless he wounds it</b> and draws blood, <b>as “soul” is written concerning it,</b> and it can be derived from the verse: “For the blood is the soul” (Deuteronomy 12:23), that the term “soul” is a reference to blood, <b>so too, one who strikes a person</b> is not liable <b>unless he causes a wound</b> and draws blood. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | the Torah said: “You shall have one manner of law” | Bava Kamma83b:21 | The Gemara continues the derivation: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>in all cases like this,</b> where their eyes are different sizes, the injured party <b>takes monetary restitution</b> from the one who caused him injury, but in a case where their eyes are the same size, the one who caused injury is punished by actually having his eye removed, this cannot be, as <b>the Torah said: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), teaching that the <b>law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:22 | the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law” | Bava Kamma84a:1 | in the case of <b>a small</b> person <b>who killed a large</b> person, <b>or a large</b> person <b>who killed a small</b> person, <b>how do we kill</b> the murderer? If one suggests that in such a case a monetary penalty will be imposed, <b>the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), teaching that the <b>law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you,</b> so the punishment must be the same for all murderers. <b>Rather,</b> explain that since the murderer <b>took the life of</b> the victim, <b>the Merciful One states that</b> the court should likewise <b>take the life from him. So too,</b> since the one who caused the injury <b>took</b> the <b>sight from</b> the eye of the injured party, <b>the Merciful One states</b> that the court should likewise <b>take</b> the <b>sight from</b> his eye. Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, in accordance with the objection of the Sages. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | But the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law” | Bava Kamma84a:2 | The Gemara presents another derivation: It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “An eye for an eye”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), is referring to <b>monetary restitution.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that this is referring to <b>monetary restitution, or is it only</b> teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <b>an actual eye?</b> There may be a case where <b>there was a blind person and he blinded</b> another, or there was <b>one with a severed limb and he severed</b> the limb of another, or there was <b>a lame person and he caused</b> another <b>to be lame. In this</b> case, <b>how can I fulfill “an eye for an eye”</b> literally, when he is already lacking the limb that must be injured? If one will suggest that in that case, a monetary penalty will be imposed, that can be refuted: <b>But the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), which teaches that <b>the law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you.</b> |
| Leviticus 24:22 | the verse states: “You shall have one manner of law” | Ketubot 33a:7 | <b>Rav Samma, son of Rav Yirmeya,</b> strongly <b>objects to this: However, if</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> when witnesses falsely accuse a priest of being <b>the son of a divorcée or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>, as they are not included in</b> the verse <b>“As he conspired”</b> but rather they are punished for violating the prohibition “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,” <b>let them require forewarning.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), meaning that there must be <b>a law equal for all of you.</b> Since in standard cases of conspiring witnesses no forewarning is required, even in exceptional cases like testimony that a priest is the son of a divorcée or a <i>ḥalutza</i>, forewarning is not required. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | law, | Kiddushin 62b:1 | <b>A convert requires</b> the presence of <b>three</b> Jews for his conversion. <b>What is the reason</b> for this requirement? <b>It is written with regard to</b> a convert: “You shall have one manner of <b>law,</b> for the convert as for the homeborn” (Leviticus 24:22), which indicates that a conversion is <b>considered a judgment</b> that requires three judges. And if he requires three judges, <b>who says that those three will be available to him?</b> Since he cannot convert at a time of his choosing, it is not considered within his power to convert. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | the verse states: “You shall have one manner of law” | Sanhedrin 28a:15 | The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), which is interpreted to mean: <b>A law that is equal for you.</b> In other words, monetary law and capital law essentially follow the same guidelines. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law” | Sanhedrin 32a:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Both</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law are equal with regard to</b> the requirement for <b>inquiry and interrogation</b> of the witnesses, <b>as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), meaning that all legal procedures must be uniform. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law” | Sanhedrin 32a:16 | The Gemara cites the first answer. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: By Torah law, both</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> are equal <b>with regard to inquiry and interrogation</b> of witnesses, <b>as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22). <b>And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that in cases of <b>monetary law we do not need inquiry and interrogation?</b> It is an ordinance instituted by the Sages <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers.</b> The Sages were concerned that intensive examination of the witnesses would often result in contradictory testimony and render it difficult for lenders to collect their debts. This could lead to people refraining from lending money. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law” | Sanhedrin 3a:1 | The source for this is <b>as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), from which it is derived that all judges must judge in the same manner. And since with regard to cases of capital law it is stated: “And you shall inquire and investigate, and ask diligently” (Deuteronomy 13:15), the same should apply to cases of monetary law. <b>And what is the reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that in cases of <b>monetary law we do not require inquiry and interrogation</b> of witnesses? The Gemara answers: The Sages established this exemption <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers.</b> If inquiry and interrogation of the witnesses would be required in order to have the court rule that the lender can collect payment of a loan, lenders would be deterred by the difficulty of proving the matter and might cease to lend money to the poor. For the same reason, the Sages also waived the need for expert judges in these cases. |
| Leviticus 24:22 | is stated: “You shall have one law” | Yevamot 122b:8 | The Gemara comments: <b>And they disagree about</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: By Torah law, both</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> require scrutiny <b>by means of inquiry and interrogation</b> of witnesses, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “You shall have one law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), indicating that the legal procedures must be the same for each area of <i>halakha</i>. Consequently, since inquiry and interrogation are required for capital law (Deuteronomy 13:15), they are required for cases of monetary law as well. |
| Leviticus 24:23 | and they brought him that had cursed out of the camp, | Sanhedrin 42b:15 | <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The matter of the location of the place of stoning can be derived from the verses themselves: <b>Where was Moses sitting</b> when the matter of the blasphemer was brought before him? <b>In the Levite camp,</b> as he was a Levite, and it was there that the blasphemer was brought for trial. <b>And the Merciful One said to</b> Moses: <b>“Take out him who has cursed to outside the camp,”</b> indicating that he should be taken <b>outside the Levite camp</b> into the Israelite camp. And later it says: “And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, <b>and they brought him that had cursed out of the camp,</b> and they stoned him with a stone. And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses” (Leviticus 24:23), teaching that he was taken <b>outside the Israelite camp</b> as well. |
| Leviticus 24:23 | “And they brought him that had cursed | Sanhedrin 43a:5 | <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The location of the place of stoning can be directly derived from the verse discussing the blasphemer but in a slightly different manner. <b>Where was Moses sitting</b> when the matter of the blasphemer was brought before him? <b>In the Levite camp. And the Merciful One said to him: “Take out him who has cursed”</b> (Leviticus 24:14), indicating that he should be taken <b>outside the Levite camp</b> into the Israelite camp. And God continued in that verse: <b>“Outside the camp,”</b> which is an additional command that he should be removed even further, to <b>outside the Israelite camp.</b> And the later verse, which says: <b>“And they brought him that had cursed</b> out of the camp…and the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses” (Leviticus 24:23), teaches us <b>about the implementation</b> of God’s instructions, i.e., that the children of Israel did in fact carry out His command. |
| Leviticus 25:3 | state: “Six years you shall sow your field” | Nedarim 61a:5 | The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Doesn’t</b> the verse <b>state: “Six years you shall sow your field”</b> (Leviticus 25:3)? <b>But</b> according to your opinion <b>there are only five</b> years <b>here,</b> in the Sabbatical cycle following the Jubilee Year, as the first year would be the Jubilee Year, when it is forbidden to sow one’s field. |
| Leviticus 25:4 | as it is already stated: “You shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard” | Makkot 8b:3 | <b>Some teach</b> this exchange <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“In plowing and in harvest you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This verse is referring to the Sabbatical Year. The Torah <b>does not need to state</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing</b> during the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>or harvesting</b> during the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>as it is already stated: “You shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). What, then, is derived from this verse? <b>Rather,</b> it is derived that <b>even plowing</b> on the <b>eve of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>which</b> facilitates growth of crops when the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>enters, and</b> the <b>harvest of</b> crops that grew during the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>which emerged</b> and were reaped after the <b>conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year, are prohibited. |
| Leviticus 25:4 | Rabbi Ile’a said. | Moed Katan3a:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that one who plows during the Sabbatical Year <b>is flogged does not</b> accept the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verses as follows: The verse “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4) is a generalization stated as a positive mitzva. The continuation of the verse is “Your field you shall not sow,” which is a detail stated as a negative mitzva. This is followed by another generalization: “For it shall be a year of rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:5). By applying the principle of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, one can derive that there is a prohibition against performing any agricultural task that is similar to sowing, including plowing. |
| Leviticus 25:4 | not | Moed Katan3a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> that <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning? From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding, hoeing, and cutting weeds</b> are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune” (Leviticus 25:4). By placing the word “not” immediately following the words “field” and “vineyard,” the verse indicates that one may <b>not</b> perform <b>any labor that</b> is generally performed <b>in your field, and</b> one may <b>not</b> perform <b>any labor that</b> is generally performed <b>in your vineyard.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:4 | “Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune” | Moed Katan3a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning. From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding,</b> i.e., uprooting weeds, <b>hoeing, and cutting weeds,</b> even without uprooting them, are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune.” This wording indicates that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:4 | Sowing was included | Moed Katan3a:8 | The Gemara explains the derivation: <b>Sowing was included</b> in the general prohibition against performing agricultural labors during the Sabbatical Year, as the verse states “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Why was</b> sowing <b>singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? In order <b>to compare</b> other types of labor <b>to it</b> and to <b>say to you: Just as sowing is unique in that it is labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard, so too, any</b> other <b>labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard</b> is prohibited. However, labors performed only in the vineyard but not in the field, i.e., whose objective is merely to sustain the vines from year to year, such as the labors mentioned above, are permitted. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that many subcategories of labor are prohibited during the seventh year, and not just sowing and pruning, as Rava had stated. |
| Leviticus 25:4 | your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune” | Moed Katan3b:13 | The Gemara raises another question: <b>Are these</b> prohibitions of plowing before the Sabbatical Year really <b><i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>They are</b> actually prohibitions based on explicit <b>verses. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“In plowing and in reaping you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21) that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is unnecessary</b> for the verse <b>to speak</b> about <b>plowing and reaping during the Sabbatical Year, as it was already stated:</b> “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath for the Lord; <b>your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). This teaches that during the seventh year all agricultural labor is prohibited. <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes to prohibit <b>plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year</b> |
| Leviticus 25:4 | Shabbat | Moed Katan4a:7 | <b>What is the reason? He derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>Shabbat</b> stated with regard to the Sabbatical Year in the verse: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> the word <b>Shabbat</b> stated with regard to the weekly Shabbat, which commemorates <b>the Shabbat of Creation. Just as there,</b> on Shabbat <b>itself it is prohibited</b> to perform labor, but <b>before and after</b> Shabbat <b>it is permitted, so too here,</b> in the case of the Sabbatical Year, during the Sabbatical Year <b>itself it is prohibited</b> to perform labor, but <b>before and after</b> the Sabbatical Year <b>it is permitted.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:4 | As it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land” | Rosh Hashanah8b:6 | § The mishna teaches: The first of Tishrei is also the New Year <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land”</b> (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> we <b>learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Tishrei, as it is written: “From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The latter verse is referring to the year that begins at the onset of the rainy season, i.e., Tishrei. |
| Leviticus 25:4 | you shall neither sow your field, | Rosh Hashanah9a:3 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“In plowing and in harvest you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is unnecessary to state</b> this <b>about plowing and harvesting during the Sabbatical Year, as it is already stated:</b> “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land, a Shabbat for the Lord; <b>you shall neither sow your field,</b> nor prune your vineyard” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Rather,</b> the verse: “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest,” is referring to <b>plowing in the year preceding the Sabbatical Year going into the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., plowing in the sixth year that will benefit the crops growing in the Sabbatical Year, <b>and</b> about <b>harvesting of the Sabbatical Year going into the year that follows the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., harvesting grain that grew in the Sabbatical Year in the eighth year. This teaches that there is a requirement to add extra time to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year, and not work the land both before and after. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | for food | Avodah Zarah62a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does it mean when it says that <b>their wage</b> is <b>Sabbatical</b>-Year produce? <b>If we say that we give them</b> their <b>wage</b> for their work <b>from Sabbatical</b>-Year <b>produce,</b> the employer <b>consequently is paying his debt from Sabbatical</b>-Year <b>produce, and</b> this violates that which <b>the Torah states:</b> “And the Sabbatical produce of the land shall be <b>for food</b> for you” (Leviticus 25:6), indicating that this produce is designated for food, <b>but not for commerce.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:6 | for food | Bava Kamma101b:6 | <b>And</b> Rava <b>answers</b> the contradiction, as <b>the verse states:</b> “And the Sabbath produce of the land shall be <b>for food</b> for you” (Leviticus 25:6), indicating that the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect only <b>with regard to those</b> items <b>whose benefit and whose consumption coincide,</b> as is the case with regard to food. <b>Wood is excluded, as its benefit follows its consumption.</b> The primary purpose of kindling wood is not accomplished with the burning of the wood; rather, it is with the charcoal that heats the oven. Therefore, wood is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | “For food” | Bava Kamma102a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> for the statement <b>of the Rabbis? The verse states</b> with regard to Sabbatical Year produce: <b>“For food”</b> (Leviticus 25:6), from which it is inferred: <b>But not for soaking; “for food,” but not for laundering. And Rabbi Yosei says</b> that it is permitted, as <b>the verse</b> also <b>states: “For you,”</b> from which it is inferred: For you, <b>for all your needs,</b> even for soaking and for laundering. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | the Merciful One states | Bekhorot 12b:3 | The Gemara clarifies the question: With regard to redeeming a donkey that has <b>definite</b> firstborn status with an animal that was purchased with produce of the Sabbatical Year, <b>you should not raise the dilemma,</b> as one certainly may not redeem it in this manner, since the owner acquires his firstborn donkey in exchange for the animal that he gives to the priest, and this is prohibited with regard to such an animal. This is because <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year: “The rest of the land shall be for you for consumption” (Leviticus 25:6), indicating that the produce may be used <b>for consumption but not for commerce.</b> Rather, <b>when should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it in the case of a donkey with <b>uncertain</b> firstborn status. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | Didn’t we learn | Berakhot 36b:9 | <b>Rav Shimi of Neharde’a strongly objects to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei <b>with regard to</b> the fruits <b>of all other trees</b> besides grapes, that even in the very first stage of ripening, they are considered fruit? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to fruit, which grows during the Sabbatical year, the Torah says: “And the Shabbat of the land shall be to you for eating” (Leviticus 25:6). The Sages inferred, for eating, and not for loss. Because one is prohibited from discarding fruit grown during the Sabbatical year, the question is raised: <b>From when may one no</b> longer <b>cut trees during the Sabbatical year</b> as he thereby damages the fruit? <b>Beit Shammai say: All trees, from when</b> the blossoms fall off and <b>fruit</b> begins to <b>emerge</b> in its earliest stage. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> There is a distinction between different types of trees. <b>Carob trees</b> may not be cut <b>from when they</b> form <b>chains</b> of carobs, <b>vines</b> may not be cut <b><i>misheyegaru</i>,</b> explained below, <b>olives from when they blossom, and all other trees from when</b> fruit <b>emerges.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:6 | for eating” | Menachot 84a:5 | <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a contradiction to Rav Ḥisda: We learned</b> in that mishna that <b>the guards of <i>sefiḥin</i> during the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>collect their wages from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> This indicates that even in the Sabbatical Year, the <i>omer</i> is brought from that year’s crop. <b>And one can raise a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the Sabbatical Year of the land shall be for you <b>for eating”</b> (Leviticus 25:6), which indicates it is to be used for eating, <b>but not for burning.</b> Accordingly, since the <i>omer</i> is burned on the altar, it should not be brought from produce of the Sabbatical Year. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | How did he do this? The Merciful One says: | Pesachim 52b:9 | The Gemara continues to discuss the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year: <b>Rabbi Elai chopped</b> down a palm tree containing <b>unripe dates of the Sabbatical Year.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How did he do this? The Merciful One says:</b> “And the Sabbatical produce of the land shall be for you to eat” (Leviticus 25:6), from which it is inferred: <b>To eat and not to destroy.</b> It is prohibited to destroy Sabbatical Year produce, and it is permitted only to eat it. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>this</b> restriction <b>applies</b> only in a case <b>where it has reached</b> the status <b>of fruit, but</b> in a case <b>where it has not</b> yet <b>reached</b> the status of <b>fruit, no,</b> it does not apply; <b>didn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Those <i>orla</i> date coverings are prohibited</b> like other <i>orla</i> fruit, as their legal status is that of food <b>because they became protection for the fruit?</b> They are not considered part of the tree that may be eaten in the <i>orla</i> years. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | for you for food” | Sukkah 40a:5 | The Gemara answers: It is <b>different there,</b> in the case of the reed and vine leaves, <b>as the verse states:</b> “And the Sabbatical produce of the land shall be <b>for you for food”</b> (Leviticus 25:6). From the juxtaposition of the term: For you, and the term: For food, it is derived: <b>For you</b> is <b>similar to for food;</b> the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect on <b>those</b> items <b>whose benefit and whose consumption coincide. Wood is excluded, as its benefit is subsequent to its consumption.</b> The primary purpose of kindling wood is not accomplished with the burning of the wood; rather, it is with the charcoal that heats the oven. Therefore, it is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year. |
| Leviticus 25:7 | be” | Bava Kamma101a:15 | The Gemara attempts another resolution of the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>the peels of</b> produce from the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year must be <b>burned</b> when the time for the elimination of Sabbatical Year produce arrives. This indicates that the dye evidently remains an independent substance. The Gemara rejects this proof: It <b>is different there, as the verse states: “Shall</b> all the increase thereof <b>be”</b> (Leviticus 25:7), and the phrase: “Shall be,” teaches that it <b>will</b> always <b>remain as it is,</b> i.e., it retains its status as Sabbatical Year produce despite any change to its form. |
| Leviticus 25:7 | “And for the cattle and the beasts that are in your land, all its produce may be eaten” | Niddah 51b:12 | The Gemara explains <b>that it is written</b> in connection to the Sabbatical Year: <b>“And for the cattle and the beasts that are in your land, all its produce may be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 25:7), from which it is derived: <b>As long as the undomesticated animals eat</b> a type of produce <b>from the field, you may feed</b> that type of produce <b>to your domesticated animal in the house,</b> as it still remains in the field. But if that type of produce <b>has ceased for the undomesticated animals in the field, you must cease</b> feeding it <b>to your domesticated animal in the house.</b> This is the obligation of eradication. <b>And these,</b> the root of the wild arum and the ceterach, <b>have not ceased for undomesticated animals</b> in the field, and therefore there is no obligation of eradication. |
| Leviticus 25:7 | “And for the cattle and the beasts that are in your land, | Pesachim 52b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that it is permitted to continue eating a type of fruit that has ceased from the fields in a region, as long as it has not ceased elsewhere in the land, but that once it has ceased from the fields in the entire land it is prohibited, despite the fact that it has not ceased from the fields in the other lands? <b>Rav Ḥama bar Ukva said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: The verse says</b> with regard to land during the Sabbatical Year: <b>“And for the cattle and the beasts that are in your land,</b> all its produce may be eaten” (Leviticus 25:7), from which it is derived: <b>As long as the undomesticated animals eat</b> a type of produce <b>from the field, one may feed</b> that type <b>to the domesticated animal in</b> his <b>house,</b> as it still remains in the field. Deriving benefit from that type of produce is permitted. However, if that type of produce <b>has ceased for the undomesticated animals in the field, cease</b> providing it <b>to your domesticated animal in the house.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:7 | “And for your cattle and for the beasts in your land | Taanit 6b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one must remove the produce of the Sabbatical Year from one’s possession? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year: <b>“And for your cattle and for the beasts in your land</b> all its increase shall be for food” (Leviticus 25:7). This verse indicates that <b>as long as a beast,</b> i.e., a non-domesticated animal, is able to find and <b>eat</b> produce <b>in the field, you</b> may <b>feed your cattle,</b> your domesticated animals, from that type of food <b>in the house.</b> However, when a given type of produce <b>has ceased</b> to be available <b>to the beast in the field, cease</b> providing it to <b>your cattle in the house.</b> After the time of the second rainfall there is no longer any straw or hay in the fields. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | “You shall proclaim | Rosh Hashanah27b:6 | <b>Rav Pappa said: Do not say that</b> this means that <b>he</b> softened the <i>shofar</i> and <b>turned it inside out like a tunic. Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that he widened the narrow</b> end of the <i>shofar</i> <b>and narrowed</b> its <b>wide</b> end. <b>What is the reason</b> that this is unfit? It is <b>according</b> to the opinion <b>of Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana said</b> that the verse states: <b>“You shall proclaim</b> [<i>veha’avarta</i>] with the <i>shofar</i>” (Leviticus 25:9), where the word <i>veha’avarta</i> literally means carry, thereby teaching that <b>we need</b> the <i>shofar</i> to be sounded <b>the</b> same <b>way that it was carried</b> on the head of the animal, and if a change was made, it is unfit. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | As it is written: “On Yom Kippur you shall proclaim with the shofar throughout all your land” | Rosh Hashanah30a:6 | § <b>Some teach this</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna</b> not with regard to this mishna, but rather <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that deals with the Jubilee Year. <b>As it is written: “On Yom Kippur you shall proclaim with the <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land”</b> (Leviticus 25:9). This <b>teaches that each and every individual is obligated to sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>. In this connection <b>Rav Huna said: And</b> they sound it <b>with the court.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>With the court?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>When the court</b> is in session. This serves <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>when the court</b> is <b>not</b> in session, <b>that</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>not</b> sounded. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | with a shofar ? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the shofar | Rosh Hashanah33b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the soundings of Rosh HaShana must be performed <b>with a <i>shofar</i>? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make proclamation with the <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land” (Leviticus 25:9). |
| Leviticus 25:9 | The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the shofar [ shofar terua ]” | Rosh Hashanah33b:13 | This verse states: “The blast [<i>terua</i>] of the <i>shofar</i>,” indicating that one must sound a <i>terua</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>terua</i> sound <b>is preceded by a straight blast,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>? <b>The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i> [<i>shofar terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:9), indicating that the <i>terua</i> must be preceded by the basic sound of a <i>shofar</i>, i.e., by the straight blast of a <i>tekia</i>. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>terua</i> sound <b>is followed by a straight blast? The</b> same <b>verse states</b> again: <b>“You shall make proclamation with the <i>shofar</i>,”</b> which indicates that there must be another <i>tekia</i> after the <i>terua</i>. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | “On the Day of Atonement” | Rosh Hashanah34a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who does not derive this <i>halakha</i> from this verse, <b>from where</b> does he learn that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded <b>during the day and not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that which is stated with regard to the Jubilee Year: <b>“On the Day of Atonement”</b> (Leviticus 25:9), which indicates that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded during the day, not at night. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | veha’avarta | Rosh Hashanah34a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“On the Day of Atonement,” let us also derive from it</b> that one must sound <b>a straight</b> blast of a <i>tekia</i> <b>before</b> each <i>terua</i> <b>and a straight one after it.</b> Since he derives one <i>halakha</i> from the verses that deal with Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year, why not derive this <i>halakha</i> from there as well? In that case, he would not need to derive it from the verses that deal with the wilderness. The Gemara answers: The phrases <b>“Then you shall make proclamation</b> [<b><i>veha’avarta</i></b>]” (Leviticus 25:9) and <b>“You shall make proclamation</b> [<b><i>ta’aviru</i></b>]” from the same verse <b>do not indicate</b> a <i>tekia</i> <b>according to him,</b> as they come to teach a different matter. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | shofar terua | Rosh Hashanah34a:2 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that there must be <b>three</b> sets <b>of three</b> blasts <b>each? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>shofar terua</i></b>]”(Leviticus 25:9); and another verse states: <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24); and a third verse states: <b>“It is a day of sounding [<i>terua</i>] the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1). <i>Terua</i> is mentioned three times in these verses, and a <i>terua</i> is always preceded and followed by a <i>tekia</i>. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | seventh | Rosh Hashanah34a:3 | Since one of these verses deals with Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year, while two of them deal with Rosh HaShana, the Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? With regard to Rosh HaShana, <b>the verse states:</b> “Of the <b>seventh</b> month” (Leviticus 25:9), and with regard to Yom Kippur the verse likewise states: “In the <b>seventh</b> month” (Leviticus 23:24). It is derived <b>by verbal analogy</b> that any <i>shofar</i> blasts sounded on one of these days must also be sounded on the other. Consequently, on each day one must sound three sets of <i>tekia-terua-tekia</i>. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the shofar [ terua ]” | Rosh Hashanah34a:9 | <b>And three <i>teruot</i> are stated</b> with regard <b>to Rosh HaShana: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24); “It is <b>a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>]</b> to you” (Numbers 29:1); <b>“Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:9). <b>And</b> there are <b>two <i>tekiot</i> for each and every one</b> of the <i>teruot</i>, one before and one after. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | on the Day of Atonement you shall pass a shofar throughout your land” | Shabbat 131b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> understand the verse’s emphasis that the mitzva must be performed on that day? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> expression in the verse <b>is necessary</b> according to the Rabbis in order to teach that this mitzva must be performed <b>by day and not by night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Eliezer</b> derive that this mitzva must be performed <b>by day and not by night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse with regard to the laws of the Jubilee Year: “And you shall pass a <i>shofar</i> of sounding in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, <b>on the Day of Atonement you shall pass a <i>shofar</i> throughout your land”</b> (Leviticus 25:9), <b>and</b> the laws of all instances of sounding the <i>shofar</i> during the seventh month <b>are derived from each other.</b> Therefore, just as on Yom Kippur the <i>shofar</i> is sounded during the day, as emphasized by the fact that the verse uses the phrase Day of Atonement, the same applies on Rosh HaShana. |
| Leviticus 25:9 | “And you shall pass a blast of a shofar | Shabbat 96b:3 | <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle: <b>“And they passed a proclamation throughout the camp,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur: <b>“And you shall pass a blast of a <i>shofar</i></b> on the tenth day of the seventh month, on Yom Kippur you shall sound a shofar throughout your land” (Leviticus 25:9). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the <i>shofar</i> of the Jubilee Year, passing is <b>on a day</b> on which it is <b>prohibited</b> to perform labor, <b>so too, here</b> passing is <b>on a day</b> on which it is <b>prohibited</b> to perform labor. |
| Leviticus 25:10 | nullified, as it is stated: “And you shall proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants; | Arakhin 32b:16 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the time <b>that the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled,</b> the counting of <b>Jubilee</b> Years was <b>nullified, as it is stated: “And you shall proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants;</b> it shall be a Jubilee for you” (Leviticus 25:10), indicating that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year apply only <b>when all its inhabitants are in</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and not when some of them have been exiled.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:10 | each man to his family” | Kiddushin 15a:17 | <b>The Master said</b> earlier, in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> it is speaking <b>about a pierced</b> slave, it <b>is already stated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the verse that teaches that a pierced slave is released in the Jubilee Year? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And you shall return, each man to his land, and</b> you shall return, <b>each man to his family”</b> (Leviticus 25:10). <b>What is the verse speaking of? If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who sells himself,</b> it <b>is already stated:</b> “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:40). |
| Leviticus 25:10 | “And you shall return, | Kiddushin 15a:21 | <b>And</b> likewise, <b>it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write</b> with regard to the release of a pierced slave in the Jubilee Year: <b>“And you shall return,</b> each man to his land” (Leviticus 25:10), <b>and it was necessary to write</b> as well: “And he shall serve him <b>forever”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which is interpreted by the Sages as referring to until the Jubilee Year. <b>As, if the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> only <b>“forever,” I would say</b> that this <b>actually</b> means <b>forever,</b> i.e., for his entire life. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “And you shall return.”</b> |
| Leviticus 25:10 | it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written: “And proclaim liberty throughout the land | Kiddushin 38b:5 | The Gemara questions the need for the second ruling of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: <b>The emancipation of slaves is</b> also <b>an obligation of the body,</b> not one that applies to the land. What is novel about this ruling? The Gemara answers that <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written: “And proclaim liberty throughout the land</b> unto all the inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus 25:10), one could say: <b>“Throughout the land,” yes,</b> this mitzva applies, but <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>no,</b> the emancipation does not take effect. Therefore <b>the</b> same <b>verse</b> also <b>states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase: <b>“It shall be a Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), to indicate that it applies <b>in any case,</b> in all places. |
| Leviticus 25:10 | “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year” | Nedarim 61a:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), from which it is derived: <b>You count</b> it as <b>the fiftieth year,</b> i.e., the Jubilee Year, <b>but you do not count</b> it as both the <b>fiftieth year and</b> the <b>first</b> year of the next Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles. <b>From here they stated:</b> The <b>Jubilee Year is not included in the counting of the seven-year</b> cycle of the Sabbatical Year. Rather, the year following the Jubilee Year is considered the first year of the next seven-year cycle. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The Jubilee Year is included in the counting of the</b> following <b>seven-year</b> cycle of the Sabbatical Year. |
| Leviticus 25:10 | as it is stated: “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year” | Rosh Hashanah24a:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: In either case,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon formally, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), from which it is derived: <b>You</b> must formally <b>sanctify years</b> in court, <b>but you do not</b> have to formally <b>sanctify months,</b> as they are sanctified automatically by Heaven. Rather, it is enough merely to announce to the public that a certain day was established as the New Moon. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok,</b> that if the new moon was seen at its anticipated time, the court sanctifies the new month; however, if it was not seen at its anticipated time, they do not sanctify it. |
| Leviticus 25:10 | The Sages taught | Rosh Hashanah9b:2 | § The Gemara continues with the topic of the Jubilee Year. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a Jubilee for you” (Leviticus 25:10). The words <b>“it shall be a Jubilee”</b> come to teach that <b>although they did not release</b> property to its original owners, and <b>although they did not sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, it is nevertheless a Jubilee Year, and the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee year apply. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>although they did not send</b> free the slaves it is also still a Jubilee Year. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be,”</b> this being a term of limitation. This teaches that at least one of the essential <i>halakhot</i> of the year must be observed, and if not, it is not a Jubilee Year. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:10 | as it is stated: “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year” | Sanhedrin 10b:7 | The Gemara notes: With regard to <b>the calculation of the month, yes,</b> this requires three judges. But with regard to the <b>sanctification of month,</b> this does <b>not</b> require three judges. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whether</b> it was reported <b>in its</b> anticipated <b>time</b> or <b>whether</b> it was reported <b>not in its</b> anticipated <b>time, we do not sanctify</b> the New Moon formally, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), which teaches: <b>You</b> must formally <b>sanctify years, but you do not</b> formally <b>sanctify months,</b> as they are sanctified automatically. In any case, calculation, when necessary, is performed by three judges. |
| Leviticus 25:11 | the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year” | Rosh Hashanah8b:12 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:11)? <b>Since it is stated: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as</b> the Jubilee Year <b>is sanctified from its beginning onward, so too, it is sanctified at its end onward,</b> i.e., it remains sanctified until Yom Kippur of the fifty-first year. <b>And do not wonder</b> why one might think this, <b>as don’t we</b> regularly <b>add from the profane to the sacred,</b> extending a sacred time period by adding to it both before and after from a profane time period? <b>Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year, the fiftieth year,”</b> to teach that <b>you sanctify the fiftieth year, but you do not sanctify the fifty-first year,</b> even partially. |
| Leviticus 25:12 | as it is written: “For it is a Jubilee Year; it shall be sacred for you” | Avodah Zarah54b:8 | The Gemara explains: The source of this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>idol worship</b> is <b>that</b> ruling <b>which we said</b> earlier. With regard to the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, the source is <b>as it is written: “For it is a Jubilee Year; it shall be sacred for you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12). The verse juxtaposes the Jubilee Year, the produce of which has the same status as produce of the Sabbatical Year, and sacred items. Infer from this that <b>just as</b> when one buys <b>consecrated</b> property it <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> the money is <b>prohibited, so too,</b> the produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> the money is <b>prohibited.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:12 | about which it is written: “It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you” | Kiddushin 53a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>But there is</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>about which it is written: “It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12)? <b>And we learned</b> by inferring from a mishna (50b) that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year, the verse writes “holy,” <b>but “to the Lord” is not written with regard to it.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:12 | is written: “It is a Jubilee” | Kiddushin 58a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that any two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. <b>But according to the one who says that they do teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases, <b>what can be said?</b> Why is it not learned from these examples that money received from the sale of an item from which benefit is forbidden, is likewise forbidden? The Gemara answers: Expressions of <b>restriction are written</b> in both cases. <b>Here,</b> with regard to idol worship, it <b>is written: “For it is banned”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), which indicates only that it is banned, i.e., has its prohibition extend to money received from its sale, while other prohibited items are not. <b>And there,</b> with regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year, it <b>is written: “It is a Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:12), which teaches that with regard to <b>“it,” yes,</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies; but this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply to <b>anything else.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:12 | “It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you” | Kiddushin 58a:9 | The Gemara clarifies: The source indicating that this is true of an object of <b>idol worship</b> is <b>what we said. What is</b> the source indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year? The verse states: <b>“It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12), from which it is derived: <b>Just as consecrated property transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed, <b>so too,</b> produce of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, which has the same status as the Jubilee Year, <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which it is redeemed. Consequently, money used to acquire the produce of the Sabbatical Year will be subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> as the produce itself. |
| Leviticus 25:12 | as it is written: “For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated | Sukkah 40b:4 | <b>What is the rationale for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “In this year of Jubilee</b> you shall return every man unto his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> it is written: <b>“And if you sell an item</b> to your neighbor” (Leviticus 25:14); this indicates that in the Jubilee Year, during which the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year are in effect, one deconsecrates the produce <b>by means of purchase and not by means of redemption.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the rationale for</b> his opinion? It is <b>as it is written: “For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated</b> unto you” (Leviticus 25:12); this indicates that <b>just as</b> one redeems <b>consecrated</b> items <b>both by means of purchase and by means of redemption, so too, Sabbatical-Year</b> produce can be redeemed <b>both by means of purchase and by means of redemption.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:12 | “For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated | Sukkah 40b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Elazar, what does he do with this verse</b> from <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> derived his opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it</b> to derive <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated</b> unto you” (Leviticus 25:12); <b>just as</b> the sanctity of <b>consecrated</b> items <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>they</b> are redeemed, <b>so too,</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>it</b> is redeemed. |
| Leviticus 25:13 | sell his movable property, as it is stated: “In this Jubilee Year you shall return every man to his possession” | Arakhin 30b:4 | Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, continues: If <b>a person has commercial dealings with produce</b> of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year or of the Jubilee Year, <b>ultimately</b> he will become so poor that <b>he will</b> be compelled to <b>sell his movable property, as it is stated: “In this Jubilee Year you shall return every man to his possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and it is written</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“And if you sell something to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand,”</b> which is referring to <b>an item acquired</b> by passing it <b>from hand to hand.</b> The juxtaposition of the two verses indicates that if one violates the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year or the Sabbatical Year, he will eventually have to sell his movable property. |
| Leviticus 25:13 | you shall return | Arakhin 31b:14 | <b>The Sages said to Rav Pappa, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> said <b>to Rav Pappa: But</b> consider the case <b>of the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>as it is written:</b> “In this year of Jubilee <b>you shall return</b> every man unto his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), and the Sages teach that this verse serves <b>to include the gift, and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Meir does not include</b> a gift. <b>Rather, this</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>certainly not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:13 | “you shall return” | Bekhorot 52b:7 | The mishna further teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The halakhic status of <b>a gift</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a sale,</b> and must be returned. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers that the term <b>“you shall return”</b> in the verse: “In the Jubilee Year you shall return every man to his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), is superfluous, as it is already stated: “It shall be a Jubilee for you, and you shall return every man to his possession” (Leviticus 25:10). Therefore, this term serves <b>to include a gift,</b> which is also returned in the Jubilee Year. |

| Leviticus 25:14 | you shall not exploit | Bava Metzia51a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that both the buyer and the seller are subject to the <i>halakha</i> of exploitation? <b>As the Sages taught</b> concerning the verse: <b>“And if you sell to your colleague an item that is sold,</b> or acquire from your colleague’s hand, <b>you shall not exploit</b> his brother” (Leviticus 25:14). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case <b>where a buyer was exploited.

| Leviticus 25:14 | “And if you sell to your colleague an item that is sold, or acquire from your colleague’s hand, | Bava Metzia56b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> It is written: <b>“And if you sell to your colleague an item that is sold, or acquire from your colleague’s hand,</b> one shall not exploit his brother” (Leviticus 25:14).

The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> In that case, one sold paper, and it is no different from any other movable property. The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana, who says: There is no exploitation for</b> cases involving <b><i>perutot</i>,</b> as paper is sold for mere <i>perutot</i>. The Sages therefore <b>teach us: There is exploitation for</b> cases involving <b><i>perutot</i>.

| Leviticus 25:14 | “And if you sell to your colleague an item that is sold, or acquire from your colleague’s hand, | Bava Metzia58b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall not mistreat [<i>tonu</i>] one man his colleague;</b> and you shall fear your God, for I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 25:17). The <i>tanna</i> explains: <b>The verse is speaking with regard to verbal mistreatment.</b> The <i>baraita</i> proceeds: Do <b>you say</b> that it is speaking of <b>verbal mistreatment [<i>be’ona’at devarim</i>], or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> speaking <b>only with regard to monetary exploitation [<i>be’ona’at mammon</i>]?

How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall not mistreat one man his colleague”?</b> It is <b>with regard to verbal mistreatment.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:14 | “Or buy of your counterpart’s hand” | Bekhorot 13a:18 | <b>Rather, Abaye says</b> that the term: Their laws, is referring to <b>their laws that the Torah prescribed for their</b> methods of purchase, by stating: <b>“Or buy of your counterpart’s hand”</b> (Leviticus 25:14), which teaches that <b>it is</b> only <b>from the hand of your counterpart,</b> i.e., a Jew, <b>that</b> property <b>is</b> acquired <b>by</b> the formal act of acquisition of <b>pulling.</b> This indicates that acquiring property <b>from the hand of a gentile</b> is accomplished <b>through</b> payment of <b>money.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:14 | “And if you sell a sale item to your counterpart” | Bekhorot 13a:23 | This can be rejected, as the acquisition of <b>a Jew from a Jew will prove</b> that the inference is not valid, as the <b>person</b> of a Hebrew slave <b>one acquires with money, while the property</b> of a Jew can be acquired only <b>by pulling. Rather, Abaye said:</b> That which it states, that a gentile purchases an animal with money <b>according to their laws,</b> means: With the acts of acquisition <b>that the Torah prescribed</b> to gentiles, the manner in which they acquire items from Jews, i.e., with money, as it is stated: <b>“And if you sell a sale item to your counterpart”</b> (Leviticus 25:14), from which it may be inferred: <b>To your counterpart,</b> i.e., a Jew, property <b>is</b> acquired <b>by pulling,</b> but property <b>from the hand of a gentile</b> is acquired <b>with money.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:14 | said | Bekhorot 13b:4 | The Sages <b>said</b> in explanation: The phrase “of your counterpart” does not teach a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the method of acquisition. Rather, it is referring to the latter part of the verse: “And if you make a sale to your counterpart, or buy of your counterpart’s hand, a man shall not exploit his brother” (Leviticus 25:14). The verse is derived as follows: <b>You</b> must <b>return</b> the sum of <b>exploitation to your counterpart, but you do not</b> need to <b>return</b> the sum of <b>exploitation to a gentile.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: The exemption from returning the sum of exploitation <b>to a gentile is derived from</b> the latter part of the verse alone: <b>“A man shall not exploit his brother.”</b> A gentile is not included in the category of “his brother.” Accordingly, the phrase “of your counterpart” remains extraneous. |
| Leviticus 25:14 | “And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand” | Kiddushin 20a:17 | If <b>a person has commercial dealings with Sabbatical-</b>Year <b>produce,</b> which is prohibited, <b>ultimately</b> he will become so poor that <b>he will</b> have to <b>sell his movable property, as it is stated: “In</b> this <b>Jubilee Year you shall return every man to his land”</b> (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand”</b> (Leviticus 25:14), which is referring to <b>an item acquired</b> by passing it <b>from hand to hand.</b> This teaches that if one sins with regard to the Jubilee Year or the Sabbatical Year, which have many identical <i>halakhot</i>, he will eventually have to sell his movable property. |
| Leviticus 25:14 | As it is written: “And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand” | Kiddushin 26a:11 | § The mishna teaches that property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired only by pulling.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand”</b> (Leviticus 25:14).

The Merciful One states:</b> “Then let him count the years of its sale, and restore the extra to the man to whom he sold it; <b>and it shall return to its ancestral</b> heritage” (Leviticus 25:27). This includes only land, which remains forever, <b>and not trees,</b> which have a limited lifespan. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | the number of years of the crops | Arakhin 14b:8 | Furthermore, Rav Pappa says: If one <b>sold</b> fields that are <b>rocky</b> and unsuitable for planting, <b>they may be redeemed</b> from the purchaser <b>in</b> even <b>less than two years,</b> despite the fact that normally land must be left in the hands of the purchaser for at least two years (see 29b), as derived from the plural term “years of the crops” cited below. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to <b>the number of years of the crops</b> he shall sell it to you” (Leviticus 25:15), <b>and these</b> rocky fields <b>are not fit for crops.</b> But if <b>he did not redeem them</b> from the purchaser, <b>they return to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year, like ancestral fields. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “Then let him count the years of its sale, and restore the extra to the man to whom he sold it; <b>and it shall return to its ancestral</b> heritage” (Leviticus 25:27), <b>and this</b> rocky field <b>is also</b> part of his <b>ancestral</b> heritage. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | that it is written: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Arakhin 18b:10 | The Gemara states: Concerning the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> this is derived from the fact <b>that it is written: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, there are <b>times when a person</b> might <b>eat three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchased a field at the end of the calendar year when its yield had not yet been harvested, and he harvested that yield and subsequently grew and harvested two more crops before the completion of two whole years from the sale, he would have eaten three yields in less than two years. This is not possible if one follows the calendar years, as a new year would start soon after the purchase. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | with regard to an ancestral field, | Arakhin 18b:7 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “sheep in their first year” (Numbers 28:3); and the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which time it is permitted to redeem a sold house in a walled city (Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one may not yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (Leviticus 25:15); <b>and</b> the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> (Exodus 21:2); <b>and similarly,</b> the years stated <b>with regard to a son and with regard to a daughter,</b> as explained below; <b>all of</b> these are calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the start of the period <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the end of the period, i.e., these periods are units of whole years; they do not expire on predetermined dates, such as at the end of the calendar year. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | as it is stated: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Arakhin 29b:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells his field during a period</b> when <b>the Jubilee</b> Year is in effect <b>is not permitted to redeem it less than two years</b> after the sale, <b>as it is stated: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form “years” indicates a minimum of two years. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | a positive mitzva, as it is written: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Arakhin 29b:4 | The Gemara continues: <b>And it is not necessary</b> to state this with regard to the <b>seller, as he stands in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva, as it is written: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), and the plural form “years” indicates a minimum of two years. <b>Rather, even</b> the <b>buyer stands in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva, as we require</b> the fulfillment of another mitzva from the same verse: “According to the number of <b>years</b> after the Jubilee Year <b>you shall buy</b> from your neighbor,” <b>and</b> if the buyer returns the field before the two years elapse, the mitzva <b>is not</b> fulfilled. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | years after the Jubilee you shall buy | Arakhin 29b:8 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “According to the number of <b>years after the Jubilee you shall buy</b> from your neighbor” (Leviticus 25:15). The term: After the Jubilee, <b>teaches that</b> a field <b>may be sold</b> in the year <b>adjacent to the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>From where</b> is it derived that a field may be sold in a year that is <b>separated from the Jubilee</b> Year? <b>The verse states: “According to the multitude of the years</b> you shall increase the price thereof, <b>and according to the fewness of the years</b> you shall diminish the price of it” (Leviticus 25:16). The verse teaches that one may sell a field even after several years have elapsed since the last Jubilee Year. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | for you? The verse states: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Arakhin 30a:6 | § The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If the owner of the field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer before Rosh HaShana and the field was full of produce, and the owner redeems the field after two years, the buyer consumes three crops of the field’s produce in two years. With regard to this <i>halakha</i> <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the owner of the field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer <b>before Rosh HaShana full of produce, that</b> the seller <b>should not say to</b> the buyer when he redeems the field after two years: <b>Leave</b> the field <b>for me</b> full of produce <b>in the manner that I left</b> it <b>for you? The verse states: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), indicating that the payment is calculated according to the number of years, not according to the number of crops. Consequently, <b>sometimes a person consumes three crops in two years.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:15 | “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Arakhin 33b:16 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The priests and the Levites may sell</b> their fields and houses <b>always and may redeem</b> them <b>always.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32)? <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to the ancestral field of an Israelite: <b>“According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), from which it is derived that one cannot redeem an ancestral field less than two years after its sale, one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who sold his field. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> which teaches that a Levite may redeem his field immediately. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | “According to the numbers of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Bava Metzia106a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There,</b> the case with regard to the sold field <b>is different, as the verse states</b> with regard to the sale and leasing of fields: <b>“According to the numbers of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), which is referring to <b>years in which there is produce</b> harvested <b>in the world.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:15 | “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Gittin 48b:1 | <b>“According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), meaning that it is not the field itself that is sold, but rather, what is sold is the right to consume the produce for a specific number of years. |
| Leviticus 25:15 | of years of the crops he shall sell to you” | Niddah 48a:1 | <b>of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, <b>sometimes you</b> might <b>sell three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchases a field in the summer, when the produce has not yet been harvested, and he harvests that yield and subsequently grows and harvests two more crops before the completion of the whole two years, he will have gained three yields in less than two years. |
| Leviticus 25:16 | and according to the fewness of the years | Arakhin 29b:8 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “According to the number of <b>years after the Jubilee you shall buy</b> from your neighbor” (Leviticus 25:15). The term: After the Jubilee, <b>teaches that</b> a field <b>may be sold</b> in the year <b>adjacent to the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>From where</b> is it derived that a field may be sold in a year that is <b>separated from the Jubilee</b> Year? <b>The verse states: “According to the multitude of the years</b> you shall increase the price thereof, <b>and according to the fewness of the years</b> you shall diminish the price of it” (Leviticus 25:16). The verse teaches that one may sell a field even after several years have elapsed since the last Jubilee Year. |
| Leviticus 25:17 | And with regard to any matter given to the heart, it is stated: “And you shall fear your God” | Bava Metzia58b:10 | Likewise, <b>if donkey drivers are asking</b> to purchase <b>grain from</b> someone, and he has none, <b>he may not say to them: Go to so-and-so, as he sells grain, if he knows about him that he never sold</b> grain at all. He thereby causes the donkey drivers and the would-be seller anguish. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even cast his eyes on the merchandise</b> for sale, creating the impression that he is interested, <b>at a time when he does not have money</b> to purchase it. Verbal mistreatment is not typically obvious, and it is difficult to ascertain the intent of the offender, <b>as the matter is given to the heart</b> of each individual, as only he knows what his intention was when he spoke. <b>And with regard to any matter given to the heart, it is stated: “And you shall fear your God”</b> (Leviticus 25:17), as God is privy to the intent of the heart. |
| Leviticus 25:17 | “And you shall not mistreat [ tonu ] one man his colleague; | Bava Metzia58b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall not mistreat [<i>tonu</i>] one man his colleague;</b> and you shall fear your God, for I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 25:17). The <i>tanna</i> explains: <b>The verse is speaking with regard to verbal mistreatment.</b> The <i>baraita</i> proceeds: Do <b>you say</b> that it is speaking of <b>verbal mistreatment [<i>be’ona’at devarim</i>], or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> speaking <b>only with regard to monetary exploitation [<i>be’ona’at mammon</i>]?

How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall not mistreat one man his colleague”?</b> It is <b>with regard to verbal mistreatment.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:17 | which is written: “And you shall not mistreat each man his colleague [ amito ]” | Bava Metzia59a:4 | § <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rav Idi, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And you shall not mistreat each man his colleague [<i>amito</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:17)? The word <i>amito</i> is interpreted as a contraction of <i>im ito</i>, meaning: One who is with him. <b>With</b> one who is <b>with you in</b> observance of <b>Torah and mitzvot, you shall not mistreat</b> him. <b>Rav says: A person must always be careful about mistreatment of his wife.

| Leviticus 25:17 | “And you shall not mistreat, each man his colleague” | Bava Metzia59b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to verbal <b>mistreatment, that three prohibitions are written</b> concerning it: <b>“And you shall neither mistreat a convert”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And when a convert lives in your land, you shall not mistreat him”</b> (Leviticus 19:33); <b>“And you shall not mistreat, each man his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 25:17), <b>and a convert is</b> included in the category of <b>colleague?</b> With regard to <b>one who also oppresses</b> a convert <b>as well, three</b> prohibitions <b>are written:</b> “And you shall neither mistreat a convert, <b>nor oppress him”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And you shall not oppress a convert</b> (Exodus 23:9); <b>“And you shall not be to him like a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24). This last prohibition is a general prohibition, <b>in which converts are included.</b> Consequently, it is not correct that one who oppresses a convert violates only two prohibitions. <b>Rather, both this</b> one, who verbally mistreats a convert, <b>and that</b> one, who oppresses him, <b>violate three prohibitions.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:17 | fraud against him, | Ketubot 84a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rav</b> actually <b>hold</b> that if one stipulates counter to Torah law, <b>his condition is valid? But it was stated: One who says to another:</b> I am selling this to you <b>on the condition that you have no</b> claim of <b>fraud against me,</b> i.e., though there is a prohibition against fraud by Torah law, the purchaser agrees to forgo his right to register a complaint on this basis. <b>Rav said: He does have</b> the right to a claim of <b>fraud against him,</b> and therefore the seller must reimburse the purchaser, as he cannot abrogate the Torah prohibition “And you shall not wrong one another” (Leviticus 25:17). <b>And Shmuel said: He does not have</b> the right to a claim of <b>fraud against him.</b> It is evident from here that according to Rav, one cannot make a stipulation that contradicts Torah law. |
| Leviticus 25:20 | Behold, we may not sow, nor gather our crops” | Pesachim 51b:3 | <b>The Gemara comments: And both</b> Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis, who disagree in this case, hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, “And if you shall say: What shall we eat in the seventh year? <b>Behold, we may not sow, nor gather our crops”</b> (Leviticus 25:20). <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And since they cannot sow, from where would they gather?</b> Why does the verse mention gathering? It is derived <b>from here that</b> gathering <b>after-growths</b> that were not planted but grew on their own <b>is prohibited.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:21 | state: “And it shall bring forth produce for the three years” | Nedarim 61a:6 | Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> There is a difficulty <b>according to your statement</b> as well. <b>Doesn’t</b> the verse <b>state: “And it shall bring forth produce for the three years”</b> (Leviticus 25:21)? The Torah promises the Jewish people that in the year preceding the Sabbatical Year, the land will bring forth enough produce to last for the duration of that year, for the Sabbatical Year, and for part of the following year, until the new produce grows. However, in the case of the Jubilee, <b>there are four</b> years to account for, as agricultural labor is prohibited in the forty-ninth year, which is a Sabbatical Year, and in the following year, which is the Jubilee Year. |
| Leviticus 25:21 | “And it shall bring forth fruit for the three years” | Rosh Hashanah13a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that the years for produce follow the first third of its growth? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it shall bring forth fruit for the three years”</b> (Leviticus 25:21); |
| Leviticus 25:22 | “And you shall eat of the produce of the old store” | Bava Batra91b:13 | § Since the Gemara has discussed times of famine in Eretz Yisrael, it concludes the chapter with a blessing of times of prosperity: <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse states: <b>“And you shall eat of the produce of the old store”</b> (Leviticus 25:22), referring to the produce grown in the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle, this means <b>without <i>salmanton</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Without <i>salmanton</i>? Rav Naḥman said: Without worms [<i>retzinta</i>]</b> that consume the produce, <b>and Rav Sheshet said: Without blight,</b> which destroys the taste of the produce. |
| Leviticus 25:22 | the old store, | Bava Batra91b:14 | The Gemara notes: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheshet,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman:</b> From the verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, <b>and you shall eat</b> of the produce of <b>the old store,</b> until the ninth year” (Leviticus 25:22), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the Jewish people will wait for the new</b> produce <b>because the old store has</b> been <b>destroyed.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Until its produce comes in,”</b> to indicate that they will not stop eating the old produce <b>until the</b> new <b>produce comes of itself,</b> i.e., until it is fully ripe and they do not need the old produce. The old produce will last until then and will not become worm infested, as stated by Rav Naḥman. |
| Leviticus 25:22 | It is written in another verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old produce until the ninth year” | Rosh Hashanah13b:2 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the phrase <b>is necessary for</b> the meaning of the verse <b>itself,</b> to teach that the sixth year will be blessed so that it yields three years’ worth of produce. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written in another verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old produce until the ninth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:22), so that the latter verse teaches about the three years’ worth of produce, and the first verse is available to derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one-third growth. |
| Leviticus 25:23 | in perpetuity [ letzmitut ]; | Arakhin 15b:7 | <b>And Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech</b> will be afflicted by <b>leprous marks coming upon him, as it is stated: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him [<i>atzmit</i>];</b> whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him” (Psalms 101:5). <b>And it is written there:</b> “And the land shall not be sold <b>in perpetuity [<i>letzmitut</i>];</b> for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and settlers with Me” (Leviticus 25:23). <b>And we translate</b> this term <i>letzmitut</i> as <b><i>laḥalutin</i>,</b> in perpetuity or confirmed. |
| Leviticus 25:23 | a contractor? The Merciful One states: “Permanently” | Bava Metzia109a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> this is difficult; <b>does</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>release</b> the term of <b>a contractor? The Merciful One states: “Permanently”</b> (Leviticus 25:23), which indicates that only land that was permanently sold returns to its owner, whereas land that was rented does not revert to the owner at the Jubilee Year. <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> reads as follows: In the case of <b>one who purchases a field from another and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrives,</b> the court <b>appraises</b> it <b>for him.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:23 | As it is stated: “And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity” | Bava Metzia79a:12 | The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he purchased</b> the field <b>for sixty years. As Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Ketina says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who sells his field for sixty years</b> or any fixed length of time, <b>that it does not return</b> to its original owner <b>in</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year? <b>As it is stated: “And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity”</b> (Leviticus 25:23). This prohibition applies to land <b>which,</b> if <b>there</b> were <b>no Jubilee</b> Year, <b>would be</b> sold <b>in perpetuity,</b> but as <b>there is a Jubilee</b> Year it <b>is not</b> sold <b>in perpetuity.</b> That <b>excludes this</b> case, where the field is sold for a fixed length of time, <b>as even though there is no Jubilee</b> Year <b>it is not</b> sold <b>in perpetuity.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:23 | as it is stated: “For the land is Mine” | Gittin 47a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba says: Even though a gentile has no</b> capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to</b> cause the <b>abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce, <b>as it is stated: “For the land is Mine”</b> (Leviticus 25:23), which teaches: <b>The sanctity of the land is Mine,</b> and it is not abrogated when the land is sold to a gentile; <b>a gentile does have, however,</b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael</b> to allow him <b>to dig pits, ditches, and caves</b> in the land he has purchased, <b>as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth has He given to the children of men”</b> (Psalms 115:16). |
| Leviticus 25:23 | in perpetuity [ litzmitut ]” | Sanhedrin 106b:17 | Where is the allusion to leprosy in this verse? <b>It is written there:</b> “And the land shall not be sold <b>in perpetuity [<i>litzmitut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:23), <b>and we translate</b> it into Aramaic as: <b><i>Laḥalutin</i>. And we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to lepers (<i>Megilla</i> 8b): <b>The difference between a quarantined</b> leper, i.e., one examined by a priest who found his symptoms to be inconclusive, and who must therefore remain in isolation for a period of up to two weeks to see if conclusive symptoms develop; <b>and a confirmed [<i>muḥlat</i>]</b> leper, i.e., one whose symptoms were conclusive and the priest declared him a confirmed leper, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>letting</b> the hair on one’s head <b>grow and rending</b> one’s garments. The derivation is based on the etymological similarity between <i>hitzmatta</i> and <i>litzmitut</i>; the translation of <i>litzmitut</i> as <i>laḥalutin</i>, and the etymological similarity between <i>laḥalutin</i> and <i>muḥlat</i>. |
| Leviticus 25:24 | you shall grant redemption | Kiddushin 21a:11 | Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana <b>raised an objection to</b> the ruling of Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the verse: “And <b>in all</b> of your ancestral land <b>you shall grant redemption</b> for the land” (Leviticus 25:24). This verse serves <b>to include houses and a Hebrew slave. What, is it not</b> correct to say that the term houses is referring to <b>houses of walled cities,</b> indicating that they can also be redeemed by relatives? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is referring to <b>houses in open areas</b> without walls. |
| Leviticus 25:24 | That | Kiddushin 21a:12 | The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>houses in open areas</b> without walls, <b>it is explicitly written: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31), meaning that they are like ancestral fields. If so, there is no need for another verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse: “And in all of your ancestral land you shall grant redemption for the land” (Leviticus 25:24), serves <b>to establish</b> that redemption by relatives is <b>an obligation, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:24 | you shall grant redemption | Kiddushin 21a:14 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that when the verse states: <b>“And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold,”</b> this redemption is <b>an obligation.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is <b>an obligation, or is it only optional? The verse states:</b> “And <b>in all</b> of your ancestral land <b>you shall grant redemption</b> for the land” (Leviticus 25:24). Here <b>the verse established it as obligatory.</b> This is the interpretation of the verses according to Rabbi Eliezer. |
| Leviticus 25:24 | you shall grant redemption | Kiddushin 21a:20 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: “And <b>in all</b> of your ancestral land <b>you shall grant redemption</b> for the land” (Leviticus 25:24). The inclusive expression “in all” serves <b>to include houses and a Hebrew slave. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this includes <b>houses of walled cities and a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew?</b> The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> one can say that this is referring to <b>a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:25 | “If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his ancestral land” | Arakhin 30b:5 | If <b>he does not feel</b> remorse and he does not repent, <b>ultimately he will</b> be compelled to <b>sell his fields, as it is stated</b> in an adjacent verse: <b>“If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25). |
| Leviticus 25:25 | “If your brother grows poor and sells of his ancestral land” | Kiddushin 20a:18 | If one <b>does not sense</b> that he is being punished and does not repent, <b>ultimately he</b> will have to <b>sell his fields, as it is stated</b> in an adjacent verse: <b>“If your brother grows poor and sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> have to <b>sell his house, as it is stated:</b> “And if a man <b>sells a dwelling-house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). |
| Leviticus 25:25 | “And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold” | Kiddushin 21a:13 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a verse that deals with one who sells ancestral land: <b>“And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), this redemption is <b>optional,</b> i.e., if he wishes to do so he may redeem the land. Do <b>you say</b> that it is <b>optional or is it nothing other</b> than <b>an obligation? The verse states</b> concerning an ancestral field that was sold: <b>“And if a man has no one to redeem it”</b> (Leviticus 25:26). This verse is puzzling: <b>But is there a man in Israel who does not have redeemers?</b> Every Jew has a relative of some sort, even if he must trace his family tree back all the way to Jacob. <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to <b>one who has</b> a relative <b>who does not want to purchase,</b> i.e., redeem, the land, <b>as he has permission</b> to refrain from doing so, since this redemption is optional. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:25 | it is written: “And sells of his ancestral land” | Kiddushin 9a:8 | <b>Rava said: There,</b> in the case of a sale, the formulation of the document is taken <b>from the context of the verse, and here,</b> in the case of betrothal, the formulation of the document is likewise taken <b>from the context of the verse.</b> Rava elaborates: <b>There,</b> with regard to a sale, <b>it is written: “And sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), which indicates that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the transaction <b>dependent on the seller. Here, it is written: “If</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 22:13), meaning that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the betrothal <b>dependent on the husband.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:26 | a Hebrew slave | Arakhin 30a:16 | The Gemara responds: Such a possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as it is learned</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“redemption”</b> written in this context and <b>“redemption” from</b> the passage discussing <b>a Hebrew slave</b> that the Torah is lenient with regard to the redeemer. The verse states with regard to the redemption of a field: “And he prospers and finds sufficient means to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26), and with regard to the redemption of a slave who was sold to a gentile, the verse states: “After he is sold he shall attain redemption” (Leviticus 25:48). Accordingly, just as the Torah is lenient with regard to the redemption of a Hebrew slave, so too the Torah is lenient with regard to redeeming a field. |
| Leviticus 25:26 | As the Sages taught | Arakhin 30b:17 | § The mishna teaches: One <b>may not sell</b> his ancestral field that is located <b>in a distant</b> area and redeem with that money a field that he sold in a nearby area. Likewise, he may not sell a low-quality field and redeem with that money a high-quality field. And he may not borrow money and redeem the field, nor may he redeem the field incrementally, half now and half at a later date. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And he prospers and finds sufficient means to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26), the phrase <b>“and he prospers”</b> teaches that the money he uses to redeem the field must be <b>his own possession,</b> meaning <b>that he may not borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field. |
| Leviticus 25:26 | “ ge’ullato ” | Kiddushin 20b:13 | <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet</b> with regard to a similar topic: In the case of <b>one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities,</b> which can be redeemed only during the first year after the sale, can it <b>be partially redeemed, or can it not be partially redeemed?</b> The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Does he <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:29) and <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:26) <b>from</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> and say that <b>just as ancestral land cannot be partially redeemed, so too, this</b> house <b>cannot be partially redeemed?</b> |
| Leviticus 25:26 | it revealed | Kiddushin 20b:14 | <b>Or perhaps</b> one should say: In a case <b>where</b> the verse explicitly <b>revealed</b> that it cannot be redeemed partially, as it does in the context of an ancestral field, <b>it revealed</b> it. With regard to one who redeems an ancestral field, it is written: “And he becomes rich and finds sufficient means to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26), indicating that he has enough money to redeem the whole field, not part of it. By contrast, in a case <b>where</b> the Torah <b>did not reveal</b> that it cannot be redeemed, <b>it did not reveal</b> it, and therefore a house from a walled city can be partially redeemed, as the verse does not state this condition in that context. |
| Leviticus 25:26 | redeem it [ ge’ullato ]” | Kiddushin 20b:8 | The Gemara analyzes the sides of the dilemma: With regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile, the verse states: “According to his years he shall give back the price of <b>his redemption [<i>ge’ullato</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:52), and the meaning of the term “<i>ge’ullato</i>” can be <b>derived from</b> the same term stated with regard to the redemption of an ancestral field: “And he becomes rich and finds sufficient means to <b>redeem it [<i>ge’ullato</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:26). Accordingly, <b>just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed,</b> but is either fully redeemed or not at all, <b>so too, this</b> slave <b>cannot be partially redeemed. Or perhaps we say</b> that he cannot be partially redeemed only if that leads <b>to a leniency,</b> but <b>we do not say</b> that he cannot be redeemed if it leads <b>to a stringency.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:26 | “And if a man has no one to redeem it” | Kiddushin 21a:13 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a verse that deals with one who sells ancestral land: <b>“And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), this redemption is <b>optional,</b> i.e., if he wishes to do so he may redeem the land. Do <b>you say</b> that it is <b>optional or is it nothing other</b> than <b>an obligation? The verse states</b> concerning an ancestral field that was sold: <b>“And if a man has no one to redeem it”</b> (Leviticus 25:26). This verse is puzzling: <b>But is there a man in Israel who does not have redeemers?</b> Every Jew has a relative of some sort, even if he must trace his family tree back all the way to Jacob. <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to <b>one who has</b> a relative <b>who does not want to purchase,</b> i.e., redeem, the land, <b>as he has permission</b> to refrain from doing so, since this redemption is optional. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:26 | “ ge’ullato ” | Kiddushin 21a:9 | The Gemara discusses a similar matter. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, can</b> it <b>be redeemed by relatives or can</b> it <b>not be redeemed by relatives?</b> Is the ability to redeem a house limited to the seller himself? The Gemara presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:29) and <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:26) <b>from an ancestral field</b> in this manner: <b>Just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed and</b> yet it <b>can be redeemed by relatives, so too, this</b> house <b>also cannot be partially redeemed and</b> yet <b>it can be redeemed by relatives?</b> |
| Leviticus 25:26 | raises a contradiction | Makkot 8a:11 | The Gemara asks: Is that <b>to say that</b> the term <b>“and finds” indicates</b> an item that was there <b>initially,</b> prior to the incident in question? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from that which is written with regard to one who seeks to redeem an ancestral field that he sold: “And he acquires the means and finds sufficient funds for his redemption” (Leviticus 25:26). The term <b>“and finds”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> one who, in order to accrue funds to redeem his field, sells a field that was <b>found</b> in his possession when he originally sold the field. It means <b>that he may not sell</b> land that he owns <b>in a distant</b> place <b>and redeem</b> land that he owns <b>in a proximate</b> place, or sell <b>a low-quality</b> tract of land <b>and redeem with</b> the funds accrued from that sale <b>high-quality</b> land. One may not exploit his right to redeem his land for his own advantage. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the term “and finds” indicates an item that was not there at the time but presents itself later. |
| Leviticus 25:27 | and it shall return to its ancestral | Arakhin 14b:10 | Rav Pappa also says: If one <b>sold trees</b> of his ancestral field, <b>they may not be redeemed</b> from the purchaser if <b>less than two years</b> passed. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy it from your neighbor, and according to the number of <b>years of the crops</b> he shall sell it to you” (Leviticus 25:15), <b>and these</b> trees <b>are fit for crops,</b> as they produce fruit. But if <b>he did not redeem them</b> from the purchaser, the trees <b>do not return to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “Then let him count the years of its sale, and restore the extra to the man to whom he sold it; <b>and it shall return to its ancestral</b> heritage” (Leviticus 25:27). This includes only land, which remains forever, <b>and not trees,</b> which have a limited lifespan. |
| Leviticus 25:27 | and it shall return to its ancestral | Arakhin 14b:8 | Furthermore, Rav Pappa says: If one <b>sold</b> fields that are <b>rocky</b> and unsuitable for planting, <b>they may be redeemed</b> from the purchaser <b>in</b> even <b>less than two years,</b> despite the fact that normally land must be left in the hands of the purchaser for at least two years (see 29b), as derived from the plural term “years of the crops” cited below. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to <b>the number of years of the crops</b> he shall sell it to you” (Leviticus 25:15), <b>and these</b> rocky fields <b>are not fit for crops.</b> But if <b>he did not redeem them</b> from the purchaser, <b>they return to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year, like ancestral fields. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “Then let him count the years of its sale, and restore the extra to the man to whom he sold it; <b>and it shall return to its ancestral</b> heritage” (Leviticus 25:27), <b>and this</b> rocky field <b>is also</b> part of his <b>ancestral</b> heritage. |
| Leviticus 25:27 | to whom he sold it” | Arakhin 30a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> Consider the case where the owner of a field <b>sold it to the first</b> buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars <b>and the first</b> buyer then <b>sold it to the second</b> buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when the original owner redeems the field, <b>he calculates</b> the payment <b>only</b> according to the price that he set <b>with the first</b> buyer? <b>The verse states:</b> “And he calculates the years of its sale, and he returns the remainder to the man <b>to whom he sold it”</b> (Leviticus 25:27). |
| Leviticus 25:27 | to whom he sold it” | Arakhin 30a:7 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> When the Jubilee Year is in effect, one may sell a field only until the Jubilee Year, at which point the field returns to its original owner. If the owner redeems the field before the Jubilee Year, the payment per annum is calculated by dividing the sale price by the number of years from the sale until the Jubilee Year. The owner returns the per annum payment multiplied by the number of years remaining until the Jubilee Year. If the owner of a field <b>sold it to the first</b> buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars <b>and the first</b> buyer then <b>sold</b> it <b>to the second</b> buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars, when the original owner redeems the field <b>he calculates</b> the payment <b>only</b> according to the price that he set <b>with the first</b> buyer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And he calculates the years of its sale, and he returns the remainder to the man <b>to whom he sold it”</b> (Leviticus 25:27). |
| Leviticus 25:28 | and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession” | Arakhin 29a:16 | <b>And</b> likewise the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a dedicated,</b> i.e., ancestral, <b>field apply only during a period that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “Then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought…<b>and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:28). Finally, the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>houses of walled cities apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations; <b>it shall not go out in the Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). |
| Leviticus 25:29 | year stated with regard to houses of walled cities, | Arakhin 18b:7 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “sheep in their first year” (Numbers 28:3); and the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which time it is permitted to redeem a sold house in a walled city (Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one may not yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (Leviticus 25:15); <b>and</b> the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> (Exodus 21:2); <b>and similarly,</b> the years stated <b>with regard to a son and with regard to a daughter,</b> as explained below; <b>all of</b> these are calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the start of the period <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the end of the period, i.e., these periods are units of whole years; they do not expire on predetermined dates, such as at the end of the calendar year. |
| Leviticus 25:29 | within a whole year after it is sold, | Arakhin 18b:9 | The Gemara continues clarifying the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities</b> is calculated by a whole year and not a calendar year is derived from the fact <b>that it is written:</b> “Then he may redeem it <b>within a whole year after it is sold,</b> for a full year he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). The verse is referring to a year counted from the day <b>of its</b> own <b>sale, and not</b> the <b>year of the counting of the world.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:29 | sell his house, as it is stated: “And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city” | Arakhin 30b:6 | If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he will</b> be compelled to <b>sell his house, as it is stated: “And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the previous clause, <b>where</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>says</b> that the sinner <b>does not sense</b> remorse, <b>and what is different here, where he says</b> that consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him?</b> The Gemara responds: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: Once a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it is permitted to him.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:29 | days | Arakhin 31a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who sells a house in a walled city may redeem it immediately. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The Torah states: “And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the completion of the year after it is sold; for <b>days</b> he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). The word <b>“days”</b> means <b>no fewer than two</b> days, i.e., the house cannot be redeemed during the first two days after the sale. |
| Leviticus 25:29 | “Until the completion of the year after it is sold” | Arakhin 31a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> word <b>“days”?</b> The Gemara answers: The Rabbis <b>require it</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that the year does not conclude with the arrival of Rosh HaShana, at the end of the calendar year; rather, it is calculated <b>from day to day,</b> that is, until the arrival of the date of the sale in the subsequent year. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where does he</b> derive that the year is calculated <b>from day to day?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase: <b>“Until the completion of the year after it is sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). |
| Leviticus 25:29 | the Merciful One states: “And if a man sells a dwelling house | Arakhin 31b:2 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, if <b>the seller died, his son may redeem</b> the house from the buyer. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> as a son inherits his father’s property. The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that when <b>the Merciful One states: “And if a man sells a dwelling house</b> in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the completion of the year after it is sold” (Leviticus 25:29), this indicates that the man who redeems the house must be the same man who sold it, <b>and this</b> son did <b>not sell;</b> therefore, the same verse <b>teaches us: “And he shall have the right of redemption,”</b> indicating that the right of redemption applies <b>in any case,</b> either to the seller or his son. |
| Leviticus 25:29 | “And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city” | Arakhin 33b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>a case like this,</b> where the city was first settled and only then surrounded by a wall, <b>is it</b> considered <b>a wall</b> to the extent that the houses inside the city are considered in a walled city? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). This is referring to a city <b>that was</b> initially <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and was ultimately settled, and not</b> to a city <b>that was</b> first <b>settled and was ultimately surrounded</b> by a wall. |
| Leviticus 25:29 | A year, as it is written: “For days he shall have redemption” | Ketubot 57b:3 | The Gemara first analyzes the language of the verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“days”? If we say two days,</b> the minimum number justifying the use of the plural, does <b>a person</b> really <b>speak like this?</b> Rebecca’s relatives <b>said to</b> Abraham’s servant that they wanted her to stay for <b>two days,</b> after which <b>he said to them no,</b> as he did not want to wait even that long. If so, is it possible that after that <b>they said to him</b> that they wanted her to stay for <b>ten days?</b> Consequently, it is impossible to explain the word “days” as two days and “ten” as ten days. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>“days”?</b> It means: <b>A year, as it is written: “For days he shall have redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:29), and there it is explained that “days” is referring to a year. Consequently, in the verse <b>“And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten”</b> (Genesis 24:55), “days” refers to a year, and “ten” refers to a shorter period of similar magnitude, i.e. ten months, in order to prepare for her wedding. |
| Leviticus 25:29 | sells a dwelling-house in a walled city” | Kiddushin 20a:18 | If one <b>does not sense</b> that he is being punished and does not repent, <b>ultimately he</b> will have to <b>sell his fields, as it is stated</b> in an adjacent verse: <b>“If your brother grows poor and sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> have to <b>sell his house, as it is stated:</b> “And if a man <b>sells a dwelling-house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). |
| Leviticus 25:29 | “ ge’ullato ” | Kiddushin 20b:13 | <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet</b> with regard to a similar topic: In the case of <b>one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities,</b> which can be redeemed only during the first year after the sale, can it <b>be partially redeemed, or can it not be partially redeemed?</b> The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Does he <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:29) and <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:26) <b>from</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> and say that <b>just as ancestral land cannot be partially redeemed, so too, this</b> house <b>cannot be partially redeemed?</b> |
| Leviticus 25:29 | “ ge’ullato ” | Kiddushin 21a:9 | The Gemara discusses a similar matter. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, can</b> it <b>be redeemed by relatives or can</b> it <b>not be redeemed by relatives?</b> Is the ability to redeem a house limited to the seller himself? The Gemara presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:29) and <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:26) <b>from an ancestral field</b> in this manner: <b>Just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed and</b> yet it <b>can be redeemed by relatives, so too, this</b> house <b>also cannot be partially redeemed and</b> yet <b>it can be redeemed by relatives?</b> |
| Leviticus 25:29 | What is the reason? As it is written: “And if a man sells a residential house in a walled city” | Megillah 3b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city that was</b> initially <b>settled and</b> only <b>later surrounded</b> by a wall <b>is considered a village</b> rather than a walled city. <b>What is the reason? As it is written: “And if a man sells a residential house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). The wording of the verse indicates that it is referring to a place <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and</b> only <b>later settled, and not</b> to a place <b>that was</b> first <b>settled and</b> only <b>later surrounded</b> by a wall. |
| Leviticus 25:29 | of houses of walled cities, | Nazir 5a:1 | <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>yamim</i></b> stated with regard to Absalom based upon a verbal analogy from the word <b><i>yamim</i></b> that appears in the context <b>of houses of walled cities,</b> where it states: “For a full year [<i>yamim</i>] he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of walled cities, the term <i>yamim</i> means <b>twelve months,</b> as the verse states immediately afterward: “Within the space of a full year” (Leviticus 25:30), <b>so too here,</b> in the case of Absalom, the term <i>yamim</i> means <b>twelve months.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:29 | within a whole year after it is sold, | Niddah 47b:23 | The Gemara further asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities</b> is calculated by a whole year and not by calendar year? <b>The verse states:</b> “Then he may redeem it <b>within a whole year after it is sold,</b> for a full year he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). The verse is referring to a year counted from the day <b>of its</b> own <b>sale, and not the year of the universal count. From where do we</b> derive that the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field</b> are whole years? <b>The verse states:</b> “According the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and <b>according to the number</b> |
| Leviticus 25:30 | it shall not go out in the Jubilee” | Arakhin 29a:16 | <b>And</b> likewise the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a dedicated,</b> i.e., ancestral, <b>field apply only during a period that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “Then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought…<b>and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:28). Finally, the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>houses of walled cities apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations; <b>it shall not go out in the Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). |
| Leviticus 25:30 | year for him, | Arakhin 31a:3 | If <b>the seller died, his son may redeem</b> the house from the buyer. If <b>the buyer died,</b> the seller <b>may redeem</b> it <b>from the possession of</b> the buyer’s <b>son.</b> If the buyer sold the house to another, <b>one calculates</b> the <b>year only from the time that</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the house to the first buyer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if it is not redeemed <b>until the passage of</b> a full <b>year for him,</b> then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30). The term “for him” indicates that the year is calculated from when the initial owner sold the house. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | in perpetuity” | Arakhin 31a:4 | <b>When it says: “A full</b> year,” this serves <b>to include the intercalated month</b> in the year calculated from the sale, if it was a leap year. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word “full” serves <b>to give</b> the seller <b>a year and its addition,</b> i.e., the year during which the house may be redeemed is not the 354-day lunar year, but the 365-day solar year. If the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed,</b> the house has <b>become</b> the property <b>of</b> the buyer <b>in perpetuity.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to both <b>one who buys</b> a house in a walled city <b>and one to whom it is given as a gift, as it is stated:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it <b>in perpetuity”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). |
| Leviticus 25:30 | “a full | Arakhin 31a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where does he</b> derive that the year is calculated <b>from hour to hour?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from</b> the term <b>“a full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30). The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> what do they derive from the term “a full year”? The Gemara responds: The Rabbis <b>require that</b> term <b>to</b> teach that <b>the intercalated month</b> of a leap year is included in the year of sale. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | where it is written: “A full | Arakhin 31b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this</b> second <i>halakha</i>? <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the lambs is identical to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> concerning the houses. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>there,</b> with regard to houses of walled cities, <b>where it is written: “A full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30), this is indeed the <i>halakha</i>, but <b>here,</b> with regard to lambs, <b>where it is not written: A full</b> year, perhaps this is <b>not</b> the case; Rabbi Abba bar Memel therefore <b>teaches us that</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the words <b>“year”</b> and <b>“year”</b> the two cases <b>derive</b> their <i>halakhot</i> <b>from each other.</b> With regard to houses of walled cities, it is written: “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him” (Leviticus 25:30), and it is written with regard to lambs: “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year” (Exodus 12:5). |
| Leviticus 25:30 | When it states: “A full | Arakhin 31b:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>When it states: “A full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30), this serves to include the intercalated month in the year calculated from the sale. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This serves <b>to give</b> the seller <b>a year</b> and <b>its addition.</b> With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“A full year”; Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This means that one <b>counts 365 days, in accordance with the number</b> of <b>days</b> in <b>a solar</b> year, which are eleven more than in a lunar year. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One <b>counts twelve months from day to day, and if</b> an additional month <b>was intercalated</b> into the year, then the month <b>was intercalated to</b> the benefit of the seller, i.e., he has thirteen months to redeem his house. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | was not redeemed, | Arakhin 31b:12 | § The mishna teaches: If the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed,</b> it becomes the property of the buyer in perpetuity. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who buys a house in a walled city and one to whom it is given as a gift, as it is stated: “In perpetuity [<i>latzemitut</i>]” (Leviticus 25:30). With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught: “<i>Latzemitut</i>”</b> means <b>in perpetuity;</b> that is, the seller can no longer redeem the house against the buyer’s will, nor does it return to his possession in the Jubilee Year. <b>Another matter</b> derived from this verse is that <b>“<i>latzemitut</i>”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a house given as <b>a gift. What is the reason,</b> i.e., how is this derived from “<i>latzemitut</i>”? The verse could have stated <b><i>tzemit</i>,</b> but instead it states <b><i>tzemitut</i>.</b> The expanded term serves to include a house given as a gift. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | Shmuel says: As the verse states: | Arakhin 31b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel says: As the verse states:</b> “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him, then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:30). The verse indicates that the house belongs in perpetuity to <b>“the one who bought it,” even</b> if he purchased it <b>from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is the consecrator always capable of redeeming the house from the possession of the Temple treasury? <b>Let it</b> belong to the <b>Temple</b> treasury <b>in perpetuity</b> if it is not redeemed within one year. The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Throughout his generations.” Excluded,</b> therefore, is the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>as</b> it is not a person and it <b>does not have generations.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:30 | of the one who bought it | Arakhin 31b:3 | The mishna further teaches: If <b>the buyer died,</b> the seller <b>may redeem</b> the house <b>from the possession of</b> the buyer’s <b>son.</b> The Gemara asks: This, too, is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession <b>of the one who bought it</b> in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30), <b>and</b> as <b>this</b> son did <b>not buy</b> the house, the buyer cannot redeem it from him; therefore, the previous verse <b>teaches us: “He shall have the right of redemption,”</b> indicating that this right applies <b>in any case,</b> even from the buyer’s son. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | sold | Arakhin 31b:4 | § The mishna teaches that if the buyer sold the house to another, <b>one calculates</b> the <b>year only from the time that</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the house to the first buyer, as it is stated: “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him” (Leviticus 25:30). <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse states <b>“year,” I do not know if</b> one counts the <b>year</b> from when the owner sold it <b>to the first</b> buyer, or <b>if</b> one counts the <b>year</b> from when the first buyer sold it <b>to</b> the <b>second. When</b> the verse <b>states: “Until the passage of a full year for him,” you must</b> say that it is <b>a year</b> from when the owner sold it <b>to the first</b> buyer. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | a wall” | Arakhin 32a:11 | <strong>GEMARA</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that the halakhic status of a house in a city whose rooftops constitute the top of its wall is not like that of the houses of walled cities, <b>the Sages taught:</b> When the verse states: “The house that is in the city that has <b>a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), this is referring specifically to a city that has an actual wall <b>and not</b> merely <b>a wall of roofs.</b> When the next verse states: “But the houses of the villages that have no wall <b>round</b> about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country,” this serves to <b>exclude Tiberias</b> from being considered a walled city, <b>as the sea is its wall</b> on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | house | Arakhin 32a:6 | <strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Then the <b>house</b> that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a house; from where</b> is it derived <b>to include olive presses, bathhouses, towers, dovecotes, pits, ditches, and caves? The verse states: “That is in the</b> walled <b>city,”</b> indicating that anything situated within the city is included. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the fields</b> that are inside the city. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “House,”</b> which excludes a field; it does not resemble a house in any way, since it does not contain any items. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:30 | in perpetuity” | Arakhin 33b:18 | Additionally, <b>since it is stated:</b> “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him, <b>then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession</b> of the one who bought it <b>in perpetuity”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who sold his house in a walled city. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> indicating that the Levite may always redeem his house. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations” | Bava Kamma82b:6 | The Gemara discusses these ten <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to Jerusalem, one by one: <b>A house</b> situated <b>in</b> it does <b>not</b> become <b>irredeemable</b> one year after its sale. The reason is <b>that it is written:</b> “And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then <b>the house</b> that is in the <b>walled</b> city <b>shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any single one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel; rather, it is considered common property. Since no one has ancestral ownership of any house in Jerusalem, its houses cannot be sold permanently. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | “Which has [ lo ] a wall” | Megillah 10b:3 | The Gemara answers: This is a dispute between <b>two</b> later <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who hold <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei.</b> Each transmitted Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion in a different manner. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that one of the traditions is mistaken, as with regard to <b>this</b> statement, <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei said it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said</b> that the verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). The word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, meaning no, that it does not have a wall, but its vocalization is in the sense of its homonym, <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even though it does not presently have</b> a wall, as it was destroyed, <b>but it had a wall previously,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. It is Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, who maintains that the first consecration sanctified Jerusalem forever. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | “Which has [ lo ] a wall | Megillah 3b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said: A</b> walled <b>city that was destroyed and</b> then <b>later settled is considered a city.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term <b>destroyed? If we say</b> that the city’s <b>walls were destroyed,</b> and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi comes to teach us that if it was <b>settled, yes</b> it is treated as a walled city, but if it was <b>not settled,</b> it is <b>not</b> treated that way, there is a difficulty. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Yosei says:</b> The verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall</b> (Leviticus 25:30),” and the word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, which means no, but in context the word <i>lo</i> is used as though it was written with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even though</b> the city <b>does not have</b> a wall <b>now,</b> as the wall was destroyed, if it <b>had</b> a wall <b>before,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | “Which has a wall” | Megillah 5b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why was he uncertain?</b> The sea is <b>certainly not a wall. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the sale of houses in walled cities, the phrase: <b>“Which has a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), indicates that the city has a bona fide wall <b>and not</b> merely <b>a wall of roofs.</b> If a city is completely encircled by attached houses but there is no separate wall, it is not considered a walled city. The next verse, which is referring to cities that have no wall <b>“round about</b> them” (Leviticus 25:31), <b>excludes Tiberias</b> from being considered a walled city, <b>as the sea is its wall</b> on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall. Consequently, Tiberias is not considered a walled city. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | twelve months, | Nazir 5a:1 | <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>yamim</i></b> stated with regard to Absalom based upon a verbal analogy from the word <b><i>yamim</i></b> that appears in the context <b>of houses of walled cities,</b> where it states: “For a full year [<i>yamim</i>] he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of walled cities, the term <i>yamim</i> means <b>twelve months,</b> as the verse states immediately afterward: “Within the space of a full year” (Leviticus 25:30), <b>so too here,</b> in the case of Absalom, the term <i>yamim</i> means <b>twelve months.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:30 | a full year” | Rosh Hashanah6b:8 | The Gemara clarifies again: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>you find</b> a year without three Festivals <b>in a leap year, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of houses of walled cities, with regard to which an owner is given only one year to redeem his home if he sells it, after which it becomes the permanent possession of the purchaser, the verse states: “And if it be not redeemed within the space of <b>a full year”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). How is the year determined? <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One counts 365 days like the number of the days in a solar</b> year, and not the usual lunar year, which is why it is called a full year. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | “Which has [ lo ] a wall” | Shevuot 16a:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei.</b> Each transmitted Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion in a different manner. And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that one of the traditions is mistaken, as <b>one of the</b> <i>baraitot</i> <b>was stated by Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei,</b> and not his brother, Rabbi Yishmael. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei says</b> that the verse with regard to walled cities states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). The word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, meaning no, and accordingly the verse would be stating to the contrary, that the city does not have a wall, but its vocalization is in the sense of its homonym, <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even if it does not presently have</b> a wall <b>but it had</b> a wall <b>previously,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. It is Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei who maintains that the first consecration sanctified the Temple and Jerusalem forever. |
| Leviticus 25:30 | a full year” | Yoma 65b:8 | The Gemara responds: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as it is possible that the goat will not be disqualified, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to redeeming houses in a walled city the Torah states: “And if it not be redeemed within the space of <b>a full year”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), which indicates that <b>he counts 365 days, in accordance with the number</b> of <b>days</b> in a <b>solar year;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: He counts twelve months from day to day.</b> Therefore, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, if the goat was less than eleven days old on the first Yom Kippur, it will not be disqualified on the following Yom Kippur because it will still be less than 365 days old, as long as the first year was not a leap year. Nevertheless, it is disqualified by rabbinic decree due to a concern that other goats would be used in similar circumstances even if they were more than a year old. |
| Leviticus 25:31 | shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; | Arakhin 33a:9 | <strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “But the houses of the courtyards that have no wall round about them <b>shall be reckoned with the fields of the country;</b> they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:31). <b>The verse juxtaposed</b> houses of unwalled courtyards <b>to an ancestral field: Just as an ancestral field leaves</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with</b> a per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price, <b>so too, houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with the</b> per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price. |
| Leviticus 25:31 | which is stated: “The houses of the courtyards” | Arakhin 33b:2 | <strong>GEMARA</strong> <b> The Sages taught: By inference from</b> that <b>which is stated: “The houses of the courtyards”</b> (Leviticus 25:31), <b>do I not know that they have no wall</b> around them? If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Which have no wall”?</b> It means that there are certain places that <b>even though they have a wall,</b> they are considered <b>like</b> places <b>that do not have a wall. And how many,</b> i.e., what is considered such a place? The term <b>“houses”</b> indicates a minimum of <b>two,</b> and the term <b>“courtyards”</b> likewise indicates a minimum of <b>two.</b> Therefore, if a city has only <b>two courtyards</b> each containing <b>two houses,</b> its houses are considered like the houses of the unwalled courtyards. |
| Leviticus 25:31 | it is explicitly written: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country” | Kiddushin 21a:12 | The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>houses in open areas</b> without walls, <b>it is explicitly written: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31), meaning that they are like ancestral fields. If so, there is no need for another verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse: “And in all of your ancestral land you shall grant redemption for the land” (Leviticus 25:24), serves <b>to establish</b> that redemption by relatives is <b>an obligation, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:31 | written explicitly: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country” | Kiddushin 21a:17 | The Gemara asks: But the cases of <b>houses in open areas and</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> are <b>written explicitly: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31). The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> that the verse detailing the redemption by relatives stated with regard to an ancestral field teaches that <b>the closer</b> of a relative one is to the seller, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of redeeming the ancestral field. The obligation or merit to redeem the field applies first to one who is more closely related to the seller. <b>So too,</b> with regard to houses in open areas, this verse teaches that <b>the closer</b> of a relative one is to the seller, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of redeeming the house. |
| Leviticus 25:31 | Concerning houses in open areas and an ancestral field, it is written explicitly: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country” | Kiddushin 21b:2 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “May redeem him,” “may redeem him,”</b> and <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48–49), <b>three times?</b> This serves <b>to include all redemptions,</b> and <b>that they are redeemed in this order. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this inclusion is referring both to <b>houses of walled cities and a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew,</b> that they can be redeemed by relatives? The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> it includes <b>houses in open areas and an ancestral field.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning houses in open areas and an ancestral field, it is written explicitly: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This teaches that <b>the closer</b> of a relative one is to the seller, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of redeeming the house or the field. This is the context of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement. |
| Leviticus 25:31 | “round about | Megillah 5b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why was he uncertain?</b> The sea is <b>certainly not a wall. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the sale of houses in walled cities, the phrase: <b>“Which has a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), indicates that the city has a bona fide wall <b>and not</b> merely <b>a wall of roofs.</b> If a city is completely encircled by attached houses but there is no separate wall, it is not considered a walled city. The next verse, which is referring to cities that have no wall <b>“round about</b> them” (Leviticus 25:31), <b>excludes Tiberias</b> from being considered a walled city, <b>as the sea is its wall</b> on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall. Consequently, Tiberias is not considered a walled city. |
| Leviticus 25:32 | always, as it is stated: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption” | Arakhin 33b:13 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It applies <b>in the cities of the Levites. But in the cities of the Israelites one may render a field</b> an empty <b>lot but not</b> an empty <b>lot a field,</b> and one may incorporate an empty <b>lot</b> into <b>a city but not</b> render part of <b>a city</b> an empty <b>lot,</b> in order to ensure <b>that they will not</b> thereby <b>destroy the cities of Israel. The priests and the Levites may sell</b> their fields and houses <b>always and may redeem</b> them <b>always, as it is stated: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32). Priests are also members of the tribe of Levi. |
| Leviticus 25:32 | that it is written: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption” | Arakhin 33b:15 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: As the verse states: “But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:34). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“may not be sold”? If we say</b> it means that such fields <b>may not be sold at all,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32), one learns <b>by inference that</b> their fields <b>may be sold. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“may not be sold”?</b> It means that a field, an empty lot, or a city <b>may not be changed</b> from its current status. |
| Leviticus 25:32 | the verse state: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption” | Arakhin 33b:16 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The priests and the Levites may sell</b> their fields and houses <b>always and may redeem</b> them <b>always.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32)? <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to the ancestral field of an Israelite: <b>“According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), from which it is derived that one cannot redeem an ancestral field less than two years after its sale, one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who sold his field. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> which teaches that a Levite may redeem his field immediately. |
| Leviticus 25:32 | taught | Arakhin 33b:9 | The Gemara adds that <b>it is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Given that the verse already states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:32), why does the next verse state: <b>“And if a man purchases from the Levites</b>…shall go out during the Jubilee Year”?It is because one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>A Levite may</b> always <b>redeem from an Israelite</b> the house that he sold, <b>as this</b> Levite’s <b>power was enhanced,</b> in that he can redeem always, <b>and that</b> Israelite’s <b>power was diminished,</b> as he may redeem only within one year. <b>But a Levite may not</b> always redeem <b>from</b> another <b>Levite, as this</b> one’s <b>power was enhanced and that</b> one’s <b>power was</b> equally <b>enhanced.</b> Rather, the Levite may redeem only within one year of the sale. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man purchases <b>from the Levites,”</b> which literally means: And if a man redeems from the Levites, which teaches that even a Levite who redeems a house purchased by another Levite can always redeem the house. |
| Leviticus 25:33 | As it is taught | Arakhin 33a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to a Levite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that his consecrated property does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury without redemption? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if a man purchases from the Levites, the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out during the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:33). From the phrase <b>“that was sold…shall go out” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that any item sold by a Levite returns to him in the Jubilee Year, <b>even his slaves, movable property, and promissory notes.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “House…in the city of his possession,”</b> which teaches that these items do not return to the Levite without redemption. |
| Leviticus 25:33 | as the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession | Arakhin 33b:5 | The mishna provides the source for these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>As it is stated:</b> “And if a man purchases from the Levites, the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out during the Jubilee Year; <b>as the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession</b> among the children of Israel” (Leviticus 25:33). The verse indicates that the ability to always redeem the house of a Levite does not apply <b>unless</b> the one selling the house <b>will be a Levite and</b> the house is located in <b>the cities of the Levites.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: These matters are stated only</b> with regard to a house <b>in the cities of the Levites,</b> even if the owner was not a Levite. |
| Leviticus 25:33 | the cities of the Levites, as it is written: “As the houses of the cities of the Levites | Arakhin 33b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the house must be from <b>the cities of the Levites, as it is written: “As the houses of the cities of the Levites</b> are their possession” (Leviticus 25:33). <b>But from where do we</b> derive that the one selling the house must also be <b>a Levite</b> for these <i>halakhot</i> to apply? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And if a man purchases from the Levites</b>…shall go out during the Jubilee Year.” The verse is referring specifically to a Levite who sells his house. |
| Leviticus 25:33 | Rava: There it is different, as the verse states: “Then the house that was sold shall go out | Bava Metzia109a:8 | <b>Abaye interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> so that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> his disputant <b>Rava: There it is different, as the verse states: “Then the house that was sold shall go out</b>…in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:33), which teaches that the house or field that was <b>sold returns</b> to its owner, but the value of its <b>enhancement</b> does <b>not return,</b> but remains with the buyer. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us derive from it</b> a general <i>halakha</i> that the value of enhancement need not be returned. The Gemara answers: The two cases are dissimilar, as <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it is <b>a full-fledged sale, and the Jubilee</b> released it, as it <b>is a release of the King,</b> a Divine decree. Since the buyer had been in full ownership of the field, he keeps the value of the enhancement that occurred while it was his. By contrast, one who receives a field to cultivate is not an owner. |
| Leviticus 25:34 | as that is their perpetual possession” | Arakhin 28a:13 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to land, as it is stated</b> about the land of the Levites: “But the fields of the open land surrounding their cities may not be sold, <b>as that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34), and they cannot renounce that land. <b>And the statement of Rabbi Shimon appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to movable property,</b> which the Levites may dedicate, <b>as dedicated</b> property <b>is not theirs.</b> It is a gift for the priests, not the Levites. |
| Leviticus 25:34 | not dedicate land, as it is written: “As that is their perpetual possession” | Arakhin 28a:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> what is his reasoning? <b>Granted, priests may not dedicate</b> property, <b>as dedicated</b> property <b>is theirs;</b> it is one of the gifts of the priesthood. <b>But</b> why are <b>Levites</b> unable to dedicate their property? <b>Granted,</b> they may <b>not dedicate land, as it is written: “As that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34). <b>But let them dedicate movable property.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing, that a man may dedicate to the Lord <b>of all that he has,</b> whether of man or animal, <b>or of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the dedication of <b>movable property to</b> that of <b>land.</b> Accordingly, as Levites cannot dedicate land, they cannot dedicate movable property either. |
| Leviticus 25:34 | Rabbi Elazar said: As the verse states: “But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold” | Arakhin 33b:15 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: As the verse states: “But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:34). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“may not be sold”? If we say</b> it means that such fields <b>may not be sold at all,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32), one learns <b>by inference that</b> their fields <b>may be sold. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“may not be sold”?</b> It means that a field, an empty lot, or a city <b>may not be changed</b> from its current status. |
| Leviticus 25:34 | “For that is their perpetual possession” | Arakhin 34a:8 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> The verse <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written</b> with regard to the fields of Levites and priests: <b>“For that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34), from which it is derived that if a priest consecrated his ancestral field he may always redeem it, so too <b>this</b> dedicated field received by the priest <b>is also</b> considered <b>his ancestral</b> field, and if he consecrated it he may always redeem it. The juxtaposition of the dedicated field of a priest to the ancestral field of an Israelite <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>, as the verse states: <b>“His ancestral field</b> shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:31). The verse teaches that with regard to the <b>ancestral field</b> of a priest that he inherited from his father, <b>yes,</b> it remains in the possession of that priest in perpetuity, but with regard to <b>his dedicated</b> field, it does <b>not</b> remain in his possession in perpetuity; rather, it is divided among the members of the priestly watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year. |
| Leviticus 25:35 | borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother becomes poor | Arakhin 30b:8 | Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, continues: If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he</b> will be compelled to <b>borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother becomes poor</b> and his means fail with you, then you shall uphold him” (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and it is written</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“You shall take no interest or increase from him.”</b> |
| Leviticus 25:35 | since you are commanded to sustain a resident alien, | Avodah Zarah20a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> explain the wording of the verse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> word, “or,” teaches <b>that</b> one should <b>give precedence to giving to a resident alien over selling to a gentile. And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that <b>since you are commanded to sustain a resident alien,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall live with you” (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and you are not commanded to sustain a gentile, there is no need for a verse to</b> teach that one should <b>give precedence</b> to a resident alien. |
| Leviticus 25:35 | is written: “But if your brother be poor [ yamukh ]” | Bava Metzia114a:10 | § The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Avuh found Elijah standing in a graveyard of gentiles.</b> Rabba bar Avuh <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>making arrangements for the debtor?</b> Elijah <b>said to him:</b> A verbal analogy is <b>derived from</b> the usage of the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of a debtor and the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of <b>valuations.</b> With regard to <b>valuations,</b> it <b>is written: “But if he is too poor [<i>makh</i>] for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8), and <b>with regard to a creditor,</b> it <b>is written: “But if your brother be poor [<i>yamukh</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:35). |
| Leviticus 25:35 | “poor” | Bava Metzia114a:2 | § <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>making arrangements for the debtor</b> so that he will retain some of his possessions so that he may continue living as before, albeit at a slightly lower standard? The issue on which this is based is <b>whether or not</b> a verbal analogy is <b>derived from</b> the usage of the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of a debtor (Leviticus 25:35) and the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of <b>valuations</b> (Leviticus 27:8), as the Gemara will discuss further at the end of the <i>amud</i>. |
| Leviticus 25:35 | borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor and his means fails with you” | Kiddushin 20a:21 | The <i>baraita</i> continues its exposition of the verses in Leviticus: If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he</b> will eventually need to <b>borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor and his means fails with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“Take no</b> usury or interest <b>from him”</b> (Leviticus 25:36). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> eventually need to <b>sell himself, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor</b> with you <b>and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39). |
| Leviticus 25:35 | “with you” | Yevamot 47a:3 | As cited above, the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> states: “With you <b>in</b> your <b>land”</b> (Leviticus 19:33). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a convert is accepted <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael; <b>from where</b> do I derive that also <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael he is to be accepted? <b>The verse states: “With you,”</b> which indicates that <b>in any place that he is with you,</b> you should accept him. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>expound that</b> phrase in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> to teach that one doesn’t accept the claims of an individual that he is a valid convert? The Gemara explains: <b>One</b> of these <i>halakhot</i> is derived from the phrase <b>“with you”</b> in the verse cited, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> is derived from the phrase <b>“with you”</b> in a subsequent verse (Leviticus 25:35). |
| Leviticus 25:36 | it is different here, as the verse states: “Take no interest of him or increase, | Bava Kamma112a:3 | <b>Rava said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>the domain of an heir is not comparable to the domain of a purchaser. And</b> the reason they do not have to return the money is because <b>it is different here, as the verse states: “Take no interest of him or increase,</b> but fear your God, that your brother may live with you” (Leviticus 25:36), which teaches that you must <b>return</b> the interest <b>to him so that he may live with you.</b> Since the interest is returned for this reason and not because it is considered stolen goods, it is apparent that <b>the Merciful One is cautioning him,</b> the lender, to return it, but <b>the Merciful One is not cautioning his son</b> to return it. |
| Leviticus 25:36 | the verse states: “You shall not take from him neshekh or tarbit ; you shall fear your God | Bava Metzia61b:17 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “He has given forth with <i>neshekh</i> and he took <i>tarbit</i>, shall he live? He shall not live. He performed all these abominations,</b> he shall be executed; his blood shall be upon him” (Ezekiel 18:13). It can be inferred that one who takes interest is <b>subject to death</b> at the hand of Heaven <b>but not to repayment,</b> as the court cannot compel him to repay the interest. Citing a different proof, <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “You shall not take from him <i>neshekh</i> or <i>tarbit</i>; you shall fear your God</b> and your brother shall live with you.” (Leviticus 25:36). It can be inferred that one who does so is <b>subject to</b> shirking the <b>fear</b> of Heaven, <b>but not to repayment.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:36 | “And your brother shall live with you” | Bava Metzia62a:1 | <b>“And your brother shall live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36), from which it is derived: <b>Return</b> the interest <b>to him so that he may live.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:36 | and of: “Do not take from him | Bava Metzia75b:4 | <b>And these</b> people <b>violate a prohibition</b> of interest: <b>The lender, and the borrower, and the guarantor, and the witnesses. And the Rabbis say: Also the scribe</b> who writes the promissory note violates this prohibition. These parties to the transaction <b>violate</b> different prohibtions. Some are in violation of: <b>“You shall not give</b> him your money with interest” (Leviticus 25:37), <b>and of: “Do not take from him</b> interest or increase” (Leviticus 25:36), <b>and of: “Do not be to him as a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24), <b>and of “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24), <b>and of: “And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind, and you shall fear your God; I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). |
| Leviticus 25:36 | the verse states: “And your brother shall live with you” | Bava Metzia88b:16 | The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This cannot be the case, as <b>the verse states: “And your brother shall live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36), which indicates that the mitzva to provide sustenance applies only to <b>your brother, but not</b> to <b>an ox.</b> After refuting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the Gemara inquires: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that <b>an ox</b> must be allowed to eat <b>from attached</b> produce? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> the term <b>“your neighbor,” “your neighbor” twice</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26). <b>If</b> the second expression <b>is not</b> applied to the <b>matter of</b> the right of <b>a person</b> to eat <b>from attached</b> produce, as that <i>halakha</i> has been derived from the first mention of “your neighbor,” <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of an ox,</b> that it must be allowed to eat <b>from attached</b> produce. |
| Leviticus 25:36 | from him” | Kiddushin 20a:21 | The <i>baraita</i> continues its exposition of the verses in Leviticus: If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he</b> will eventually need to <b>borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor and his means fails with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“Take no</b> usury or interest <b>from him”</b> (Leviticus 25:36). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> eventually need to <b>sell himself, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor</b> with you <b>and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39). |
| Leviticus 25:36 | interest | Kiddushin 33b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this is referring to <b>fear of</b> God stated with regard to <b>interest</b> (Leviticus 25:36), <b>or</b> the <b>fear of</b> God stated with regard to <b>weights</b> (Deuteronomy 25:13–16), as the fear of God is mentioned with regard to these prohibitions as well. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> through a verbal analogy of <b>“<i>penei</i>” and “<i>penei</i>,”</b> as explained previously, not from a verbal analogy of the term “fear.” |
| Leviticus 25:36 | live with you” | Nedarim 65b:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And Rabbi Meir further said:</b> The halakhic authorities <b>may broach</b> dissolution <b>with him from that which is written in the Torah, and</b> they <b>may say to him: Had you known that</b> through your vow <b>you are transgressing</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not take vengeance”</b> (Leviticus 19:18) <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>“nor bear any grudge”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), and <b>“you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), as well as <b>“and your brother</b> should <b>live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36), <b>as he,</b> the one prohibited by the vow, <b>is poor and</b> now <b>you are not able to provide him</b> with a livelihood due to your vow, would you have vowed in that case? If <b>he said</b> in reply: <b>Had I known that it is so,</b> that my vow involved all these prohibitions, <b>I would not have vowed; it is dissolved.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:36 | that your brother may live with you” | Temurah 6b:5 | <b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Elazar? As the verse states:</b> “Take no interest of him or increase; but fear your God, <b>that your brother may live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36). The verse teaches that one must <b>return</b> the interest <b>to</b> the debtor <b>so that he will</b> be able to <b>live</b> together <b>with you.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:37 | food? | Bava Metzia60b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> in explaining the term <i>tarbit</i>, the <i>tanna</i> <b>sets aside the topic</b> of <b>interest by Torah law,</b> which is interest decided upon at the time of a loan, <b>and</b> instead <b>explicates</b> a case of lending with interest that is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one can conclude <b>by inference</b> that <b>by Torah law, <i>neshekh</i> and <i>tarbit</i> are one matter,</b> and there is no halakhic distinction between them. The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t</b> the <b>verses written</b> using the term <b><i>neshekh</i></b> for interest that is on a loan of <b>money and</b> <i>tarbit</i> or <i>marbit</i>, which are cognates of the term <b><i>ribit</i>,</b> for interest that is on a loan of <b>food?</b> This is as the verse states: “You shall not give him your money with <i>neshekh</i> and with <i>marbit</i> you shall not give him your food” (Leviticus 25:37). |
| Leviticus 25:37 | “You shall not give him your money with neshekh and with marbit you shall not give him your food” | Bava Metzia60b:19 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall not give him your money with <i>neshekh</i> and with <i>marbit</i> you shall not give him your food”</b> (Leviticus 25:37). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>neshekh</i> for</b> a loan of <b>money and</b> a prohibition of <b><i>ribit</i> for</b> a loan of <b>food. From where</b> is it derived that there is <b><i>neshekh</i> with regard to</b> a loan of <b>food</b> as well? The <i>baraita</i> answers: A different <b>verse states:</b> “You shall not lend with interest [<i>tashikh</i>] to your brother: <i>Neshekh</i> of money, <b><i>neshekh</i> of food,</b> <i>neshekh</i> of anything that is lent with interest [<i>asher yishakh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 23:20). The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that there is <b><i>ribit</i> with regard to</b> a loan of <b>money? The verse states: “<i>Neshekh</i> of money.”</b> |
| Leviticus 25:37 | “You shall not give | Bava Metzia75b:4 | <b>And these</b> people <b>violate a prohibition</b> of interest: <b>The lender, and the borrower, and the guarantor, and the witnesses. And the Rabbis say: Also the scribe</b> who writes the promissory note violates this prohibition. These parties to the transaction <b>violate</b> different prohibtions.

| Leviticus 25:38 | is considered as one who does not have a God. As it is stated: “To give to you the land of Canaan, to be your God” | Ketubot 110b:23 | § In relation to the basic point raised by the mishna concerning living in Eretz Yisrael, <b>the Sages taught: A person should always reside in Eretz Yisrael, even in a city that is mostly</b> populated by <b>gentiles, and he should not reside outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>even in a city that is mostly</b> populated by <b>Jews.</b> The reason is <b>that anyone who resides in Eretz Yisrael is considered as one who has a God, and anyone who resides outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is considered as one who does not have a God. As it is stated: “To give to you the land of Canaan, to be your God”</b> (Leviticus 25:38). |
| Leviticus 25:39 | to sell himself, as it is stated: “And when your brother becomes poor with you and sells himself to you” | Arakhin 30b:10 | If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he will</b> be compelled <b>to sell himself, as it is stated: “And when your brother becomes poor with you and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39). <b>Not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew; <b>rather,</b> he will even be sold <b>to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). <b>And not</b> only <b>to</b> a stranger who is <b>a convert, but</b> even <b>to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>], as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a <i>ger toshav</i></b> with you” (Leviticus 25:47). |
| Leviticus 25:39 | as it is written: “If your brother waxes poor with you and is sold unto you” | Bava Metzia71a:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>The convert that is mentioned concerning the sale</b> of a Hebrew slave is referring to the following, <b>as it is written: “If your brother waxes poor with you and is sold unto you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39), and it was expounded in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew, <b>but</b> he will be sold even <b>to a convert, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a stranger [<i>leger</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). |
| Leviticus 25:39 | and sells himself to you” | Kiddushin 20a:21 | The <i>baraita</i> continues its exposition of the verses in Leviticus: If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he</b> will eventually need to <b>borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor and his means fails with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“Take no</b> usury or interest <b>from him”</b> (Leviticus 25:36). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> eventually need to <b>sell himself, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor</b> with you <b>and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39). |
| Leviticus 25:40 | “hired worker.” | Kiddushin 14b:7 | The Gemara answers: One <b>derives</b> this through a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.”</b> This term appears both with regard to one who sells himself: “As a hired worker and as a settler he shall be with you” (Leviticus 25:40), and with regard to one who is sold by the court: “For double of the hire of a hired worker he has served you” (Deuteronomy 15:18). The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who</b> derives this verbal analogy between the terms <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.” But according to the one who does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” what can be said?</b> From where does he derive that one who sells himself may be purchased with money? |
| Leviticus 25:40 | is already stated: | Kiddushin 15a:14 | § According to the above explanation, both Rabbi Elazar and the first <i>tanna</i> accept the verbal analogy between “hired worker” and “hired worker.” <b>Rather, who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker”? It is this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> as follows with regard to the verse: “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year, then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, <b>and shall return to his own family</b> and to the possession of his fathers he shall return” (Leviticus 25:40–41). <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: What is the verse speaking of</b> when it states: “And shall return to his own family”? <b>If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who sold himself</b> and the Jubilee Year arrived during his six years of slavery, this <b>is already stated:</b> “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year, then he shall go out from you” (Leviticus 25:40). |
| Leviticus 25:40 | is already stated: | Kiddushin 15a:17 | <b>The Master said</b> earlier, in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> it is speaking <b>about a pierced</b> slave, it <b>is already stated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the verse that teaches that a pierced slave is released in the Jubilee Year? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And you shall return, each man to his land, and</b> you shall return, <b>each man to his family”</b> (Leviticus 25:10). <b>What is the verse speaking of? If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who sells himself,</b> it <b>is already stated:</b> “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:40). |
| Leviticus 25:40 | as it is written: “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year” | Kiddushin 16a:10 | § The mishna further states that a Hebrew slave is emancipated <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:40). |
| Leviticus 25:40 | a hired worker | Kiddushin 20a:12 | In a case where the slave was <b>sold to a Jew, from where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to him? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew: “As <b>a hired worker</b> and as a settler he shall be with you” (Leviticus 25:40), and it states with regard to one sold to a gentile: “As <b>a hired worker</b> year by year he shall be with him” (Leviticus 25:53), <b>for a verbal analogy.</b> This verbal analogy teaches that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to one sold to a gentile as to one sold to a Jew. |
| Leviticus 25:40 | “hired worker” | Kiddushin 21a:19 | <b>When you raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy comparing <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:40) and <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:53) from the case of a Jew sold to a gentile, and say that just as one can be redeemed by one’s relatives if sold to a gentile, so too, one can be redeemed if sold to a Jew? <b>And</b> at the same time <b>one does not interpret homiletically</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48), stated with regard to one sold to a gentile, as a restricting term. <b>Or perhaps</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> is in fact a restricting term, which indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>to this</b> slave, i.e., only one sold to a gentile can be redeemed by relatives, <b>and</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to another</b> slave, one sold to a Jew. |
| Leviticus 25:41 | and shall return to his own family” | Bava Metzia71a:12 | The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>. <b>A convert cannot be acquired as a Hebrew slave,</b> as <b>we require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: “Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, <b>and shall return to his own family”</b> (Leviticus 25:41), <b>and</b> a convert <b>is not</b> able to do this, since upon conversion the convert severs his relationship with his gentile family, and he therefore has no family. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And a woman or a convert may not acquire a Hebrew slave.</b> With regard to <b>a woman,</b> the reason is that it is <b>not proper conduct,</b> since people may say that she is purchasing him to engage in sexual intercourse with him. With regard to <b>a convert as well,</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition: Only one <b>who can be acquired</b> as a Hebrew slave <b>can acquire</b> a Hebrew slave, and one <b>who cannot be acquired</b> as a Hebrew slave <b>cannot acquire</b> a Hebrew slave. Since a convert cannot be acquired as a Hebrew slave, he also cannot acquire one. |
| Leviticus 25:41 | is already stated: | Kiddushin 15a:18 | <b>If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who was sold by the court,</b> it <b>is already stated:</b> “Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family” (Leviticus 25:41). It must be that <b>the verse is speaking of nothing other</b> than a slave <b>who is pierced two or three years before the Jubilee</b> Year, and <b>that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>releases him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that the verse is specifically referring to a pierced slave? <b>Rava bar Sheila said</b> that <b>the verse states “man.” What matter applies to a man and does not apply to a woman? You must say</b> that <b>this is piercing</b> a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl. |
| Leviticus 25:41 | “And he shall return to his own family” | Kiddushin 21b:12 | It was further stated in the above <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Yudan the Distinguished would teach: When they pierce</b> a slave <b>they pierce only the earlobe. And the Rabbis say: A Hebrew slave</b> who is <b>a priest is not pierced</b> at all, <b>because</b> piercing <b>renders him blemished.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> let him be pierced and <b>be rendered blemished</b> and disqualified for Temple service. Why is it prohibited to do this? <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila says: The verse states</b> concerning a Hebrew slave at the end of his servitude: <b>“And he shall return to his own family”</b> (Leviticus 25:41), i.e., <b>to his status in his family.</b> He must be able to return to the position he had as a member of his family. If he was rendered a blemished priest while a slave, once he is emancipated he can no longer return to his status as a priest who can perform the Temple service. |
| Leviticus 25:41 | “Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him” | Kiddushin 22a:11 | <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse that deals with the emancipation of a slave: <b>“Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him”</b> (Leviticus 25:41). <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> This verse is puzzling, as, <b>if he is sold, are his sons and daughters sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived that <b>his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his children,</b> and when the slave is emancipated his sons are released as well. <b>You say something similar</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If he is married then his wife shall go out with him”</b> (Exodus 21:3). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he is sold, is his wife sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his wife.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:41 | “And he returns to his family, and to the estate of his fathers he shall return” | Makkot 13a:4 | § The mishna teaches that there is a dispute as to whether the unintentional murderer <b>returns to the</b> same public <b>office that he occupied</b> prior to his exile. On a related note, <b>the Sages taught</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave liberated during the Jubilee Year, about whom it is written: <b>“And he returns to his family, and to the estate of his fathers he shall return”</b> (Leviticus 25:41): <b>He returns to his family, but he does not return to that</b> status of prominence and honor <b>that his ancestors held;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: He even returns to that</b> status of prominence and honor <b>that his ancestors held.</b> From the phrase <b>“to the estate of his fathers</b> he shall return,” it is derived that he returns to be <b>like his fathers.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:42 | “They shall not be sold as slaves” | Sanhedrin 86a:15 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is <b>a prohibition against abducting a person</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“They shall not be sold as slaves”</b> (Leviticus 25:42). The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree,</b> as each requires both verses to derive the prohibition. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>enumerates</b> the <b>prohibition against abduction, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>enumerates</b> the <b>prohibition against selling</b> the abductee into slavery. |
| Leviticus 25:45 | with regard to his labor? As it is stated: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, of them you may acquire” | Gittin 37b:19 | The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, he acquired</b> ownership <b>with regard to his labor, as Reish Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a gentile can acquire</b> another <b>gentile</b> as a slave <b>with regard to his labor? As it is stated: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, of them you may acquire”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This indicates that <b>you,</b> Jews, can <b>acquire</b> slaves <b>from them,</b> |
| Leviticus 25:45 | The verse states: “And also of the children of the residents who sojourn with you, of them you may buy” | Kiddushin 67b:5 | <b>The verse states: “And also of the children of the residents who sojourn with you, of them you may buy”</b> (Leviticus 25:45), which indicates that there is a way in which one may purchase slaves from the inhabitants of Canaan. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in intercourse with a maidservant from the</b> other <b>nations and fathered a son, that you are permitted to buy</b> the son <b>as a slave.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Which they have begotten in your land”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This means that one may purchase <b>from those</b> who are merely <b>begotten in your land,</b> whose fathers are not from the Canaanite nations, <b>but not from those who reside in your land,</b> i.e., whose fathers are from the seven Canaanite nations. |
| Leviticus 25:45 | as a slave? The verse states: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may you buy” | Sotah 3b:5 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one from</b> any of <b>the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman, and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave? The verse states: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may you buy”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This verse permits the purchase of slaves from among those individuals who are not members of the Canaanite nations, even if they settle in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Leviticus 25:45 | As it is written: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them you may acquire” | Yevamot 46a:6 | <b>As it is written: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them you may acquire”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). The verse states only that <b>you,</b> i.e., Jews, <b>can acquire</b> a slave <b>from them,</b> i.e., a gentile slave, <b>but they cannot acquire</b> a slave <b>from you,</b> i.e., a Jewish slave, <b>and they cannot acquire</b> a slave <b>from one another.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:45 | As it is stated: “And also from the children of the strangers that dwell among you, of them may you buy, | Yevamot 78b:2 | <b>When Ravina came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With respect to lineage, <b>among the</b> other <b>nations</b> of the world, i.e., while they are still gentiles, <b>follow the male,</b> but if they married after <b>they converted, follow the</b> more <b>flawed</b> in lineage <b>of the two.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Among the nations, follow the male, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if <b>one from the</b> other <b>nations had relations with a Canaanite</b> woman <b>and had a son</b> from her, <b>you are permitted to purchase him as a slave,</b> and he is not considered a Canaanite who may not be allowed to remain in Eretz Yisrael? <b>As it is stated: “And also from the children of the strangers that dwell among you, of them may you buy,</b> and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land; and they may be your possession” (Leviticus 25:45). |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you may make them an inheritance for your sons [ livneikhem ] after you” | Bava Batra110b:7 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> that a son precedes a daughter is derived <b>from here,</b> in the passage in the Torah addressing the inheritance of slaves, which states: <b>“And you may make them an inheritance for your sons [<i>livneikhem</i>] after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). One can infer: <b>“Your sons,” but not your daughters.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse states: <b>“That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons [<i>beneikhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21), should one infer that <b>this too</b> means: <b>“Your sons,” but not your daughters?</b> Is it not obvious that daughters are also worthy of receiving the blessing of longevity? |
| Leviticus 25:46 | The verse states: “Of them you may take your slaves forever; and over your brothers” | Bava Metzia73b:8 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Se’oram, the brother of Rava, would forcefully</b> seize <b>people who were not</b> acting <b>properly and</b> have them <b>carry Rava’s sedan chair. Rava said to him: You acted correctly, as we learn: If you see</b> a Jew <b>who does not behave properly, from where</b> is it derived <b>that you are permitted to have him work</b> as a slave? <b>The verse states: “Of them you may take your slaves forever; and over your brothers”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). It is derived from the conjunctive “and” linking the two clauses of the verse that there are circumstances where it is permitted to treat a fellow Jew as if he were a slave. One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> a Jew <b>acts properly.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> in the continuation: <b>“And over your brothers the children of Israel</b> you shall not rule, <b>one over another,</b> with rigor.” |
| Leviticus 25:46 | to hold for an ancestral possession” | Bekhorot 13a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>According to their laws? If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to the laws</b> relating <b>to</b> the purchase of a gentile’s <b>person</b> as a slave, i.e., the <i>halakhot</i> of purchasing gentiles themselves rather than the methods by which gentiles can acquire property, this must be based on the assumption that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the purchase of a gentile’s animal <b>is derived by</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> a gentile’s <b>person is acquired by a Jew</b> as a Canaanite slave <b>through</b> payment of <b>money, as it is written:</b> “And you may make them an inheritance for your children after you, <b>to hold for an ancestral possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to acquiring a gentile’s property. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | they will serve as bondsmen for you forever” | Berakhot 47b:17 | With regard to this incident, the Gemara asks: <b>How did he do that? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say: Anyone who frees his</b> Canaanite <b>slave violates a positive mitzva, as it is stated</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: “You will keep them as an inheritance for your children after you, to hold as a possession; <b>they will serve as bondsmen for you forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? How, then, could Rabbi Eliezer have freed his slave? The Gemara answers: The case of <b>a mitzva is different.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is a mitzva that comes through a transgression,</b> and a mitzva fulfilled in that manner is inherently flawed. The Gemara responds: <b>A mitzva</b> that benefits <b>the many is different,</b> and one may free his slave for that purpose. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | anyone who emancipates his slave violates a positive | Gittin 38a:17 | § The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain maidservant in Pumbedita with whom people were performing prohibited</b> sexual <b>acts,</b> and her master was unable to prevent this. <b>Abaye said: If not</b> for the fact <b>that Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says</b> that <b>anyone who emancipates his slave violates a positive</b> mitzva, as it is written in the Torah: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever” (Leviticus 25:46), <b>I would force her master, and he would write</b> and give <b>her a bill of manumission,</b> enabling her to marry a Jew, which would ensure that she would cease her promiscuous behavior. <b>Ravina said:</b> In a case <b>like that, Rav Yehuda concedes</b> that it is permitted to emancipate her, <b>due to the prohibited matter</b> that others are violating. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | Shmuel says: Anyone who emancipates his slave violates a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever” | Gittin 38b:3 | § The Gemara returns to discussing <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited above. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Anyone who emancipates his slave violates a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). This is a positive mitzva requiring that one subjugate slaves their entire lives. Therefore, it is prohibited to emancipate them. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession” | Gittin 39a:18 | The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b> if a slave is comparable to a wife, then <b>even</b> the slave of <b>a Jew</b> that dies should be freed entirely <b>as well,</b> just as his wife is. Why should this <i>halakha</i> apply only to the slave of a convert? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to slaves: <b>“And you may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). Therefore, slaves are not emancipated with the death of their owner, as the heirs have a right to the slaves. However, in the case of a convert who does not have heirs, the slaves are emancipated. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you may make them an inheritance for your sons after you” | Ketubot 43a:15 | This <i>halakha</i> <b>was also stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i>, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>a daughter who is sustained by the brothers, her earnings</b> nevertheless belong <b>to her. Rav Kahana said: What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to slaves: <b>“And you may make them an inheritance for your sons after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), from which it is inferred: It is <b>them,</b> slaves alone, that you bequeath <b>to your sons, and</b> you do <b>not</b> bequeath <b>your daughters to your sons.</b> This verse <b>teaches that a man does not bequeath a right</b> that he has over his <b>daughter to his son.</b> All the rights a man possesses over his daughter are personal rights, which are not transferable by inheritance. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | to her, as it is written: “And you may make them an inheritance for your sons after you” | Ketubot 43b:1 | We are dealing with a case <b>when he injured her in her face,</b> and therefore he must also pay for the loss of her value, a sum that belongs to her father. <b>Rav Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>a daughter who is sustained by the brothers, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her, as it is written: “And you may make them an inheritance for your sons after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), which indicates: It is <b>them,</b> slaves, that you bequeath <b>to your sons, and not your daughters to your sons.</b> This verse <b>teaches that a man does not bequeath a right</b> that he has over his <b>daughter to his son.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you shall bequeath them to your children after you” | Kiddushin 16a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the inference should be a different one: <b>But she can be acquired in</b> the manner of <b>the acquisition of</b> Canaanite <b>male slaves, and what is</b> this mode of acquisition? It is <b>possession.</b> The Gemara answers that one cannot interpret that verse in this manner, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), which indicates that you can acquire only <b>them,</b> i.e., Canaanite slaves, <b>through possession,</b> like an inherited tract of land, <b>but other</b> slaves <b>cannot</b> be acquired <b>through possession.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you shall bequeath them to your children after you” | Kiddushin 16b:14 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand the <i>baraita</i> that taught that the <b>severance gift of a Hebrew maidservant</b> is <b>for herself,</b> as this serves <b>to exclude</b> the maidservant’s <b>brothers.</b> These brothers do not receive the gifts after her father’s death, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). This verse indicates that <b>they,</b> Canaanite slaves, are bequeathed <b>to your sons, but your daughters</b> are <b>not</b> bequeathed <b>to your sons. From here</b> it is derived <b>that a person may not bequeath</b> his <b>rights to</b> profits generated by <b>his daughter to his son.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you shall bequeath them to your children as an ancestral inheritance” | Kiddushin 22b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that these are the modes by which a slave can be acquired? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children as an ancestral inheritance”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> Canaanite slaves <b>to an ancestral field: Just as an ancestral field can be acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a document, or by</b> means of the owner <b>taking possession</b> of it, <b>so too, a Canaanite slave can be acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a document, or by</b> means of the master <b>taking possession</b> of him. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | the verse states: “Of them you may take your slaves forever” | Kiddushin 22b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps one can interpret this juxtaposition differently: <b>Just as an ancestral field returns to its owners in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>so too a Canaanite slave returns to his</b> prior <b>owners in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of them you may take your slaves forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), which indicates that the sale is permanent. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession” | Megillah 23b:16 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to one who says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> and thereby pledges to donate a sum of money equivalent to his own monetary value to the Temple treasury, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> the court <b>assesses him as</b> though he were <b>a slave</b> in order to determine the amount he is obligated to donate to the Temple treasury. <b>And a slave is compared to land, as it is written</b> with regard to slaves: <b>“And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). Consequently, the same criteria that apply to assessing consecrated land apply to assessing the monetary value of an individual. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | the verse states: “And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you” | Nazir 61b:4 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> a different reason why a gentile cannot become a nazirite, despite the fact that the term “man” does include gentiles in the case of valuations. <b>Here,</b> with regard to naziriteship, it <b>is different, as</b> the verse prohibits a nazirite from becoming impure for his father and mother. This prohibition is not relevant for gentiles because <b>the verse states: “And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). This verse establishes a child as one to whom a person can bequeath his slaves, the subject of this verse. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “You may enslave them forever” | Niddah 47a:15 | The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel examined</b> these stages <b>in his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant, and</b> subsequently <b>gave her four dinars</b> as <b>payment for her humiliation.</b> The Gemara notes that in this regard <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said</b> that the verse: <b>“You may enslave them forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46) teaches: <b>I gave them</b> to you <b>for</b> the <b>service</b> of slaves, <b>but not for humiliation.</b> Consequently, if a master humiliated his Canaanite slave, he must pay him damages. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “Of them may you take your bondmen forever” | Sotah 3a:14 | The verse states: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), i.e., keeping one’s Canaanite slave forever, is <b>optional, this is the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> One is not enjoined against emancipating a Canaanite slave, but one is permitted to keep his Canaanite slaves forever. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> and it is prohibited for one to free his Canaanite slave. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “Of them may you take your bondmen forever” | Sotah 3b:3 | The Gemara discusses the third dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The verse states: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that one keeps his Canaanite slave forever, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> One is not enjoined against emancipating a Canaanite slave, but one is permitted to keep a Canaanite slave forever. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> and one is prohibited from freeing his Canaanite slave. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | it was necessary to write: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever” | Sotah 3b:4 | <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written</b> with regard to Canaanites: <b>“You shall save alive nothing that breathes”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16), <b>it was necessary to write: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), <b>as well,</b> in order <b>to permit one from any of the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman and she bore him a child.</b> This verse teaches <b>that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child as a slave, as he is not included in the mitzva “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” that was stated with regard to full-fledged Canaanites. Therefore, this verse cannot be teaching that it is mandatory. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “Of them may you take your bondmen forever” | Sotah 3b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the words in the same verse: <b>“Of them may you buy.”</b> Once the <i>halakha</i> is already taught that one may purchase as a slave the child of a Canaanite woman and a man from another nation, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? It is stated <b>to</b> teach that it is <b>mandatory</b> to enslave a Canaanite slave forever. |
| Leviticus 25:46 | “But over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor” | Sotah 3b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The prohibition against enslaving <b>your brethren is derived from the latter</b> phrase <b>of the verse,</b> where it is explicitly stated: <b>“But over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). |
| Leviticus 25:47 | to the stranger” | Arakhin 30b:10 | If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he will</b> be compelled <b>to sell himself, as it is stated: “And when your brother becomes poor with you and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39). <b>Not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew; <b>rather,</b> he will even be sold <b>to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). <b>And not</b> only <b>to</b> a stranger who is <b>a convert, but</b> even <b>to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>], as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a <i>ger toshav</i></b> with you” (Leviticus 25:47). |
| Leviticus 25:47 | the stranger” | Bava Kamma113b:3 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: How is it possible to differentiate between a gentile and a <i>ger toshav</i>? <b>Aren’t both of them written next to each other,</b> indicating that the same <i>halakha</i> pertains to both? As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One who violates the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year will be punished by having to resort to selling himself as a slave. And he will sell himself <b>not to you, but to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sell himself unto <b>the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 25:47), <b>and not to a stranger</b> who is a convert, <b>but to a <i>ger toshav</i>, as it is stated:</b> “And sell himself unto <b>the stranger who is a settler [<i>ger toshav</i>]</b> with you” (Leviticus 25:47). |
| Leviticus 25:47 | to a stranger who is a settler [ leger toshav ]” | Bava Metzia71a:10 | <b>And</b> this sale to a <i>ger</i> is referring to a sale <b>not</b> only <b>to a righteous convert [<i>leger tzedek</i>], but</b> even <b>to a <i>ger toshav</i>, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a stranger who is a settler [<i>leger toshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). With regard to the continuation of the verse: “Or to an offshoot of <b>a stranger’s family,” this is</b> referring to <b>a gentile,</b> i.e., he will reach a state where he has no choice but to sell himself to a gentile. <b>When it states: “Or to an offshoot</b> of a stranger’s family,” <b>this is</b> referring to <b>one sold for idol worship itself,</b> i.e., he is forced to sell himself as a slave to work in a temple of idol worship. |
| Leviticus 25:47 | to a stranger [ leger ]” | Bava Metzia71a:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>The convert that is mentioned concerning the sale</b> of a Hebrew slave is referring to the following, <b>as it is written: “If your brother waxes poor with you and is sold unto you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39), and it was expounded in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew, <b>but</b> he will be sold even <b>to a convert, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a stranger [<i>leger</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). |
| Leviticus 25:47 | acquire a Jew | Gittin 38a:2 | The Gemara now restates the question: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they shall not</b> be able to <b>acquire each other</b> as slaves even <b>for</b> the rights to <b>his labor.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You can say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>a gentile</b> can <b>acquire a Jew</b> for the rights to his labor, as stated explicitly in the Torah (Leviticus 25:47), <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that <b>a gentile</b> can acquire <b>a gentile?</b> |
| Leviticus 25:47 | becomes rich” | Kiddushin 14b:8 | The Gemara answers: The <b>verse states</b> at the start of the passage dealing with one sold to a gentile: <b>“And if</b> a stranger who is a settler with you <b>becomes rich”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). The conjunction “and” serves to <b>add to the first matter,</b> i.e., the passage discussing one who sells himself to a Jew, as it joins the two issues. And therefore <b>let the above case</b> of one who sells himself to a Jew <b>be derived from the case below</b> of one who is sold to a gentile: Just as one who is sold to a gentile can be acquired with money, so too, one who sells himself to a Jew can be acquired with money. |
| Leviticus 25:47 | to a stranger [ ger ]” | Kiddushin 20a:22 | The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>Not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew, <b>but</b> he will even be sold <b>to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a stranger [<i>ger</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). <b>And</b> this sale to a <i>ger</i> is <b>not</b> referring to a sale <b>to a righteous convert [<i>ger tzedek</i>], but</b> even <b>to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>], as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself to <b>a stranger who is a settler [<i>ger toshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). With regard to the continuation of the verse, “or to an offshoot of a stranger’s family,” the Gemara expounds: <b>“A stranger’s family”; this is a gentile,</b> i.e., he will reach a state where he has no choice but to sell himself to a gentile. <b>When it says: “To an offshoot</b> of a stranger’s family,” |
| Leviticus 25:47 | or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family” | Yevamot 46a:7 | When it is derived that: <b>But they cannot acquire</b> slaves <b>from you, to what</b> type of acquisition is it referring? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>for his labor, is that to say</b> that <b>a gentile cannot acquire a Jew for his labor? Isn’t it written:</b> “And if a stranger who is a settler with you becomes rich, and your brother becomes poor beside him, and he sells himself to the stranger who is a settler with you, <b>or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family”</b> (Leviticus 25:47), <b>and the Master said</b> in explanation of the phrase <b>“a stranger’s family”</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a gentile.</b> If so, the verse explicitly states that a Jew can sell himself as a slave to a gentile. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the reference is <b>to</b> selling <b>his body, and the Merciful One states</b> that <b>you,</b> i.e., Jews, <b>can acquire</b> a slave <b>from them,</b> which means <b>even his body.</b> Accordingly the verse indicates that a Jew can acquire a gentile slave’s body, but a gentile is unable to acquire ownership of another’s body, even that of another gentile. |
| Leviticus 25:48 | “After he is sold he may be redeemed” | Bava Kamma113a:23 | The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>But is robbery</b> from <b>a gentile permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva taught this matter when he came from Zephirin: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile?</b> It is from the fact that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Jew who has been sold as a slave to a gentile: <b>“After he is sold he may be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:48), |
| Leviticus 25:48 | the verse states: “After he is sold he shall be redeemed; one of his brothers may redeem him” | Kiddushin 20b:2 | Abaye <b>said to</b> that Sage: <b>There, the verse brings him back,</b> i.e., one must strive to redeem a Jew who has been sold as a slave. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since this</b> person who sold himself as a slave <b>has gone and become a priest for idol worship,</b> one might <b>say: Let us throw a stone after the fallen,</b> that is, since he has reached this nadir one should abandon him. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After he is sold he shall be redeemed; one of his brothers may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48). |
| Leviticus 25:48 | “may redeem him” | Kiddushin 21a:19 | <b>When you raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy comparing <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:40) and <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:53) from the case of a Jew sold to a gentile, and say that just as one can be redeemed by one’s relatives if sold to a gentile, so too, one can be redeemed if sold to a Jew? <b>And</b> at the same time <b>one does not interpret homiletically</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48), stated with regard to one sold to a gentile, as a restricting term. <b>Or perhaps</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> is in fact a restricting term, which indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>to this</b> slave, i.e., only one sold to a gentile can be redeemed by relatives, <b>and</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to another</b> slave, one sold to a Jew. |
| Leviticus 25:49 | may redeem him” | Kiddushin 15b:4 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This proof can be refuted, as one can say that <b>actually</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>does derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” and it is different here,</b> with regard to one sold to a gentile, <b>as the verse states:</b> “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son <b>may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). This emphasis of “him” teaches that redemption is an option only <b>for this</b> slave <b>and not for another</b> type of slave. |
| Leviticus 25:49 | this verse: | Kiddushin 15b:7 | <b>Rather,</b> as this suggested interpretation of the verse by Rabbi Akiva is clearly problematic, the Gemara retracts the previous explanation of the dispute and instead says that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the precise meaning of <b>this verse:</b> “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or any that is near of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he becomes rich, and he is redeemed” (Leviticus 25:49). <b>“Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him”; this is the redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives. “Or if he becomes rich”</b>; <b>this is redemption</b> by <b>himself. “And he is redeemed”; this is redemption by other</b> people. |
| Leviticus 25:49 | “he is redeemed” | Kiddushin 20b:9 | Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Didn’t you say there,</b> with regard to a thief who is sold to repay what he stole, that the verse: “And he is sold” (Exodus 22:2), teaches that <b>all of him is sold but not part of him?</b> If he is worth one thousand, and he owes five hundred for theft, he cannot be sold. <b>So too,</b> in the case of one who was sold to a gentile, the phrase <b>“he is redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:49) means <b>all of him and not part of him.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:49 | explicitly written with regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile: “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him” | Kiddushin 21a:21 | The Gemara asks: It is <b>explicitly written with regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile: “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). If so, it is unnecessary to derive the option of redemption by a relative from an inclusive expression in a different verse. |
| Leviticus 25:49 | “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son shall redeem him” | Yevamot 54b:22 | <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“his uncle”</b> and <b>“his uncle.” It is written here: “He has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:20), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to the redemption of a Jew who has been sold to a gentile: <b>“Either his uncle or his uncle’s son shall redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of redemption, it must be a relative <b>from the</b> side of his <b>father and not from the</b> side of his <b>mother, so too here,</b> with regard to forbidden relations, the prohibition applies to the wife of his father’s brother <b>from</b> his <b>father,</b> i.e., the wife of his father’s paternal brother, <b>and not from</b> his <b>mother.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:49 | of his family shall redeem him” | Yevamot 54b:23 | The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of redemption, <b>from where do we</b> derive that a maternal relative is not included? <b>The verse states:</b> “Or any that is near of kin to him <b>of his family shall redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49), and it is an established principle that only <b>the family of</b> one’s <b>father is called family,</b> while <b>the family of</b> one’s <b>mother is not called family,</b> as lineage is determined based upon one’s father. |
| Leviticus 25:50 | a verbal analogy, | Arakhin 30a:19 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a Hebrew slave who was sold to a gentile, that he is redeemed and</b> that <b>he has the advantage,</b> as the price of his redemption is always calculated according to the lesser value. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also applies in the case of a Hebrew slave who was <b>sold to a Jew? The verse states: “Hired worker,” “hired worker,”</b> in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy,</b> indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies both to a slave sold to a gentile and to one sold to a Jew. The verse states with regard to a slave sold to a gentile: “According to the time of a hired worker shall he be with him” (Leviticus 25:50), and with regard to a slave sold to a Jew, the verse states: “For double the hire of a hired worker he served you six years” (Deuteronomy 15:18). |
| Leviticus 25:50 | Therefore, the verse states: “And he shall reckon with him that bought him” | Bava Kamma113b:1 | indicating <b>that</b> one should <b>not take</b> a Hebrew slave by force <b>and</b> thereby allow him to <b>leave</b> the gentile’s jurisdiction. Rather, the Jew must be freed by legal means. <b>One might have thought</b> that it is permitted to <b>deceive him</b> in order to free the Jew. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “And he shall reckon with him that bought him”</b> (Leviticus 25:50), in order to teach that one must <b>be precise</b> in the financial dealings <b>with</b> the <b>purchaser</b> of a Hebrew slave, and one must pay him the appropriate sum without employing any form of deception. This indicates that it is prohibited to steal from a gentile. |
| Leviticus 25:50 | who is sold to idol worship, | Bava Kamma113b:4 | The verse continues and states: “Or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family.” When it says <b>“a stranger’s family,” this</b> is referring to <b>the gentile</b> family members of a <i>ger toshav</i>, who are idolaters. <b>When it says “or to the offshoot,” this</b> is referring to a Jew <b>who is sold to idol worship,</b> i.e., to work in a temple dedicated to idolatry. Since it is subsequently stated: “He shall reckon with him that bought him” (Leviticus 25:50), it is apparent that this reckoning applies equally to each of the above, including the gentile. This contradicts Rav Yosef’s answer. |
| Leviticus 25:50 | “And he shall reckon with his purchaser” | Kiddushin 17b:13 | § The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>a pierced</b> Hebrew slave <b>and one sold to a gentile serve neither the son nor the daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a pierced</b> slave is <b>as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which indicates that he serves this master, <b>but not the son or the daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to a Hebrew slave <b>sold to a gentile? Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the emancipating of a slave who was sold to a gentile: <b>“And he shall reckon with his purchaser”</b> (Leviticus 25:50), which teaches that this applies only to his purchaser <b>but not to the heirs of his purchaser.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:50 | Rava, | Kiddushin 18a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rava,</b> who derives the inheritance of gentiles from the verse: “And he shall reckon with his purchaser” (Leviticus 25:50)? The Gemara answers: <b>Is it written</b> explicitly in the Torah: <b>And he shall reckon with his purchaser and not with the heirs of his purchaser?</b> This proof is based on an exposition, not on an explicit source. |
| Leviticus 25:51 | from the money of his purchase” | Arakhin 30a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> in the case of a Hebrew slave, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the Torah is lenient with regard to his redemption? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case of a Hebrew slave who <b>was sold for one hundred</b> dinars, <b>and he appreciated</b> in value during his term of servitude <b>and</b> his value <b>stood at two hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if he redeems himself, the sum he pays for the remaining years of his service <b>is calculated only</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>one hundred</b> dinars for which he was originally sold? <b>As it is stated:</b> “If there are yet many years, according to them he shall return the price of his redemption <b>from the money of his purchase”</b> (Leviticus 25:51). |
| Leviticus 25:51 | It is written: “If there are yet many in the years, | Arakhin 30b:13 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Two verses are written with regard to redeeming someone who was sold to a gentile. <b>It is written: “If there are yet many in the years,</b> according to them he shall return the price of his redemption from the money that he was bought for” (Leviticus 25:51). <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: “And <b>if there remain but few in the years</b> until the Jubilee Year, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years he shall return the price of his redemption.” |
| Leviticus 25:51 | “From the money of his purchase” | Bekhorot 13a:22 | The Gemara discusses the statement of Rabbi Oshaya. <b>The Master said: And a gentile who gave money to a Jew to</b> buy the Jew’s <b>animal</b> from him <b>according to their laws, even though</b> the gentile <b>did not pull</b> the animal <b>he has acquired</b> it, <b>and</b> the Jew <b>is</b> therefore <b>exempt from</b> giving the animal’s <b>firstborn</b> offspring to a priest. <b>The Gemara clarifies: What is</b> the meaning of <b>according to their laws? If we say</b> that it means: <b>According to their laws of the person</b> of the Jew himself, i.e., the manner in which he purchases the person of a Jew with money, and it is reasonable to say so, <b>as it may be derived</b> through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> a gentile <b>acquires the body of a Jew with money, as it is written</b> in that regard: <b>“From the money of his purchase”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), then with regard to the <b>property</b> of a Jew, is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that the gentile can acquire it with money? |
| Leviticus 25:51 | verse states: “Out of the money that he was bought for” | Kiddushin 14b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>a Hebrew slave</b> can be <b>acquired through money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that the <b>verse states: “Out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), which <b>teaches</b> that he can be <b>acquired through money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> that <b>a Hebrew slave who is sold to a gentile</b> is acquired with money, which is the case discussed in that verse, but this proves nothing with regard to a Jew sold to a Jew. One could argue that <b>since all of the acquisitions</b> of a gentile are performed only <b>with money,</b> he can likewise purchase a Hebrew slave with money. |
| Leviticus 25:51 | money, as it is written: “Out of the money that he was bought for” | Kiddushin 16a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> he can be acquired through <b>money, as it is written: “Out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51). Likewise, it is <b>also</b> clear that he can be acquired with an item <b>worth money,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states: “He shall give back the price of his redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), which serves <b>to include</b> an item of <b>monetary value,</b> which is considered <b>like money.</b> In other words, any item of value can be used to redeem a slave. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this document</b> mentioned here, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say that</b> the slave <b>wrote</b> a promissory <b>note for his own money, that is</b> the same as <b>money.</b> What is the difference between the two cases? |
| Leviticus 25:51 | As it is stated: “Out of the money that he was bought for” | Kiddushin 20a:9 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to a slave who <b>was sold for one hundred dinars and increased</b> in value during his term, <b>and</b> his value <b>stood at two hundred</b> dinars, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if he wishes to redeem himself <b>one assesses him,</b> for the payment of the remainder of his service, based <b>only</b> on the calculation of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> his value when originally purchased? <b>As it is stated: “Out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51). |
| Leviticus 25:51 | “out of the money that he was bought for” | Kiddushin 20b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>But you said</b> that if the <b>money</b> of <b>his</b> value <b>increased,</b> one always pays <b>“out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), i.e., one calculates the value of the slave in accordance with his value at the time when he was acquired, even if that is less than his present value. Why, then, should one have to pay the full two hundred? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> he initially, before being sold, <b>increased in value,</b> was then sold for two hundred, <b>and</b> afterward <b>decreased</b> in value to one hundred, <b>and</b> subsequently he again <b>increased in value</b> so that he was worth the same amount as he was originally. In this case, his value of two hundred remains determinative. |
| Leviticus 25:51 | It is written: “If there be yet many of the years, | Kiddushin 20b:4 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Two verses are written</b> with regard to the redemption of a slave sold to a gentile. <b>It is written: “If there be yet many of the years,</b> according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for” (Leviticus 25:51), <b>and it is written: “And if there remain but few of the years</b> until the Jubilee Year, and he shall reckon with him, according to his years” (Leviticus 25:52). <b>But</b> how can <b>there be</b> both <b>many years and few years</b> when, in any case, he will not serve for more than six years? <b>Rather,</b> this means that as the <b>money</b> of <b>his</b> value <b>increased</b> with the passage of time, he is redeemed <b>“out of the money that he was bought for,”</b> i.e., the price for which he was originally sold, which is the lower sum. And if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>decreased</b> over time, one determines his value <b>“according to his years,”</b> i.e., according to his current value. |
| Leviticus 25:51 | out of the money that he was bought for” | Kiddushin 8a:2 | <b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> this opinion? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to redeeming a Hebrew slave: “He shall give back the price of his redemption <b>out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), which indicates: <b>He is acquired</b> specifically <b>through money and he is not acquired through grain or vessels.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:52 | As it is stated: “According to his years | Arakhin 30a:18 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Consider the case of a Hebrew slave who <b>was sold for two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and he depreciated</b> in value during his term <b>and</b> his value <b>stood at one hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if he redeems himself, the sum he pays for the remaining years of his service <b>is calculated only</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>one hundred</b> dinars he is currently worth? <b>As it is stated: “According to his years</b> he shall return the price of his redemption” (Leviticus 25:52). The verse indicates that the sum is calculated according to the value of his remaining years of service. |
| Leviticus 25:52 | one hundred dinars? The verse states: “According to his years | Kiddushin 20a:10 | If <b>he was sold for two hundred</b> dinars <b>and decreased</b> in value <b>and stood at one hundred dinars, from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when he is redeemed <b>one assesses him</b> based <b>only</b> on the calculation of <b>one hundred dinars? The verse states: “According to his years</b> he shall give back the price of his redemption” (Leviticus 25:52), meaning that he pays in accordance with the value of his remaining years of service. |
| Leviticus 25:52 | and it is written: “And if there remain but few of the years | Kiddushin 20b:4 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Two verses are written</b> with regard to the redemption of a slave sold to a gentile. <b>It is written: “If there be yet many of the years,</b> according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for” (Leviticus 25:51), <b>and it is written: “And if there remain but few of the years</b> until the Jubilee Year, and he shall reckon with him, according to his years” (Leviticus 25:52). <b>But</b> how can <b>there be</b> both <b>many years and few years</b> when, in any case, he will not serve for more than six years? <b>Rather,</b> this means that as the <b>money</b> of <b>his</b> value <b>increased</b> with the passage of time, he is redeemed <b>“out of the money that he was bought for,”</b> i.e., the price for which he was originally sold, which is the lower sum. And if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>decreased</b> over time, one determines his value <b>“according to his years,”</b> i.e., according to his current value. |
| Leviticus 25:52 | his redemption [ ge’ullato ]” | Kiddushin 20b:8 | The Gemara analyzes the sides of the dilemma: With regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile, the verse states: “According to his years he shall give back the price of <b>his redemption [<i>ge’ullato</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:52), and the meaning of the term “<i>ge’ullato</i>” can be <b>derived from</b> the same term stated with regard to the redemption of an ancestral field: “And he becomes rich and finds sufficient means to <b>redeem it [<i>ge’ullato</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:26). Accordingly, <b>just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed,</b> but is either fully redeemed or not at all, <b>so too, this</b> slave <b>cannot be partially redeemed. Or perhaps we say</b> that he cannot be partially redeemed only if that leads <b>to a leniency,</b> but <b>we do not say</b> that he cannot be redeemed if it leads <b>to a stringency.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:53 | “Like a hired laborer, year by year” | Bava Metzia65a:9 | By contrast, in <b>the latter clause, since it is a sale, and</b> the owner of the field <b>wants</b> to <b>take</b> the <b>money from now,</b> if he agrees to a later payment at a higher price, this is <b>therefore</b> considered <b>payment for waiting, and</b> it is <b>forbidden. Rava said: The Sages examined this matter closely and established</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from the verse</b> that states: <b>“Like a hired laborer, year by year”</b> (Leviticus 25:53). It is derived from this verse that the obligation <b>to pay the rental</b> fee <b>of this year is</b> incurred <b>only in the following year.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:53 | “hired worker.” | Kiddushin 15b:3 | The Gemara explains the proof: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” why</b> does he <b>say: If one who cannot be redeemed by these,</b> with regard to one who is sold to a Jew? <b>Let him derive</b> that <i>halakha</i> from the case of one sold to a gentile, through the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.”</b> The term “hired worker” is used in reference to one sold to a gentile as well: “As a hired worker year by year he shall be with him” (Leviticus 25:53), and accordingly one can say that even one sold to a Jew can be redeemed by his relatives. The fact that he does not accept this claim indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rejects the verbal analogy between “hired worker” and “hired worker.” |
| Leviticus 25:53 | a hired worker | Kiddushin 20a:12 | In a case where the slave was <b>sold to a Jew, from where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to him? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew: “As <b>a hired worker</b> and as a settler he shall be with you” (Leviticus 25:40), and it states with regard to one sold to a gentile: “As <b>a hired worker</b> year by year he shall be with him” (Leviticus 25:53), <b>for a verbal analogy.</b> This verbal analogy teaches that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to one sold to a gentile as to one sold to a Jew. |
| Leviticus 25:53 | “hired worker” | Kiddushin 21a:19 | <b>When you raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy comparing <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:40) and <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:53) from the case of a Jew sold to a gentile, and say that just as one can be redeemed by one’s relatives if sold to a gentile, so too, one can be redeemed if sold to a Jew? <b>And</b> at the same time <b>one does not interpret homiletically</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48), stated with regard to one sold to a gentile, as a restricting term. <b>Or perhaps</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> is in fact a restricting term, which indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>to this</b> slave, i.e., only one sold to a gentile can be redeemed by relatives, <b>and</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to another</b> slave, one sold to a Jew. |
| Leviticus 25:54 | “And if he is not redeemed by any of these, | Kiddushin 15b:1 | A Hebrew slave sold to a gentile can be redeemed by his relatives, as it is stated: <b>“And if he is not redeemed by any of these,</b> then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:54). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He can be redeemed</b> only <b>through these,</b> i.e., the assistance of his relatives, <b>and he is not redeemed after six</b> years of labor. |
| Leviticus 25:54 | then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year” | Kiddushin 15b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse: “And if he is not redeemed by any of these means, <b>then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:54)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year.”</b> If the slave is not redeemed prior to this point in time he leaves his gentile master only in the Jubilee Year. |
| Leviticus 25:54 | he is not redeemed by any of these” | Kiddushin 15b:5 | With regard to the dispute itself the Gemara inquires: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>disagrees with Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to this? It is <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if <b>he is not redeemed by any of these”</b> (Leviticus 25:54), that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> The expression <b>“by any of these”</b> indicates that redemption by one’s relatives is <b>to freedom,</b> i.e., one becomes an entirely free man. But if a slave is redeemed <b>by anyone else</b> who pays the gentile master, it is <b>to slavery.</b> The redeemed slave becomes indentured to his redeemer until he repays the cost of his redemption through his work. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> the opposite: <b>By these</b> relatives he is redeemed <b>to slavery,</b> whereas if he is redeemed <b>by anyone else,</b> it is <b>to freedom.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:55 | are called slaves, as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are slaves to Me” | Bava Batra10a:3 | Turnus Rufus <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>On the contrary, it is this</b> charity <b>which condemns you,</b> the Jewish people, <b>to Gehenna</b> because you give it. <b>I will illustrate</b> this <b>to you with a parable. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his slave and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this, would he not be angry with</b> that person? <b>And you,</b> after all, <b>are called slaves, as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are slaves to Me”</b> (Leviticus 25:55). If God decreed that a certain person should be impoverished, one who gives him charity defies the will of God. |
| Leviticus 25:55 | as it is written: “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants” | Bava Kamma116b:14 | The Gemara explains: <b>As long as he did not retract</b> his commitment, he is <b>considered</b> to be under the <b>jurisdiction of the employer,</b> so that anything he saves automatically belongs to the employer. <b>And when he retracts</b> his commitment, <b>it is</b> for <b>a different reason</b> that he is able to do so, <b>as it is written: “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants”</b> (Leviticus 25:55), indicating that Jews are servants of God, <b>but not servants of servants,</b> i.e., of other Jews. Consequently, it is permitted for a laborer to conclude his term of employment whenever he wants. Once he does so, if he saves property that the members of the caravan are unable to rescue, the property belongs to him. |
| Leviticus 25:55 | a different reason, as it is written: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves; | Bava Metzia10a:11 | Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: As long as he does not retract</b> his commitment, his hand <b>is like the employer’s hand. When</b> he does <b>retract</b> his commitment, he <b>is</b> able to do so. But this is not because matters are structured to the benefit of the laborer, but for <b>a different reason, as it is written: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves;</b> they are My slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 25:55), which indicates: <b>They are My slaves, and not slaves of slaves,</b> i.e., of other Jews. Consequently, a Jew can never be enslaved to another Jew with a contract from which he cannot release himself whenever he wishes. Nevertheless, as long as the laborer does not quit the job, he is considered his employer’s agent. |
| Leviticus 25:55 | ear heard My voice on Mount Sinai when I said: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves” | Kiddushin 22b:4 | <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai would expound this verse as a type of decorative wreath [<i>ḥomer</i>],</b> i.e., as an allegory: <b>Why is the ear different from all the other limbs in the body,</b> as the ear alone is pierced? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> This <b>ear heard My voice on Mount Sinai when I said: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves”</b> (Leviticus 25:55), which indicates: <b>And</b> they should <b>not</b> be <b>slaves to slaves. And</b> yet <b>this</b> man <b>went and</b> willingly <b>acquired a master for himself.</b> Therefore, <b>let</b> this ear <b>be pierced.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:1 | “Nor shall you install any figured stone in your land, to bow down upon it” | Megillah 22b:11 | The Gemara answers: <b>It was a stone floor, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Nor shall you install any figured stone in your land, to bow down upon it”</b> (Leviticus 26:1), that, <b>upon it,</b> i.e., any type of figured stone, <b>you shall not bow down in your land,</b> i.e., anywhere in your land other than in the Temple; <b>but you shall bow down upon the stones of the Temple.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla,</b> as <b>Ulla said: The Torah prohibited</b> bowing down <b>only</b> upon <b>a stone floor.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:2 | And it is written: “And you shall observe My Shabbatot | Shabbat 69b:8 | We learned in the mishna that there is a difference in <i>halakha</i> between <b>one who knows the essence of Shabbat</b> and one who does not know it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the Torah <b>are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Two verses are written.</b> One states: <b>“And the children of Israel observed the Shabbat,</b> to perform the Shabbat through their generations, an everlasting covenant” (Exodus 31:16). <b>And it is written: “And you shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i></b> and you shall revere My Sanctuary, I am God” (Leviticus 26:2). <b>How</b> is it that Shabbat is in the singular in one verse, while in the other it is in the plural [<i>Shabbatot</i>]? It should be understood as follows: <b>“And the children of Israel observed the Shabbat”: One observance for multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>.</b> If one commits several transgressions, in certain cases he is only liable to bring one sacrifice. <b>“And you shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>”: One observance for each and every Shabbat.</b> In certain cases, one is liable to bring a sin-offering for each time that he unwittingly desecrated Shabbat. |
| Leviticus 26:3 | “If you walk in My statutes” | Avodah Zarah5a:20 | <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If you walk in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3): In this context, <b>“if”</b> is <b>a term</b> that means <b>nothing other than supplication,</b> i.e., God is hoping that the Jewish people will observe the Torah. <b>And similarly, it is stated: “Oh that My people would hearken to Me,</b> that Israel would walk in My ways, <b>I would soon subdue their enemies”</b> (Psalms 81:14–15). <b>And it states: “Oh that you would hearken to My commandments! Then your peace would be as a river,</b> and your righteousness as the waves of the sea. <b>Your seed also would be as the sand, and the offspring of your body</b> like its grains” (Isaiah 48:18–19). |
| Leviticus 26:3 | in My statutes” | Bava Batra88b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Levi says: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed the Jewish people with twenty-two, and cursed them with</b> only <b>eight.</b> Rabbi Levi explains: <b>He blessed them with</b> the <b>twenty-two</b> letters of the Hebrew alphabet, <b>from</b> the first letter, <i>alef</i>, that begins the verse: <b>“If [<i>im</i>] you</b> walk <b>in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3), <b>until “upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13), which ends with the letter <i>tav</i>, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. |
| Leviticus 26:3 | that it is written: “If you walk in My statutes” | Kiddushin 61b:13 | The Gemara asks a related question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “If you walk in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3), you will receive blessings; conversely: <b>“And if you shall reject My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:15), you will receive curses. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need both of these clauses? The Gemara answers: They are both <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: If you follow My statutes</b> you will receive <b>a blessing,</b> whereas <b>if you reject My statutes</b> you will receive <b>neither a blessing nor a curse.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the rejection of God’s statutes warrants a curse. |
| Leviticus 26:4 | The Sages taught: “Then I will give your rains in their season” | Taanit 22b:19 | <b>The Sages taught: “Then I will give your rains in their season”</b> (Leviticus 26:4). This means that the earth will be <b>neither drunk nor thirsty; rather, a moderate</b> amount of rain will fall. <b>For as long as the rains are abundant, they muddy</b> the soil of <b>the land, and it does not give out</b> its <b>produce. Alternatively,</b> |
| Leviticus 26:6 | “Neither shall a sword go through your land” | Taanit 22b:4 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason <b>was Josiah punished? Because he should have consulted with</b> the prophet <b>Jeremiah</b> to find out if he should go to war, <b>but he did not consult</b> with him. <b>How did</b> Josiah <b>interpret</b> the verses of the Torah? How did they lead him to go to war? The verse states: <b>“Neither shall a sword go through your land”</b> (Leviticus 26:6). |
| Leviticus 26:10 | “And you shall eat old store long kept” | Bava Batra91b:16 | <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse in the chapter of the blessings stated to the Jewish people: <b>“And you shall eat old store long kept”</b> (Leviticus 26:10). This <b>teaches that any</b> produce <b>that is older than other</b> produce of that same type will be <b>better than</b> that <b>other</b> produce. <b>And I have</b> derived that this is the case <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items</b> for <b>which</b> it is the normal <b>manner to age them. From where</b> do I derive in the case of <b>items</b> for <b>which</b> it is <b>not</b> the normal <b>manner to age them,</b> e.g., fruit, that they too will improve with age? <b>The verse states: “Old store long kept,”</b> a general expression that indicates that <b>in any case</b> the land will keep its produce from spoiling, as all types of produce will improve with age. |
| Leviticus 26:11 | Granted, the Temple is called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you” | Eruvin 2a:14 | The Gemara questions its previous conclusion: <b>Granted, the Temple is called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you”</b> (Leviticus 26:11), and the reference is to the permanent Sanctuary, i.e., the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people settle in their land. <b>However,</b> the fact that <b>the Tabernacle is called Temple, from where do we</b> derive it? The Gemara answers: <b>If you say</b> that it is derived <b>from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, the bearers of the Temple, set forward, that they may set up the Tabernacle before they came”</b> (Numbers 10:21), |
| Leviticus 26:11 | called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you” | Shevuot 16b:4 | The Gemara questions its previous assumption: <b>Granted, the Temple is</b> also <b>called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you”</b> (Leviticus 26:11), where the reference is to the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people have settled in their land. <b>But from where do we</b> derive <b>that the Tabernacle is</b> also <b>called Temple? If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, the bearers of the Temple, set forward”</b> (Numbers 10:21), <b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the Ark</b> and the other sacred vessels. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple, that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle, as immediately afterward <b>it is written: “According to all that I show you, the pattern of the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 25:9). |
| Leviticus 26:13 | “And I will make you go upright [ komemiyyut ]” | Bava Batra75a:12 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, based on a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And I will make you go upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13). <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the future, the Jewish people will have the stature of <b>two hundred cubits, equivalent to two</b> times the <b>height [<i>komot</i>] of Adam the first</b> man, whose height was one hundred cubits. Rabbi Meir interprets the word <i>komemiyyut</i> as two <i>komot</i>. |
| Leviticus 26:13 | until “upright [ komemiyyut ]” | Bava Batra88b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Levi says: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed the Jewish people with twenty-two, and cursed them with</b> only <b>eight.</b> Rabbi Levi explains: <b>He blessed them with</b> the <b>twenty-two</b> letters of the Hebrew alphabet, <b>from</b> the first letter, <i>alef</i>, that begins the verse: <b>“If [<i>im</i>] you</b> walk <b>in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3), <b>until “upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13), which ends with the letter <i>tav</i>, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. |
| Leviticus 26:13 | “And I made you go upright [ komemiyyut ]” | Sanhedrin 100a:9 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan that the gates will be twenty cubits high. The Sages engaged in a dispute concerning the interpretation of the verse: <b>“And I made you go upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13). <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that in the end of days people will be <b>two hundred cubits</b> tall, <b>the equivalent of twice the height of Adam the first</b> man, who was one hundred cubits tall. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> People will be <b>one hundred cubits</b> tall, <b>corresponding to</b> the height of the <b>Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “For our sons are as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as cornerstones, carved in the fashion of a palace”</b> (Psalms 144:12), indicating that the sons and daughters will be one hundred cubits tall, the height of the Sanctuary. If the people are that tall, how will they enter gates twenty cubits high? |
| Leviticus 26:14 | “But if you will not hearken to me” | Megillah 31b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>On</b> the <b>Ninth of Av itself, what do we read as the <i>haftara</i>? Rav said:</b> The portion containing the verse <b>“How</b> did the faithful city <b>become a harlot?”</b> (Isaiah 1:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What Torah portion</b> do they read? <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>others say:</b> They read the portion containing the verse <b>“But if you will not hearken to me”</b> (Leviticus 26:14). <b>Rabbi Natan bar Yosef said:</b> They read the portion containing the verse: <b>“How long will this people provoke me?”</b> (Numbers 14:11). <b>And some say:</b> They read the portion containing the verse: <b>“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?”</b> (Numbers 14:27). The Gemara comments that <b>Abaye said: Nowadays, everyone is accustomed to read</b> the portion of <b>“When you shall beget children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:25–40), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“I will utterly consume them”</b> (Jeremiah 8:13–9:23). |
| Leviticus 26:15 | “And if [ ve’im ] you shall reject My statutes” | Bava Batra88b:11 | <b>And He cursed them with eight</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And if [<i>ve’im</i>] you shall reject My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:15), <b>until: “And My statutes were abhorred by their soul [<i>nafsham</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:43), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. There are eight letters in the Hebrew alphabet from the letter <i>vav</i> to the letter <i>mem</i>, inclusive. |
| Leviticus 26:15 | “And if you shall reject My statutes” | Kiddushin 61b:13 | The Gemara asks a related question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “If you walk in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3), you will receive blessings; conversely: <b>“And if you shall reject My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:15), you will receive curses. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need both of these clauses?

| Leviticus 26:16 | as it is stated: “I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror [ behala ] over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail and the soul to languish; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it” | Shabbat 32b:7 | Together with these statements, the Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for additional rabbinic adages with regard to punishments for various sins: <b>Hate, <i>ḥalla</i>, <i>teruma</i>, stolen, judgment, oath, pouring, uncovering, and vulgarity. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: Due to the sin of gratuitous hatred</b> that one has for another, the punishment is <b>great discord within a person’s home, and his wife miscarries, and his sons and daughters die when they are young. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said: Due to the sin</b> of failure to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from the dough, <b>no blessing takes effect on the</b> grain <b>gathered</b> in the storehouse <b>and a curse spreads to the prices</b> of crops, which increase, <b>and they plant seeds and others eat</b> their yield, <b>as it is stated: “I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror [<i>behala</i>] over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail and the soul to languish; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 26:16). <b>Do not read</b> it <b><i>behala</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>beḥalla</i>.</b> Due to negligence in the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> from the dough, these punishments come. <b>And if they give</b> <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>they are blessed, as it is stated: “And the first of your dough you shall give unto the priest to cause a blessing to rest on your house”</b> (Ezekiel 44:30). |
| Leviticus 26:19 | wealthy, as it is written: “And I will break the pride of your power” | Gittin 37a:1 | <b><i>Bulei</i>, these are</b> the <b>wealthy, as it is written: “And I will break the pride of your power”</b> (Leviticus 26:19), <b>and Rav Yosef taught</b> with regard to this verse: <b>These are the <i>bula’ot</i>,</b> the wealthy people, <b>of Judea. <i>Butei</i>, these are the poor,</b> who are in need of a loan, <b>as it is written:</b> “You shall not shut your hand from your needy brother; but you shall open your hand to him, and <b>you shall lend him [<i>ha’avet ta’avitenu</i>]</b> sufficient for his need” (Deuteronomy 15:7–8). Therefore, the <i>prosbol</i> was instituted both for the sake of the wealthy, so that the loans they would give to the poor person would not be canceled, and for the sake of the poor, so that they would continue to find those willing to lend them money. <b>Rava said to a foreigner</b> who spoke Greek: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>prosbol</i>? He said to him:</b> It means the <b>institution [<i>pursa</i>] of a matter.</b> |

| Leviticus 26:25 | When it says: “And I will bring upon you the sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant” | Sanhedrin 52b:13 | The Gemara answers that it is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the verse: “And if a man smites his slave or his maidservant by the staff and he dies under his hand, <b>he shall be avenged”</b> (Exodus 21:20). Prima facie, <b>I do not know what this vengeance is</b> referring to. <b>When it says: “And I will bring upon you the sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant”</b> (Leviticus 26:25), <b>you must say</b> that <b>vengeance is</b> decapitation by the <b>sword.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:25 | by weight. As it is written: “And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; | Shabbat 33a:2 | Furthermore, the Sages said that <b>due to the sin of delay of justice,</b> i.e., judges delay issuing their rulings due to personal considerations, <b>and</b> for <b>distortion of justice,</b> i.e., judges intentionally distort their verdicts, <b>and</b> for <b>miscarriage of justice</b> that results from negligence, <b>and</b> for <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, violence and looting abound</b> in the world, <b>and pestilence and famine come, and people eat and are not sated, and they eat their bread</b> measured <b>by weight.

The study of Torah is the mitzva practiced both day and night. <b>And it is written</b> with regard to this punishment: <b>“When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake</b> your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied” (Leviticus 26:26). <b>And it is written: “Even because they rejected My ordinances,</b> and their soul abhorred My statutes” (Leviticus 26:43). All of these punishments result from breaching the covenant of the Torah and the perversion of justice. |
| Leviticus 26:26 | a curse: | Menachot 87b:15 | Rami bar Ḥama responds: <b>And let him bring</b> scales into the courtyard. Rav Ḥisda explains: <b>Since in</b> God’s admonition of the Jewish people the act of weighing bread is <b>written</b> as part of <b>a curse:</b> “When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and you shall eat and not be satisfied” (Leviticus 26:26), as weighing bread is generally performed only at a time of famine, therefore it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to weigh the dough in the Temple. |
| Leviticus 26:26 | Rava said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And ten women shall bake your bread in one oven” | Pesachim 37b:8 | <b>Rava said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And ten women shall bake your bread in one oven”</b> (Leviticus 26:26). Rava learns from this verse that <b>bread baked in one oven is called bread, and that</b> which <b>is not baked in one oven,</b> but rather in several different vessels, <b>is not called bread.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:26 | “When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake | Shabbat 33a:2 | Furthermore, the Sages said that <b>due to the sin of delay of justice,</b> i.e., judges delay issuing their rulings due to personal considerations, <b>and</b> for <b>distortion of justice,</b> i.e., judges intentionally distort their verdicts, <b>and</b> for <b>miscarriage of justice</b> that results from negligence, <b>and</b> for <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, violence and looting abound</b> in the world, <b>and pestilence and famine come, and people eat and are not sated, and they eat their bread</b> measured <b>by weight.

| Leviticus 26:30 | “And I shall cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols” | Sanhedrin 63b:22 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the Jewish people engaged in idol worship for its own sake and not for the sake of engaging in forbidden sexual relations: In interpretation of the verse: <b>“And I shall cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols”</b> (Leviticus 26:30), the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>Elijah the Righteous,</b> the prophet, <b>would search for those who were swollen with hunger in Jerusalem. He once found a child who was swollen</b> with hunger <b>and lying in the garbage.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:30 | is stated: “And I shall cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols” | Sanhedrin 64a:2 | <b>Immediately,</b> the child <b>removed his god from his bosom and</b> began <b>hugging it and kissing it, until his stomach burst</b> from hunger, <b>and his god fell to the earth and he fell upon it, in fulfillment of that</b> which <b>is stated: “And I shall cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols”</b> (Leviticus 26:30). This incident demonstrates that the Jewish people engaged in idol worship for its own sake. The Gemara answers: This also occurred <b>after</b> the Jewish people <b>became attached to</b> idol worship. |
| Leviticus 26:30 | And with regard to idol worship it is written: “And I will cast your carcasses | Shabbat 33a:6 | <b>And with regard to idol worship it is written: “And I will cast your carcasses</b> upon the carcasses of your idols” (Leviticus 26:30). <b>And it is written: “And I will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation,</b> and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors” (Leviticus 26:31). <b>“And you will I scatter among the nations,</b> and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste” (Leviticus 26:33). |
| Leviticus 26:31 | as it is stated: “And I will bring desolation to your sanctuaries” | Megillah 28a:23 | The <i>halakha</i> that a synagogue in disrepair still may not be used for mundane purposes is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And I will bring desolation to your sanctuaries”</b> (Leviticus 26:31). The fact that the word “sanctuaries” appears after the word “desolation” indicates that <b>their sanctity</b> remains upon them <b>even when they are desolate.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:31 | And it is written: “And I will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, | Shabbat 33a:6 | <b>And with regard to idol worship it is written: “And I will cast your carcasses</b> upon the carcasses of your idols” (Leviticus 26:30). <b>And it is written: “And I will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation,</b> and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors” (Leviticus 26:31). <b>“And you will I scatter among the nations,</b> and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste” (Leviticus 26:33). |
| Leviticus 26:33 | “And you will I scatter among the nations, | Shabbat 33a:6 | <b>And with regard to idol worship it is written: “And I will cast your carcasses</b> upon the carcasses of your idols” (Leviticus 26:30). <b>And it is written: “And I will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation,</b> and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors” (Leviticus 26:31). <b>“And you will I scatter among the nations,</b> and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste” (Leviticus 26:33). |
| Leviticus 26:34 | the Sabbatical and Jubilee Years it is written: “Then shall the land be paid her Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemies’ land; | Shabbat 33a:7 | <b>With regard to</b> the sin of failure to observe <b>the Sabbatical and Jubilee Years it is written: “Then shall the land be paid her Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemies’ land;</b> even then shall the land rest, and repay her Sabbaths” (Leviticus 26:34). <b>And it is written: “As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest;</b> even the rest which it had not in your Sabbaths, when you dwelt upon it” <b>(</b>Leviticus 26: 35). |
| Leviticus 26:36 | which is written: “A driven leaf [ niddaf ]” | Niddah 4b:4 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: That principle, that in any case of uncertainty involving impurity in a private domain the item with uncertain status is deemed impure, applies to a case of impurity by Torah law, whereas <b>here</b> we are dealing <b>with ritual impurity by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara adds: The language of the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> There was a loaf resting on top of a shelf, and there was an item of light impurity [<i>madaf</i> ] lying underneath it. The term <b><i>madaf</i></b> is similar to that <b>which is written: “A driven leaf [<i>niddaf</i> ]”</b> (Leviticus 26:36), i.e., a light item. Likewise, the <i>Tosefta</i> is referring to a light, or rabbinic, impurity. |
| Leviticus 26:37 | But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another” | Sanhedrin 27b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are descendants <b>not</b> punished for the sins of their ancestors unless they adopt their behavior? <b>But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another”</b> (Leviticus 26:37)? This verse is homiletically interpreted to mean that the Jewish people shall stumble, <b>one due to the iniquity of another,</b> i.e., they are punished for each other’s sins, which <b>teaches that all</b> Jews are considered <b>guarantors,</b> i.e., responsible, <b>for one another.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:37 | from the entire world? But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another” | Shevuot 39a:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah,</b> is punishment <b>not</b> exacted <b>from the entire world? But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another”</b> (Leviticus 26:37)? This verse is homiletically interpreted to mean that they shall stumble spiritually, <b>one due to the iniquity of another,</b> which <b>teaches that the entire Jewish people are</b> considered <b>guarantors for one another.</b> Apparently, any transgression makes the entire world liable to be punished. |
| Leviticus 26:38 | Moses said: “And you shall be lost among the nations” | Makkot 24a:31 | <b>Moses said: “And you shall be lost among the nations”</b> (Leviticus 26:38). <b>Isaiah came</b> and revoked it, <b>and said: “And it shall be on that day the great shofar shall be sounded,</b> and those lost in the land of Assyria shall come” (Isaiah 27:13). |
| Leviticus 26:39 | “And also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them” | Sanhedrin 27b:18 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“And also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them”</b> (Leviticus 26:39), is referring to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is referring specifically to a case <b>where they adopt</b> the actions of their ancestors, <b>or</b> perhaps it applies even <b>where they do not adopt</b> their ancestors’ actions? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “Every man shall be put to death for his own sin,”</b> the Torah explicates that one is not put to death if he did not sin. Therefore, the verse in Leviticus is clearly referring to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b> |
| Leviticus 26:43 | until: “And My statutes were abhorred by their soul [ nafsham ]” | Bava Batra88b:11 | <b>And He cursed them with eight</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And if [<i>ve’im</i>] you shall reject My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:15), <b>until: “And My statutes were abhorred by their soul [<i>nafsham</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:43), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. There are eight letters in the Hebrew alphabet from the letter <i>vav</i> to the letter <i>mem</i>, inclusive. |
| Leviticus 26:43 | And it is written: “Even because they rejected My ordinances, | Shabbat 33a:2 | Furthermore, the Sages said that <b>due to the sin of delay of justice,</b> i.e., judges delay issuing their rulings due to personal considerations, <b>and</b> for <b>distortion of justice,</b> i.e., judges intentionally distort their verdicts, <b>and</b> for <b>miscarriage of justice</b> that results from negligence, <b>and</b> for <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, violence and looting abound</b> in the world, <b>and pestilence and famine come, and people eat and are not sated, and they eat their bread</b> measured <b>by weight.

The study of Torah is the mitzva practiced both day and night. <b>And it is written</b> with regard to this punishment: <b>“When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake</b> your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied” (Leviticus 26:26). <b>And it is written: “Even because they rejected My ordinances,</b> and their soul abhorred My statutes” (Leviticus 26:43). All of these punishments result from breaching the covenant of the Torah and the perversion of justice. |
| Leviticus 26:44 | I will not reject them, nor will I abhor them, | Megillah 11a:11 | <b>And Shmuel said</b> his introduction from here: “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, <b>I will not reject them, nor will I abhor them,</b> to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God” (Leviticus 26:44). Shmuel explains: <b>“I will not reject them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Greeks. “Nor will I abhor them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of</b> Vespasian. <b>“To destroy them utterly”;</b> this was <b>in the days of Haman. “To break My covenant with them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Persians. “For I am the Lord their God”;</b> this is <b>in the days of Gog and Magog.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:2 | living people” | Arakhin 20a:20 | § The mishna teaches that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>valuation of my head, or: The valuation of my liver, he gives the valuation of his entire</b> self. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “A valuation of <b>living people”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), which indicates that in the case of one who valuates an item upon which the soul is dependent and without which one will die, he must give the valuation of his entire self. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | What is the reason? | Arakhin 20a:24 | The mishna further teaches that one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my assessment, gives</b> half of his assessment. But one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the assessment of half of me, gives the assessment of his entire</b> self, as one who takes a vow of assessment with regard to an item upon which the soul depends must give the assessment of his entire self. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> After all, it is only with regard to valuations that the Torah states: “A valuation of living people” (Leviticus 27:2), indicating that one who valuates an item upon which the soul depends must give the valuation of his entire self; but this is not stated with regard to assessments. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | a vow [ neder ] with regard to a valuation [ be’erkekha ] of living people” | Arakhin 20a:25 | The Gemara answers that <b>it is written:</b> “When a man shall clearly utter <b>a vow [<i>neder</i>] with regard to a valuation [<i>be’erkekha</i>] of living people”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). The verse juxtaposes vows of assessment [<i>neder</i>] and valuations [<i>erekh</i>], thereby teaching that just as one who takes a vow of valuation with regard to an item upon which the soul depends must give the valuation of his entire self, so too, one who takes a vow of assessment with regard to an item upon which the soul is dependent must give the assessment of his entire self. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | according to your valuation” | Arakhin 2a:6 | The Gemara explains why this addition is necessary: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), which juxtaposes one who is valuated to one who is the object of a vow, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., if he vows to pay his assessment he must pay it to the Temple, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations. But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Since these people, a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils, are not subject to assessment, as they have no market value, perhaps they are also not subject to valuation. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | according to your valuation” | Arakhin 4a:17 | The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). The term serves <b>to include an unspecified valuation,</b> as explained below. <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse teaches that <b>one gives the valuation of his entire</b> self <b>and not the valuation of</b> his <b>limbs.</b> If someone vows that he will give the valuation of a limb, he is not obligated to give anything. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | whether a man or a woman, | Arakhin 4b:1 | <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies in a case of <b>a man who valuated</b> another, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man,</b> or <b>a woman who valuated a woman?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation,” to include women. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | whether a man or a woman, | Arakhin 4b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can expound the plural form of <b>“persons”</b> as follows: Were the verse to have written only: A person, one might have said that <b>I can</b> derive <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a man who valuates</b> anyone, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man clearly utters a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man, or a woman who valuated a woman? The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to include women. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | “Then your valuation shall be” | Arakhin 4b:21 | § The <i>baraita</i> also teaches that the phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include them in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments?</b> Even <b>let</b> this <b>be</b> considered <b>only</b> like the <b>assessment of a tree; were</b> one to <b>say: The assessment of</b> that <b>tree</b> is incumbent upon me, <b>is he not</b> obligated to <b>give</b> its assessment? |
| Leviticus 27:2 | according to your valuation” | Arakhin 4b:3 | This derivation is necessary <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse states: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), it is juxtaposing a person who is valuated and one who is the object of a vow. Therefore, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., one who is obligated to pay his assessment to the Temple if he takes such a vow, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> If he vows to pay his valuation, he must pay. <b>But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Having no market value, these people are not subject to assessment, and are consequently also not subject to valuation. <b>The verse,</b> therefore, <b>states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> teaching that anyone who has any amount of life [<i>nefesh</i>] is subject to valuation. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | according to your valuation” | Arakhin 4b:6 | § <b>The Master said</b> above in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include an unspecified valuation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>an unspecified valuation?</b> |
| Leviticus 27:2 | “A man” | Arakhin 5b:12 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the verses should be interpreted in the reverse manner: <b>“The children of Israel,” can be</b> the object <b>of a valuation but gentiles cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that gentiles <b>cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: <b>“A man”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | The Sages taught | Arakhin 5b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the reasoning for the rulings of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. It is written in the beginning of the passage in the Torah delineating valuations: “Speak to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 27:2). This teaches that <b>“the children of Israel” can take</b> a vow of <b>valuation, but gentiles cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:2 | a man | Arakhin 5b:9 | One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that gentiles <b>cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:2 | a vow according to your valuation” | Bava Metzia114a:4 | <b>Rabbi Ya’akov in the name of bar Padda, and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Ilfa,</b> each <b>say:</b> It is an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a debtor: And if</b> for <b>a debtor, to</b> whom one <b>returns</b> his collateral, they do <b>not make arrangements</b> for the payment of his debt, then in the case of <b>consecration, where</b> they do <b>not return</b> his collateral, <b>is it not logical that</b> they should <b>not make arrangements</b> for the payment of his debt? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It <b>is written:</b> “When a man shall clearly utter <b>a vow according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). In this verse, all vows of consecrated property are juxtaposed to valuations, teaching that <b>just as</b> they <b>make arrangements</b> for the payment of a debt with regard to <b>valuations, so too</b> they <b>make arrangements</b> for the payment of a debt with regard to any vow of <b>consecration.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:2 | clearly utter | Chagigah 10a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of the dissolution of vows <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “When</b> a man shall <b>clearly utter</b> a vow” (Leviticus 27:2), and: <b>“When</b> either man or woman shall <b>clearly utter</b> a vow” (Numbers 6:2), i.e., the words “clearly utter” appear <b>twice. One clear utterance is for prohibition,</b> i.e., when one states his intention to accept the vow, <b>and one clear utterance is for dissolution,</b> when he provides the Sage with a reason why the vow should no longer apply. This is an allusion in the Torah to the annulment of vows. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | a man | Nazir 61a:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that gentiles <b>cannot be</b> the subject <b>of a valuation</b> either, i.e., if a Jew says: I am obligated to give the value of so-and-so the gentile, his vow would not take effect. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. Inasmuch as the Torah also states with regard to a nazirite: “When a man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite” (Numbers 6:2), perhaps one should include gentiles in the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship as well. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | valuations, as it is written: “Speak to the children of Israel” | Nazir 61a:9 | The Gemara returns to the earlier exposition of the verse. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the verse specifies: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel,” but not to the gentiles.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And anywhere that “Israel” is written,</b> are <b>gentiles not</b> included in that verse? <b>But</b> there is a counterexample in the verse written <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations, as it is written: “Speak to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), <b>and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The children of Israel can take a valuation vow but gentiles cannot take a valuation vow.</b> If a gentile declares: I undertake to donate the value of so-and-so, his vow does not take effect. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | the children of Israel” | Nazir 61b:6 | <b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason why a gentile cannot become a nazirite, even though he is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of valuations, and despite the fact that the term “man” appears in both passages. <b>Granted, with regard to valuations, as it is stated:</b> “Speak to <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), one can derive that <b>the children of Israel can take a valuation vow but gentiles cannot take a valuation vow.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that gentiles <b>cannot be valuated</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Man”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), so as to include a gentile in only one aspect of the <i>halakhot</i> of valuations, i.e., that a gentile can be the subject of a valuation. This does not negate the derivation from “the children of Israel” that gentiles are generally excluded. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | upon which to lean, as it is stated: “When a man shall clearly utter | Nazir 62a:12 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of dissolution of vows <b>have</b> a basis <b>upon which to lean, as it is stated: “When a man shall clearly utter</b> a vow” (Leviticus 27:2) and: <b>“When</b> a man or woman <b>shall clearly utter</b> a vow” (Numbers 6:2), <b>twice. One explicit utterance is for prohibition,</b> i.e., when one takes a vow, he is bound to keep it, <b>and one explicit utterance is for dissolution,</b> i.e., in the event that he provides a halakhic authority with a reason why the vow should no longer apply, the vow can be dissolved and he will no longer be bound by it. This is an allusion in the Torah for the dissolution of vows. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | according to your valuation” | Nazir 62a:2 | § The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), stated <b>with regard to valuations,</b> from which it is derived that gentiles are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of valuations? <b>After all, aren’t valuations juxtaposed to vows, as the verse states: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation.” And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> a verse dealing with <b>vows:</b> “Any <b>man [<i>ish</i>]</b> from the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who sacrifices his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which are sacrificed to the Lord as a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 22:18), <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the extra emphasis: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: This serves <b>to include the gentiles, that they can take a vow</b> for <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings <b>like a Jew.</b> It can be derived from this juxtaposition that gentiles are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | This works out well according to the one who says | Nazir 62a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that it is inferred from the phrase: “The children of Israel” (Leviticus 27:2), that <b>Jews can be valuated but gentiles cannot be valuated;</b> and one <b>might</b> have thought that gentiles <b>cannot take a valuation vow.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Man.”</b> According to this opinion it is <b>fine,</b> as the phrase “when a man shall clearly utter a vow” can teach that if a gentile close to adulthood grasps the meaning of vows, he can take a valuation vow. |
| Leviticus 27:2 | according to your valuation” | Temurah 3a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> a gentile <b>cannot render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for one he has consecrated. The Gemara cites the source for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to substitutions: <b>“He shall not exchange it, nor substitute</b> it” (Leviticus 27:10), <b>and it is written at the beginning of the matter: “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). Since the passage specifically addresses the children of Israel, the <i>halakhot</i> of substitution apply only to them, not to gentiles. |
| Leviticus 27:3 | “Then your valuation shall be” | Arakhin 4b:4 | A <i>baraita</i> teaches that the apparently superfluous phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:3), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. If one assesses a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, he is obligated to give that assessment. The <i>baraita</i> explains <b>that</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse states: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation,” anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments, but anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be,”</b> to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in the <i>halakha</i> of assessment. |
| Leviticus 27:3 | “The male” | Arakhin 4b:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: This <i>halakha</i>, that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuation, is derived from the term: <b>“The male”</b> (Leviticus 27:3). The definite article teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to <b>a male, and not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>should not be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a man, but</b> they <b>should be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be for the male…and if it be a female”</b> (Leviticus 27:3–4). This teaches that valuation applies only to <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> who are categorized as neither male nor female. |
| Leviticus 27:3 | fifty | Arakhin 4b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that one who does not specify a person should give <b>fifty</b> shekels, which is the largest of the valuations, that of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty (Leviticus 27:3)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This ruling is based on the principle that if <b>you grasped a lot you did not grasp</b> anything, but if <b>you grasped a little, you grasped</b> something. In other words, if one can derive two sums from the verses, one should choose the smaller number, as it is included within the larger number and is therefore considered certain. |
| Leviticus 27:3 | fifty | Arakhin 7b:18 | The mishna further teaches: <b>Nor</b> can one be charged <b>more than fifty <i>sela</i>.</b> This is the highest valuation specified in the Torah, <b>as it is written:</b> “Then your valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old unto sixty years old, your valuation shall be <b>fifty</b> shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:3). |
| Leviticus 27:3 | fifty | Arakhin 7b:19 | § The mishna teaches that if <b>there were five <i>sela</i> in</b> the <b>possession</b> of the destitute person, Rabbi Meir says: He gives only one <i>sela</i> and thereby fulfills his obligation, and the Rabbis say: He gives all five. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> with regard to a male between the ages of twenty and sixty: “Your valuation shall be <b>fifty</b> shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:3), and the verses likewise specify the valuations for other individuals. <b>And it is</b> also <b>written:</b> “Your valuations shall be according to the <b>shekel</b> of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:25). This teaches that the valuation is <b>either fifty</b> shekels for one who vows to donate the valuation of a man between twenty and sixty, <b>or</b> one <b>shekel,</b> if he cannot afford to pay fifty. |
| Leviticus 27:3 | the male” | Bekhorot 42a:1 | <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “Then your valuation shall be for <b>the male”</b> (Leviticus 27:3), includes one whose status as a male is certain <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Omit from</b> this <i>baraita</i> the mention of <b>a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> as it is referring only to a hermaphrodite, which is a distinct entity. |
| Leviticus 27:3 | the male | Shabbat 136b:5 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that he is not valuated? As it was taught</b> in the <i>Sifra</i>, the halakhic midrash on Leviticus, with regard to the verse: “Then your valuation shall be for <b>the male</b> from the age of twenty years until the age of sixty years, your valuation shall be fifty shekel of silver, after the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:3). The Sages inferred: “The male” means the definite male <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that these <b>shall not be</b> valuated according to <b>the valuation of a man, but shall be</b> valuated according to <b>the valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The male,”</b> and in the following verse: <b>“And if she is a female,</b> then your valuation shall be thirty shekels” (Leviticus 27:4), indicating: Only <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> which are categorized as neither male nor female. |
| Leviticus 27:4 | a female, | Bekhorot 42a:2 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the continuation of that <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that these <b>shall not be</b> valuated according to <b>the valuation of a man, but</b> they <b>shall be</b> valuated according to <b>the valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The male,”</b> and in the following verse it states: “And <b>if</b> she is <b>a female,</b> then your valuation shall be thirty shekels” (Leviticus 27:4), indicating only one whose status as a male or female is certain, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> which are categorized as neither male nor female. The Gemara again answers: <b>Omit from</b> this <i>baraita</i> the mention of <b>a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> as it is referring only to a hermaphrodite. |
| Leviticus 27:4 | “And if she is a female, | Shabbat 136b:5 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that he is not valuated? As it was taught</b> in the <i>Sifra</i>, the halakhic midrash on Leviticus, with regard to the verse: “Then your valuation shall be for <b>the male</b> from the age of twenty years until the age of sixty years, your valuation shall be fifty shekel of silver, after the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:3). The Sages inferred: “The male” means the definite male <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that these <b>shall not be</b> valuated according to <b>the valuation of a man, but shall be</b> valuated according to <b>the valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The male,”</b> and in the following verse: <b>“And if she is a female,</b> then your valuation shall be thirty shekels” (Leviticus 27:4), indicating: Only <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> which are categorized as neither male nor female. |
| Leviticus 27:5 | from five years old until twenty years old, | Arakhin 18b:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the opinion in the mishna is in accordance with that of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>the verses offset each other,</b> and therefore their meaning is unclear without the verbal analogy. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Since it is written: “From one month old until five years old”</b> (Leviticus 27:6), this ostensibly includes the fifth year within the stated category. If so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> mention of five years <b>as well:</b> “And if it is <b>from five years old until twenty years old,</b> then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels” (Leviticus 27:5)? <b>Therefore,</b> with regard to the fifth year, as both verses mention that year, <b>the</b> verses <b>offset each other.</b> Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the verbal analogy is necessary. |
| Leviticus 27:6 | Since it is written: “From one month old until five years old” | Arakhin 18b:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the opinion in the mishna is in accordance with that of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>the verses offset each other,</b> and therefore their meaning is unclear without the verbal analogy. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Since it is written: “From one month old until five years old”</b> (Leviticus 27:6), this ostensibly includes the fifth year within the stated category. If so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> mention of five years <b>as well:</b> “And if it is <b>from five years old until twenty years old,</b> then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels” (Leviticus 27:5)? <b>Therefore,</b> with regard to the fifth year, as both verses mention that year, <b>the</b> verses <b>offset each other.</b> Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the verbal analogy is necessary. |
| Leviticus 27:6 | three shekels, | Arakhin 4b:7 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>an unspecified valuation,</b> without specifying any particular person, <b>gives</b> the amount <b>of the smallest of the valuations. And how much is the smallest of the valuations?</b> It is <b>three shekels,</b> which is the valuation of a female who is younger than five years old (Leviticus 27:6). |
| Leviticus 27:7 | preceding them. As it is stated: “And if it is from sixty years old and upward” | Arakhin 18a:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Torah provides three age categories that determine the amount of the valuation: From the age of one month until age five, from age five until age twenty, and from age twenty until age sixty. For anyone less than one month old there is no valuation. The halakhic status of the <b>thirtieth day</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> thirty days, and therefore the one who took the vow is exempt. Likewise, the halakhic status of the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding them. As it is stated: “And if it is from sixty years old and upward”</b> (Leviticus 27:7), and <b>we derive all</b> the other age categories <b>from</b> the <b>sixtieth year: Just as</b> the halakhic status of the <b>sixtieth year,</b> where upward is written, is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding it, so too,</b> the halakhic status of the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding them.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:7 | “year” | Arakhin 18a:15 | Therefore, <b>the verse states “year”</b> with regard to the fifth and twentieth years (see Leviticus 27:3–6), and <b>“year”</b> with regard to the sixtieth year (Leviticus 27:7), <b>for a verbal analogy. Just as</b> the halakhic status of the <b>year stated with regard to</b> the <b>sixtieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> it, <b>so too,</b> the halakhic status of the <b>year stated with regard to</b> the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> them, <b>both</b> in order <b>to be lenient and</b> in order <b>to be stringent. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Their halakhic status remains like that of the period preceding it, <b>until they will be</b> aged one <b>month and one day beyond the</b> fifth, twentieth, and sixtieth <b>years.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:7 | “upward” | Arakhin 18b:5 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Their halakhic status remains like that of the period preceding it, <b>until they will be</b> aged one <b>month and one day beyond the</b> respective <b>years.</b> With regard to this opinion, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to valuations, <b>“upward”</b> (Leviticus 27:7), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the census of the Levites in the wilderness: “From <b>one month old and upward</b> you shall number them” (Numbers 3:15). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the census, the verse means: <b>From one month and one day old, so too here,</b> with regard to valuations, the verse means that each respective category is counted <b>from</b> one <b>month and one day old</b> beyond the stated ages of five years, twenty years, or sixty years. |
| Leviticus 27:7 | valuations, | Bava Batra121b:11 | <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The <b>decree</b> of death <b>was not decreed either upon</b> those <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old or upon</b> those <b>more than sixty</b> years <b>old</b> at the time of the sin of the spies. The Gemara explains: <b>Not upon</b> those <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old, as it is written: “From twenty years old and upward”</b> (Numbers 14:29). <b>And not upon</b> those <b>more than sixty</b> years <b>old,</b> because he <b>learns</b> that there is a verbal analogy between <b>“and upward”</b> in the verse cited, and <b>“and upward” from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations,</b> in the phrase: “From sixty years old and upward” (Leviticus 27:7). <b>Just as there,</b> concerning valuations, <b>more than sixty</b> years <b>old is comparable to less than twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> as there is a distinct category of those between the ages of twenty and sixty, <b>so too here, more than sixty</b> years <b>old is comparable to less than twenty</b> years <b>old</b> insofar as those older were not subject to the sentence. Yair, son of Manasseh, who was already older, did not die in the wilderness. |
| Leviticus 27:7 | valuations: | Bekhorot 49a:7 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva is uncertain</b> in this regard, as one could claim: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to write “and upward” with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>valuations:</b> “And if it be from sixty years old and upward” (Leviticus 27:7), <b>and</b> it <b>is not derived from</b> the redemption of the Israelite firstborns in the <b>wilderness</b> that the phrase “from…years old” means “and upward,” one can conclude the following: The redemption of the firstborn in the wilderness and valuations <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | as it is written: “According to the means of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him” | Arakhin 17a:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that affordability is determined in accordance with the means of the one taking the vow. The Gemara asks: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>affordability is</b> written in the Torah <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>one who valuates,</b> i.e., one who says he will give the Temple treasury the set sum assigned to a particular individual’s age and sex. Why, then, is the mishna referring to affordability in the context of one pledging another’s worth by taking a vow, in which the obligation is calculated individually rather than by predetermined assigned values? The Gemara answers: The mishna employs the language of the verse, which uses the word “vow,” <b>as it is written: “According to the means of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). |
| Leviticus 27:8 | Affordability, | Arakhin 17a:9 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Affordability,</b> which is written in the Torah: “According to the means of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him” (Leviticus 27:8), is determined <b>in accordance with</b> the means of the <b>one taking the vow, and</b> the sum fixed by the Torah based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow. And the</b> distinction based on sex that is written in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations</b> is stated <b>with regard to the one valuated, and the</b> different <b>valuation</b> based on the age of the one valuated is determined <b>at the time</b> one takes <b>the</b> vow of <b>valuation.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:8 | the means of him who vowed | Arakhin 17b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If he was <b>destitute</b> when he took the oath <b>and he became wealthy,</b> he gives the valuation appropriate for a wealthy individual. The Gemara explains that this is derived from the verse: “According to <b>the means of him who vowed</b> shall the priest valuate him” (Leviticus 27:8), and in this case he had the means of a wealthy individual when he was ready to give the donation. The mishna further teaches that one who was <b>wealthy and became destitute</b> also gives the valuation as though he was wealthy. The Gemara explains that this is derived from the beginning of the same verse: <b>“According to [<i>al pi</i>] the means</b> of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him.” The phrase <i>al pi</i> serves to emphasize the moment when the person uttered the vow with his mouth [<i>peh</i>], and at that moment he was wealthy. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “But if he is too poor for your valuation” | Arakhin 17b:9 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if one made a valuation when he was <b>destitute and he became wealthy and again became destitute, he gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> according to the means of <b>a wealthy person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “But if he is too poor for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). The word order serves to emphasize “he,” which indicates that he is considered poor <b>only if he</b> remains <b>in his</b> state of <b>poverty from his beginning until his end</b> of involvement with the vow. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | “But if he be too poor for your valuation” | Arakhin 24a:1 | <b>“But if he be too poor for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). The word “he” [<i>hu</i>] is interpreted as a variation of <i>havaya</i>, existence or sustenance. In this manner the verse can be read as an instruction to the treasurer: <b>Sustain him from</b> that which he is obligated to pay for <b>your valuation.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:8 | then he shall be set before the priest” | Arakhin 4a:15 | <b>Rather, Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ashi:</b> It <b>was necessary</b> to teach that priests are included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation because <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> concerning valuations: “But if he is too poor for your valuation, <b>then he shall be set before the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:8), this indicates that a poor man is placed before the priest for valuation, <b>but a priest is not</b> placed <b>before</b> another <b>priest</b> for valuation. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that priests are also included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | shall value | Arakhin 4a:19 | Furthermore, one might have thought that <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the dead</b> from valuation, <b>but I should not exclude a moribund</b> person, who is about to die but is still alive, and who is therefore included in the category of “persons.” Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>setting,</b> i.e., he can stand, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuation. And anyone not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>setting,</b> who cannot stand, e.g., one who is on his deathbed, is <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuation.</b> Therefore, one who valuates a moribund individual is not obligated to pay anything. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | shall value | Arakhin 4b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Perhaps <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the dead</b> from valuation, as they no longer possess life [<i>nefesh</i>], <b>but I should not exclude a moribund</b> person, as he is still alive. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that anyone included in the category of setting, i.e., who can stand, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. But one who is on his deathbed is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | valuation. | Arakhin 6b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it makes sense that <b>one who is moribund is not</b> the object of <b>a vow, as he has no monetary</b> value. <b>And</b> it also stands to reason that he <b>is not valuated,</b> as <b>he is not subject to setting,</b> i.e., standing, <b>and</b> therefore is not subject to <b>valuation.</b> The verse states: “Then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that anyone who cannot stand, such as one who is dying, is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who is taken to be executed, granted,</b> he <b>is not</b> the object of <b>a vow, as he has no monetary</b> value, since no one would purchase him. <b>But</b> with regard to the mishna’s statement that he is <b>not valuated, why not?</b> |
| Leviticus 27:8 | the verse states: “According to the means of him that vowed | Arakhin 7b:20 | <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this reasoning? According to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> second verse <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that all valuations that you valuate shall not be less than a shekel,</b> but in a case <b>where</b> the individual <b>has</b> more than a shekel, <b>the verse states: “According to the means of him that vowed</b> shall the priest value him” (Leviticus 27:8), <b>and</b> as <b>he has the means</b> to pay more than a shekel, he is required to pay the maximum that he can afford. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | is written: “But if he is too poor [ makh ] for your valuation” | Bava Metzia114a:10 | § The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Avuh found Elijah standing in a graveyard of gentiles.</b> Rabba bar Avuh <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>making arrangements for the debtor?</b> Elijah <b>said to him:</b> A verbal analogy is <b>derived from</b> the usage of the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of a debtor and the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of <b>valuations.</b> With regard to <b>valuations,</b> it <b>is written: “But if he is too poor [<i>makh</i>] for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8), and <b>with regard to a creditor,</b> it <b>is written: “But if your brother be poor [<i>yamukh</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:35). |
| Leviticus 27:8 | valuations | Bava Metzia114a:2 | § <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>making arrangements for the debtor</b> so that he will retain some of his possessions so that he may continue living as before, albeit at a slightly lower standard? The issue on which this is based is <b>whether or not</b> a verbal analogy is <b>derived from</b> the usage of the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of a debtor (Leviticus 25:35) and the term <b>“poor”</b> written in the context of <b>valuations</b> (Leviticus 27:8), as the Gemara will discuss further at the end of the <i>amud</i>. |
| Leviticus 27:8 | The verse states: “But if he is too poor for your valuation | Bava Metzia114a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But they should make arrangements for a debtor</b> based on an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations,</b> as follows: <b>And if</b> in the case of <b>valuations</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> they do <b>not return</b> his collateral and yet they do <b>make arrangements</b> for the payment of his debt, then with regard to <b>a debtor,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> one does <b>return</b> his collateral, <b>is it not logical that</b> they should <b>make arrangements</b> for the payment of his debt? The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “But if he is too poor for your valuation</b>…and the priest shall value him, according to the means of the one that vowed shall the priest value him” (Leviticus 27:8). The Torah emphasizes that this <i>halakha</i> is applicable only to <b>“he”</b> who makes a valuation, <b>but not</b> to <b>a debtor.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:8 | poverty. | Kiddushin 17a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derive,</b> like Rabbi Yehuda, the verbal analogy between <b>“giving”</b> and <b>“giving” from</b> the verses discussing the goring of a Canaanite <b>slave,</b> teaching that <b>just as there</b> he pays <b>thirty, so too here,</b> he pays <b>thirty?</b> The Gemara adds that there are two reasons to prefer this derivation, as stated above: <b>One</b> reason is <b>that if you grasped too much, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped a bit, you grasped</b> something. <b>And furthermore, one should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a slave from</b> another case involving <b>a slave.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>poverty</b> and <b>poverty.</b> With regard to valuations the Torah states: “But if he is too poor” (Leviticus 27:8), and concerning a Hebrew slave the verse says: “And if your brother grows poor” (Leviticus 25:39). |
| Leviticus 27:8 | nothing other than poor, as it is stated: “But if he be too poor [ makh ] for the valuation” | Megillah 11a:6 | <b>Rabbi Elazar introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Through laziness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] sink in [<i>yimakh</i>]; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:18). Rabbi Elazar interprets the verse homiletically: <b>Through the laziness of the Jewish people, who did not occupy themselves with Torah</b> study, <b>the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a euphemism for God Himself, <b>became poor [<i>makh</i>],</b> so that, as it were, He was unable to help them, <b>as <i>makh</i></b> is <b>nothing other than poor, as it is stated: “But if he be too poor [<i>makh</i>] for the valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And</b> the word <b><i>mekare</i></b> in the verse <b>is referring</b> to <b>no</b> one <b>other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of His chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3). |
| Leviticus 27:8 | poor, as it is stated: “But if he is too poor [ makh ] for your valuation” | Taanit 7b:10 | <b>Rav Ketina said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated: “By slothfulness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] will sink in [<i>yimakh</i>],</b> and through idleness of the hands the house leaks” (Ecclesiastes 10:18). <b>Due to slothfulness that was</b> present <b>amongst the Jewish people, that they did not occupy</b> themselves <b>with Torah, the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a euphemism for God Himself, has <b>sunk. And sunk [<i>makh</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>poor, as it is stated: “But if he is too poor [<i>makh</i>] for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And “rafters [<i>mekare</i>]”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than a reference to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of Your upper chambers in the water”</b> (Psalms 104:3). |
| Leviticus 27:9 | anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred” | Arakhin 5a:1 | <b>The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all of</b> the animal <b>will be a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, <b>anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The verse indicates that the part <b>of it</b> that one gives will be <b>sacred, but not all of</b> the animal will be <b>sacred.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:9 | becomes a burnt offering? The verse states: “All that any man give of such to the Lord shall be holy” | Arakhin 5a:3 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, all of</b> the animal <b>becomes a burnt offering? The verse states: “All that any man give of such to the Lord shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The term “shall be” serves <b>to include all of</b> the animal, indicating that it all becomes sacred. |
| Leviticus 27:9 | anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred” | Chullin 69b:5 | Rabbi Yosei clearly disagrees with the opinion that substituting a limb is not possible. But Rabbi Yosei’s formulation indicates that even according to that opinion, if a single limb is consecrated then the entire animal becomes consecrated. The Gemara clarifies: <b>To whom is</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>responding? If we say</b> he is responding <b>to Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, do they accept this reasoning? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, all of it will be a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, <b>anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The verse indicates that the part <b>of it</b> that one gives will be <b>sacred, but all of it</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>sacred.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:9 | anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred” | Temurah 11b:1 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that if <b>one says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering,</b> the sanctity should extend to the whole animal and <b>all of</b> the animal <b>will be a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, <b>anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The verse indicates that the part <b>of it</b> that one gives will be sacred <b>unto the Lord, and not all of</b> the animal will be sacred <b>unto the Lord.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:9 | what is | Temurah 11b:11 | § According to Rabbi Yosei, if one consecrates one limb of an animal the sanctity extends to the entire animal. <b>Rava raises a dilemma: With regard to a bird</b> that is fit for sacrifice, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> according to this opinion? Since this <i>halakha</i> is derived, as stated above, from the verse: “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:9), one can contend that <b>the Merciful One states “animal,” and this</b> bird is <b>not</b> considered <b>an animal. Or perhaps</b> one should stress that <b>the Merciful One states “offering,” and this</b> bird is <b>also</b> considered <b>an offering.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Leviticus 27:9 | is a burnt offering, that all of it becomes a burnt offering? Since it is stated: “All that any man give of such to the Lord | Temurah 11b:3 | <b>But Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: From where</b> is it derived in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, that all of it becomes a burnt offering? Since it is stated: “All that any man give of such to the Lord</b> shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:9), one might have thought that individual limbs can be consecrated. <b>When it says: “Shall be sacred,”</b> this phrase serves <b>to include all of</b> the animal, indicating that it all becomes sacred. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | he shall substitute [ hamer yamir ] | Arakhin 2a:15 | <b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive their opinion? The verse states: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), with the doubled form of <i>hamer yamir</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one capable of effecting substitution. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>derive the final stage of consecration,</b> i.e., the placing of hands, <b>from the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration an heir can effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir can place hands.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | “And if | Arakhin 2b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they learn that a woman can perform substitution? The Gemara answers: They derive it <b>from</b> the extra “and” in the phrase: <b>“And if</b> he shall substitute” (Leviticus 27:10). <b>But Rabbi Yehuda does not expound</b> the extra “and” in the term <b>“and if”</b> at all. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | exchange. And likewise it says: “He may neither exchange it nor substitute it” | Bava Metzia47a:14 | The Gemara comments: This dispute between Rav and Levi is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The verse states: <b>“Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redemption and concerning substitution, to confirm all matters; a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor”</b> (Ruth 4:7). The verse is interpreted: <b>“Redemption”; that is a sale. And likewise it says:</b> “Neither shall be sold <b>nor shall be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). <b>“Substitution”; that is</b> the transaction of <b>exchange. And likewise it says: “He may neither exchange it nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). |
| Leviticus 27:10 | when it is blemished, as it is written: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it, | Bekhorot 14b:10 | The Gemara persists: But <b>say</b> that one should <b>apply</b> Deuteronomy 17:1 <b>to</b> the <b>matter of</b> animals <b>substituted for sacrificial</b> animals, <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> a substitute becomes <b>sacred</b> even <b>when it is blemished, as it is written: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it,</b> a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all substitute animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy” (Leviticus 27:10), <b>it may likewise be sacrificed when it is blemished.</b> The verse in Deuteronomy would therefore <b>teach us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, as a blemished substitute cannot be sacrificed upon the altar. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | as the verse states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it, | Bekhorot 14b:14 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> sacrificial animals whose blemish preceded their consecration <b>do not render</b> an animal that was <b>a substitute</b> for them sacred. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it,</b> a good for a bad, or a bad for a good” (Leviticus 27:10). The Gemara infers: <b>Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that substituting <b>a bad</b> animal <b>for a good</b> animal is <b>not</b> permitted, <b>is it necessary</b> to state that substituting <b>a good</b> animal <b>for a bad</b> animal is <b>not</b> permitted? <b>Rather,</b> the verse is teaching that an animal which is <b>good at the outset renders</b> an animal that was <b>a subsitute</b> for it sacred, but an animal that is <b>bad at the outset,</b> i.e., whose blemish preceded its consecration, <b>does not render</b> an animal that was <b>a subsitute</b> for it sacred. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | ab initio ? But isn’t it written: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good” | Chullin 2a:3 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: And</b> does <b>every</b> use of the term: <b>Everyone,</b> indicate that the action in question is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? If that is so,</b> in the mishna (<i>Temura</i> 2a), where it says: <b>Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a sacrificial animal, <b>both men and women, is</b> that <b>also</b> an expression indicating <b>that</b> it is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? But isn’t it written: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good”</b> (Leviticus 27:10)? |
| Leviticus 27:10 | for | Chullin 69a:20 | The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that the phrase: Every animal of the animals, is referring to a fetus, then one should be able to <b>substitute</b> a non-sacred animal <b>for</b> the sanctified fetus of a pregnant offering, i.e., the non-sacred animal should become consecrated through the attempt to do so. This is because the verse referring to substitution also uses that phrase: “And if he shall substitute an animal for an animal [<i>behema bivhema</i>], it and its substitute shall be consecrated” (Leviticus 27:10). There too, the phrase “an animal for an animal” translates literally as: An animal in an animal. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | “And if” | Menachot 93a:10 | <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, they derive</b> that a woman can effect substitution <b>from</b> the term: <b>“And if”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), in the phrase “and if he shall substitute.” <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not expound</b> the term <b>“and if”</b> at all. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | he shall substitute [ hamer yamir ] | Menachot 93a:6 | <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive their opinion? The verse states: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), with the doubled form of <i>hamer yamir</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one capable of effecting substitution. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>they derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning who performs the rite of placing hands, which is the <b>final stage of consecration, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning who can effect substitution, which is <b>an initial stage of consecration: Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir can effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir places</b> his <b>hands.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | that one cannot effect, | Temurah 10b:11 | Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> bar Padda’s opinion from the mishna: <b>One does not substitute</b> non-sacred <b>limbs for</b> consecrated <b>fetuses, and</b> likewise one does <b>not</b> substitute non-sacred <b>fetuses for</b> consecrated <b>limbs,</b> or non-sacred limbs or fetuses for whole consecrated animals, or non-sacred whole animals for consecrated limbs or fetuses. One may infer from the mishna that <b>it is a substitution</b> of fetuses <b>that one cannot effect,</b> as the Torah states with regard to substitution: “And if he substitutes an animal for an animal” (Leviticus 27:10), and a fetus is not classified as an animal. But if one <b>consecrates</b> fetuses directly, not in the manner of substitution, they are <b>consecrated,</b> contrary to the opinion of bar Padda. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | “He shall not alter it, nor substitute it, good for bad, | Temurah 13a:15 | § The mishna teaches that consecrated animals belonging to the community or to partners are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of substitution. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the animal tithe: <b>“He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, neither shall he substitute it;</b> and if he substitute it at all, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred; it shall not be redeemed” (Leviticus 27:33). <b>Why is</b> the issue of substitution <b>stated</b> here in connection to the animal tithe? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> earlier: <b>“He shall not alter it, nor substitute it, good for bad,</b> or bad for good, and if he substitutes an animal for an animal, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:10)? |
| Leviticus 27:10 | and that for which it is substituted | Temurah 13a:4 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And a substitute</b> animal that was consecrated when it was substituted for a consecrated animal <b>does not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute;</b> rather, it remains non-sacred. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., the source for this <i>halakha</i> in the Torah? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if he substitutes an animal for an animal, then both it <b>and that for which it is substituted</b> shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:10). The verse teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of substitution applies only to a consecrated animal and its substitute, <b>but not the substitute of its substitute.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | it | Temurah 13a:5 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And the offspring</b> born of a consecrated animal that was not consecrated itself <b>does not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute.</b> The Gemara explains: The reason for this is <b>that the verse states:</b> “Then both <b>it</b> and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:10), which teaches that only <b>it,</b> a consecrated animal, <b>but not</b> its <b>offspring,</b> renders a non-sacred animal exchanged for it a substitute. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | “an animal” is stated | Temurah 13a:7 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The birds</b> sacrificed as offerings, i.e., doves and pigeons, <b>and the meal offerings do not render</b> non-sacred items exchanged for them <b>substitutes, as only</b> the term <b>“an animal” is stated</b> with regard to substitution, in the verse: “And if he substitutes an animal for an animal” (Leviticus 27:10). A consecrated animal belonging to <b>the community or</b> to <b>partners does not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“He shall neither exchange it nor substitute</b> it.” One derives from the singular pronoun in the verse that <b>an individual renders</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute, but the community and partners do not render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute.</b> Items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance do not render</b> non-sacred items exchanged for them <b>substitutes.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | shall be holy” | Temurah 17a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that substitution applies whether one substitutes unwittingly or intentionally? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “He shall not alter it, nor substitute it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall substitute his animal for an animal, then both it and that for which it is changed <b>shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). The apparently superfluous term “shall be” serves <b>to include</b> the case of one who acts <b>unwittingly like</b> that of one who acts <b>intentionally,</b> with regard to substitution. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | if he shall at all substitute [ hamer yamir ] | Temurah 2a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reasoning</b> of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>an inheritor</b> can <b>effect substitution?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Meir could <b>say to you</b> that the repetition of the verb in the verse: “And <b>if he shall at all substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), serves <b>to include the inheritor.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | before the mishna poses a difficulty for you, the verse should pose a difficulty for you, as it is written: “He shall not alter it, nor substitute it” | Temurah 2a:3 | The Gemara responds: <b>And can you understand</b> the phrase: <b>Everyone substitutes,</b> as indicating that substitution may be performed <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> If so, <b>before the mishna poses a difficulty for you, the verse should pose a difficulty for you, as it is written: “He shall not alter it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). The verse clearly states that it is prohibited to perform substitution. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | speak only in the masculine, as it is stated: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it” | Temurah 2b:2 | The Gemara asks: According to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that an inheritor is not able to effect substitution, <b>what does he do with this</b> repetitive language in the verse: <b>“And if he shall at all substitute”?</b> How does he interpret it? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to include a woman</b> as able to effect substitution and to incur the penalty of forty lashes for doing so. <b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the verses concerning <b>the entire matter</b> of substitution <b>speak only in the masculine, as it is stated: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>a woman</b> is included? <b>The verse states: “And if he shall at all substitute,” to include a woman.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute | Temurah 3a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> a gentile <b>cannot render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for one he has consecrated. The Gemara cites the source for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to substitutions: <b>“He shall not exchange it, nor substitute</b> it” (Leviticus 27:10), <b>and it is written at the beginning of the matter: “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). Since the passage specifically addresses the children of Israel, the <i>halakhot</i> of substitution apply only to them, not to gentiles. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | a positive mitzva, | Temurah 4b:5 | <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>one who effects substitution, which is a prohibition</b> whose violation <b>can be rectified by</b> fulfilling <b>a positive mitzva,</b> as the verse states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy” (Leviticus 27:10). <b>And</b> even so, one who effects substitution <b>is flogged, as we learned</b> in the mishna (2a): That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, the <b>substitution takes effect and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs</b> the punishment of <b>the forty</b> lashes. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | which the Merciful One states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it” | Temurah 5b:2 | The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>substitution,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), <b>and it is taught</b> in the mishna (2a): That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>the substitution takes effect, and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes. <b>Apparently,</b> his action <b>is effective,</b> and this seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | lifetime? Rabbi Akiva said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “Then both it and its substitute shall be sacred” | Temurah 7b:13 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: What</b> is this comparison <b>for him? If</b> a priest <b>does not substitute for a sin offering and a guilt offering, which</b> priests <b>do not acquire during</b> the animals’ <b>lifetimes, will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a firstborn, which</b> priests <b>do acquire during</b> the animal’s <b>lifetime? Rabbi Akiva said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “Then both it and its substitute shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), which juxtaposes the consecration of the consecrated animal with that of its non-sacred substitute? <b>Where is</b> the consecrated animal <b>imbued with sanctity?</b> It is <b>in the house of the owner. So too,</b> the <b>substitute</b> animal is consecrated <b>in the house of the owner.</b> Therefore, the priest cannot substitute for the firstborn that he received because he is not the owner that initially consecrated it. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | as it is stated: “Then both it and its substitute shall be sacred” | Temurah 9a:14 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One substitutes one</b> non-sacred animal <b>for two</b> consecrated animals <b>and two</b> non-sacred animals <b>for one</b> consecrated animal, and one substitutes <b>one</b> non-sacred animal <b>for one hundred</b> consecrated animals <b>and one hundred</b> non-sacred animals <b>for one</b> consecrated animal. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One substitutes only one</b> non-sacred animal <b>for one</b> consecrated animal, <b>as it is stated: “Then both it and its substitute shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). <b>Just as “it”</b> indicates one <b>specific</b> animal, <b>so too,</b> its substitute can be only one <b>specific</b> animal. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | “An animal for an animal” | Temurah 9a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon, the Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“An animal for an animal”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). <b>From here</b> it is derived that <b>one substitutes one</b> non-sacred animal <b>for two</b> consecrated animals <b>and two</b> non-sacred animals <b>for one</b> consecrated animal, and <b>one</b> non-sacred animal <b>for one hundred</b> consecrated animals <b>and one hundred</b> non-sacred animals <b>for one</b> consecrated animal. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One substitutes only one</b> non-sacred animal <b>for one</b> consecrated animal, <b>as it is stated: “An animal [<i>behema</i>] for an animal,” and</b> it is <b>not</b> stated: <b>An animal for animals [<i>bivehemot</i>], nor: Animals for an animal.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:10 | MISHNA: | Temurah 9a:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is written: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good; and if he substitutes an animal for an animal, then both it and its substitute shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:10). The mishna enumerates the consecrated and non-sacred animals this verse applies to. <b>One substitutes</b> for consecrated animals <b>from the flock</b> of sheep or goats, and the sanctity takes effect <b>upon</b> animals from <b>the herd</b> of cattle, <b>and</b> one substitutes <b>from the herd</b> and the sanctity takes effect <b>upon</b> animals from <b>the flock. And</b> one substitutes <b>from the sheep</b> and the sanctity takes effect <b>upon the goats, and from the goats upon the sheep;</b> and <b>from the males upon the females, and from the females upon the males;</b> and <b>from the unblemished</b> animals <b>upon the blemished</b> animals, and <b>from the blemished</b> animals <b>upon the unblemished</b> animals. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | the verse states: “Then both it and its substitute” | Temurah 9a:20 | The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Just as</b> one <b>cannot substitute one</b> animal <b>for two, so too, one cannot effect substitution and then effect substitution again.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as Rabbi Shimon said</b> that one <b>cannot substitute two</b> animals <b>for one, so too, one cannot effect substitution and then effect substitution again.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then both it and its substitute”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), which teaches that one can effect substitution <b>with even one hundred</b> non-sacred animals. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | as it is stated: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good” | Temurah 9a:3 | The source for this is <b>as it is stated: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). <b>And which is</b> the case of <b>good for bad</b> where the substitution takes effect? It is a case where one substitutes for <b>blemished</b> animals <b>whose consecration preceded their blemish.</b> But if an animal was consecrated after it was blemished, substitution for it does not take effect. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | as the Sages taught | Temurah 9a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if he substitutes an animal for an animal, then both it and its substitute shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:10). When the verse states: <b>“An animal for an animal,” from here</b> it is derived <b>that one substitutes</b> for consecrated animals <b>from the flock</b> and the sanctity takes effect <b>upon</b> animals from <b>the herd, and</b> one likewise substitutes <b>from the herd upon</b> animals from <b>the flock;</b> and one substitutes <b>from the sheep</b> and the sanctity takes effect <b>upon the goats, and from the goats upon the sheep; and from the males upon the females and from the females upon the males; and from the blemished</b> animals <b>upon the unblemished</b> animals <b>and from the unblemished</b> animals <b>upon the blemished</b> animals. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | the verse states: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good” | Temurah 9a:5 | One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> for animals whose <b>blemish preceded their consecration.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), <b>and which is</b> the case of <b>good for bad</b> where the substitution takes effect? It is a case of <b>blemished</b> animals <b>whose consecration preceded their blemish.</b> If an animal was consecrated after it was blemished, substitution for it does not take effect. |
| Leviticus 27:10 | the verse states: “If he shall at all change [ hamer yamir ] | Zevachim 6a:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as</b> although <b>the verse states: “If he shall at all change [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), the superfluous word <i>hamer</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one who is able to effect substitution, nevertheless the subject’s singular form teaches that only <b>one</b> heir <b>can effect substitution, but two</b> heirs <b>cannot effect substitution.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:11 | “And if it be any impure animal, of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord” | Bekhorot 37b:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>A temporary blemish</b> is not excluded by the exegesis but <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: Now,</b> if <b>we do not</b> even <b>redeem</b> an offering <b>due to</b> a temporary blemish, <b>will we slaughter</b> a firstborn outside the Temple, for which redemption is not performed, <b>due to</b> a temporary blemish? The Gemara explains the source for this assertion that an offering is not redeemed because of a temporary blemish. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And if it be any impure animal, of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:11). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> ritually pure animals with <b>blemishes.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:11 | the verse states: “Of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord” | Bekhorot 37b:4 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: One <b>might</b> have thought that offerings <b>may be redeemed due to a temporary blemish</b> that they sustained. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:11). This teaches that an animal <b>that is not sacrificed at all</b> is redeemed, which <b>excludes this</b> animal that has a temporary blemish, <b>which is not sacrificed today,</b> but <b>rather</b> may be sacrificed <b>tomorrow.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:11 | “And if it be any impure [ tamei ] animal” | Menachot 101a:3 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse is referring <b>to blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed, or is it</b> referring <b>only to an actual non-kosher [<i>tamei</i>] animal,</b> as the plain sense of the verse indicates? The Gemara responds: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> later in that section: <b>“And if it be of an impure [<i>tamei</i>] animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation,</b> and shall add to it the fifth part thereof” (Leviticus 27:27), an actual <b>non-kosher animal is mentioned</b> as being subject to redemption. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And if it be any impure [<i>tamei</i>] animal”</b> (Leviticus 27:11)? <b>The verse is speaking of blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed,</b> i.e., that have the possibility of being redeemed. |
| Leviticus 27:12 | And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad” | Temurah 33a:4 | § The Gemara analyzes the opinion of Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reasoning of Reish Lakish, who said</b> that according <b>to the Rabbis,</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were included</b> in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> whereas animals <b>consecrated for the altar were not included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation?</b> The reasoning is <b>that the verse states:</b> “Then he shall set the animal before the priest. <b>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad”</b> (Leviticus 27:12). |
| Leviticus 27:14 | consecrate it? The Merciful One states: “When a man shall sanctify his house to be sacred” | Arakhin 21a:1 | If <b>the one living in it,</b> i.e., the renter, <b>consecrates</b> the house, <b>he pays the rent to the Temple</b> treasury. The Gemara express surprise at this last statement of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the one living in</b> the house <b>consecrates</b> it? <b>How can</b> the renter <b>consecrate it? The Merciful One states: “When a man shall sanctify his house to be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived that <b>just as one’s house is in his possession, so too, anything</b> that one consecrates must be <b>in his possession.</b> If so, the renter cannot consecrate the house, as he is not its owner. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>the one renting out the house consecrates it, the one living in it pays the rent to the Temple</b> treasury. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | Just as there, | Arakhin 25b:20 | The Gemara explains: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to one who consecrates a house, where the verse states: “And when a man shall consecrate his house to be holy for the Lord” (Leviticus 27:14), it can be redeemed from the Temple treasury only <b>by</b> payment of <b>money,</b> as the verse concludes: “As the priest shall value it, so shall it stand,” <b>so too here,</b> where the verse states with regard to the priests entering into an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), the priests can enter the field only <b>by</b> payment of <b>money.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:14 | “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord” | Avodah Zarah63a:3 | <b>And if</b> the circumstances are <b>that he did not say to her: Acquire</b> this payment <b>from now, how can she</b> be allowed to <b>sacrifice it? The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived that <b>just as</b> one’s <b>house is in his possession, so too, any</b> item that a person wishes to consecrate must be <b>in his possession.</b> The prostitute cannot consecrate an animal that is not in her possession. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord” | Bava Kamma68b:10 | The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> did the events described in the <i>baraita</i> occur? <b>If we say</b> they happened <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, is</b> the animal <b>consecrated</b> at all? A thief cannot consecrate a stolen item before the owner despairs of recovering it, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And <b>when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <b>Just as one’s house belongs to him, so too, anything</b> that one consecrates must <b>belong to him,</b> and therefore a thief cannot consecrate a stolen item. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | supports it: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord” | Bava Kamma69b:10 | The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan followed the mishna that discusses the double payment <b>because</b> there is <b>a verse</b> that <b>supports it: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <b>Just as one’s house is in his possession, so too anything</b> that one consecrates must <b>be in his possession,</b> excluding items that have been stolen from him. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | And it is written: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be sacred | Bava Metzia6a:18 | <b>Or perhaps</b> the consecration does not take effect, as <b>now, in any event, he did not</b> actually <b>seize</b> the garment and <b>it</b> is not his? <b>And it is written: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be sacred</b> unto God” (Leviticus 27:14), from which the Sages derive: <b>Just as his house is in his possession, so too, anything</b> that one wishes to consecrate must be <b>in his possession, to the exclusion of this</b> garment, <b>which is not in his possession,</b> as he did not actually seize it, and therefore the consecration does not take effect. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | the Merciful One states: “When a man shall sanctify his house to be holy” | Chullin 139a:3 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>merely saw a nest</b> that did not belong to him, <b>and he consecrated it. But</b> this, too, is problematic: <b>Is</b> the nest <b>consecrated</b> in such a case? But <b>the Merciful One states: “When a man shall sanctify his house to be holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), indicating that <b>just as his house</b> is <b>in his possession</b> when he consecrates it, <b>so too, any</b> item that one wishes to consecrate must be <b>in his possession</b> when consecrating it. If so, one cannot consecrate a nest that does not belong to him. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | The Merciful One states: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord” | Temurah 29b:2 | <b>But rather,</b> this must be referring to a case <b>where he said to her:</b> The lamb <b>shall be acquired by you only at the time of intercourse,</b> and yet she went ahead and sacrificed it beforehand. But in this case, <b>can she</b> legally <b>sacrifice</b> the lamb? <b>The Merciful One states: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), which teaches that <b>just as his house is in his possession, so too any</b> item that a person wishes to sanctify must be <b>in his possession.</b> In this case, by contrast, the lamb does not belong to her until they engage in intercourse. |
| Leviticus 27:14 | “When a man shall consecrate his house to be sacred unto the Lord” | Temurah 9a:12 | The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of substituting his animal <b>for that of others? If we say</b> that the <b>consecrated animal</b> is <b>his and</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> animal belongs <b>to others, is he able to consecrate</b> an animal in this manner? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“When a man shall consecrate his house to be sacred unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), which teaches that <b>just as his house is in his possession, so too, any</b> item one desires to consecrate must be <b>in his possession.</b> One cannot consecrate another’s animal. <b>But rather,</b> if we say that the <b>consecrated animal</b> belongs <b>to others, and</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> animal is <b>his, can one effect</b> substitution <b>for an item that is not his?</b> |
| Leviticus 27:15 | it is written: “And if he who consecrated it will redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation | Bava Metzia54b:4 | The Gemara pursues a similar line of inquiry: <b>With regard to consecrated</b> property <b>it is written: “And if he who consecrated it will redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation</b> unto it, and it shall be his” (Leviticus 27:15), <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (55b): <b>One who redeems his</b> own <b>consecrated</b> property that he consecrated himself <b>adds one-fifth</b> to the sum of the redemption. <b>We learned one-fifth; we did not learn one-fifth of the one-fifth. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara elaborates: <b>With regard to <i>teruma</i> it is written: “Then he shall add,”</b> and <b>with regard to consecrated</b> property <b>too, isn’t it written: “Then he shall add”?</b> Apparently, in a case of consecrated property one also pays one-fifth of the one-fifth. |
| Leviticus 27:15 | “Then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation | Bava Metzia54b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this dilemma? <b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Abaye</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to one who redeems a house that he consecrated: <b>“Then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation</b> unto it” (Leviticus 27:15). The Torah <b>juxtaposes its</b> payment of <b>one-fifth to the money of its valuation,</b> i.e., the consecrated house: <b>Just as</b> when redeeming <b>the money of its valuation one adds one-fifth, so too,</b> when redeeming <b>the money of its one-fifth, one adds one-fifth as well.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:15 | the verse states: “And if he who consecrated it will redeem his house, | Bava Metzia54b:8 | § The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: For</b> redemption of <b>first consecration one adds one-fifth; for</b> redemption of <b>second consecration one does not add one-fifth. Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi?</b> It is as <b>the verse states: “And if he who consecrated it will redeem his house,</b> then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation unto it” (Leviticus 27:15), from which it may be inferred that when <b>he who consecrates</b> the house redeems it, he adds one-fifth, <b>but</b> this is <b>not</b> so with regard to <b>one who associates</b> an item with an existing sanctity, as in this case, where the sanctity of the one-fifth is derived from its association with the sanctity of the house. |
| Leviticus 27:15 | the verse states: “And if he that consecrated it will redeem his house, | Temurah 10a:3 | <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> If one person consecrates his animal to be used as an offering by another, does the <b>one who consecrates</b> it <b>add one-fifth</b> when he redeems it, <b>or</b> does the <b>one atoning</b> by means of the offering <b>add one-fifth?</b> Who is considered the owner of the offering? <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And if he that consecrated it will redeem his house,</b> then he shall add the fifth part of the money” (Leviticus 27:15). It may be inferred from here that only the <b>one who consecrates</b> the item adds one-fifth, <b>but not</b> the <b>one for whom</b> the offering <b>atones.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:15 | Rav Pappa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi? The verse states: “And if he that consecrated it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part | Temurah 9b:12 | <b>Rav Pappa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi? The verse states: “And if he that consecrated it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part</b> of the money of your valuation unto it, and it shall be his” (Leviticus 27:15), from which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi infers that the requirement to pay an additional one-fifth applies to one <b>who consecrates</b> an item directly, <b>but not</b> to <b>the one who applies</b> the sanctity of another item to it. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | The verse states: | Arakhin 14a:10 | <b>The verse states:</b> “And if a man shall consecrate to the Lord part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to an area fit for sowing; the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty silver shekels” (Leviticus 27:16). The word <b>“field”</b> teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case,</b> regardless of the type of field. It can be inferred from here that if one consecrates an orchard, the redemption of the trees is not valued separately from the land. Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that he first <b>redeems</b> the trees <b>and afterward redeems</b> the field, according to the formula of the Torah. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | sowing a kor of barley | Arakhin 14a:5 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to an ancestral field that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent. How so? Both</b> one <b>who consecrates</b> an ancestral field <b>in</b> the low-quality <b>sands of the</b> areas <b>surrounding</b> the city <b>and</b> one <b>who consecrates</b> the high-quality <b>orchards of Sebastia gives</b> a redemption payment of <b>fifty silver shekels for</b> every area that he consecrated that is fit for <b>sowing a <i>kor</i> of barley</b> (Leviticus 27:16). <b>And with regard to a purchased field</b> that one consecrates, <b>he gives its value</b> as redemption, a sum that can be more or less than fifty shekels for every area required for sowing one <i>kor</i> of barley. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | “An area fit for sowing” | Arakhin 14a:9 | Rav Naḥman <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: When discussing a consecrated ancestral field the Torah states: <b>“An area fit for sowing”</b> (Leviticus 27:16). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only an area fit for sowing; from where</b> do I derive that the same is true for <b>a field of vines and a field of reeds and a field of trees?</b> |
| Leviticus 27:16 | sowing of a ḥomer of barley seed is redeemed for fifty silver shekels” | Arakhin 14b:13 | § The mishna teaches: And with regard to <b>a purchased field</b> that one consecrates, <b>he gives its value</b> as redemption, a sum that can be more or less than fifty silver shekels for an area required for the sowing of a <i>kor</i> of barley seed. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the <b>worth</b> of your valuation until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>What does this</b> word “worth” <b>come to teach? Since it is stated</b> with regard to an ancestral field: “An area fit for the <b>sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed is redeemed for fifty silver shekels”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a purchased field is also</b> redeemed using <b>this</b> formula. Therefore, <b>the verse states “worth,”</b> which means the market value of the field. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | But isn’t it taught | Arakhin 25a:10 | <b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna is referring to crevices that together take up only a small area, and <b>since they do not</b> measure <b>a <i>beit kor</i> they are not consecrated,</b> that cannot be correct: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man shall sanctify for the Lord part of his ancestral field” (Leviticus 27:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Field”? Since it is stated</b> in the same verse: “Your valuation shall be according to its sowing; <b>the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver,”</b> one might say: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> when <b>he consecrated</b> a field <b>like this,</b> i.e., one measuring at least a <i>beit kor</i>. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> fields that are fit for sowing only <b>a half<i>-kor</i> or half of a half-<i>kor</i>, a <i>se’a</i> or a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>vetarkav</i>], or</b> even <b>half of a half-<i>se’a</i>? The verse states: “Field,”</b> indicating that one may consecrate a field <b>in any case,</b> regardless of size. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | taught | Arakhin 25a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase: “The sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:16), is referring to an area required for sowing one <b><i>kor</i>,</b> thirty <i>se’a</i>, of barley <b>seed, and not</b> an area that yields one <b><i>kor</i></b> of barley <b>crop,</b> which is significantly smaller. This area is measured according to a field <b>sowed by hand and not sowed by oxen.</b> Since oxen sow the field by pulling a planter, which spreads the seeds at a higher density, the area containing one <i>kor</i> sown by oxen is smaller than the area of one <i>kor</i> sown by hand. <b>Levi taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The area is <b>not</b> measured according to the sowing of a particularly <b>dense</b> layer of seeds, <b>nor</b> a <b>sparse</b> layer, <b>but</b> rather in accordance with <b>an average</b> amount of seeds. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | a ḥomer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver” | Bava Batra103a:3 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it” (Leviticus 27:19): <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“field”?</b> Since the previous verses are all discussing a field, it would have sufficed for this verse to refer to the field with the pronoun: It. Rather, <b>as it is stated</b> in an earlier verse: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it; <b>a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | that they are not fit for sowing, | Bava Batra103a:5 | <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here,</b> in the mishna in <i>Arakhin</i>, <b>we are dealing with crevices filled with water.</b> Being <b>that they are not fit for sowing,</b> they cannot be consecrated, as the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it” (Leviticus 27:16). The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices that are <b>similar to rocks,</b> which are certainly not fit for sowing. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from this</b> that this explanation is correct. |
| Leviticus 27:16 | a field | Kiddushin 61a:3 | The verse states with regard to one who consecrates his field: “Part of <b>a field</b> of his possession” (Leviticus 27:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Since it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“The sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty</b> shekels of silver,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., consecrated an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this <i>halakha</i> <b>includes</b> a smaller area, e.g., one suitable for sowing <b>a half-<i>kor</i>, and half of a half-<i>kor</i>,</b> and the area for <b>a <i>se’a</i>,</b> and <b>a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is half a <i>se’a</i>, <b>and half a <i>tarkav</i>, and even</b> the area of <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i>? The <i>baraita</i> restates its question: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these areas of land can also be consecrated and redeemed based on the fixed values of the Torah? <b>The verse states “a field” in any case.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:17 | the verse states: “According to your valuation it shall stand” | Arakhin 18a:12 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we should compare valuations to assessments</b> in <b>that</b> the one pledging must <b>give</b> a person’s valuation not corresponding to his value at the time of the pledge but <b>in accordance with</b> his value at <b>the time of giving,</b> as is the case with regard to vows of assessments. To counter this suggestion <b>the verse states: “According to your valuation it shall stand”</b> (Leviticus 27:17), which teaches that the one making the valuation <b>gives</b> his donation <b>only</b> according to the valuation of the person <b>at the time of the valuation,</b> as stated in the mishna. |
| Leviticus 27:17 | from the Jubilee Year, | Arakhin 24b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav</b> that consecration of a field during the Jubilee Year is effective and that the field must be redeemed for the full price of fifty <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i>? <b>As the verse states: “If</b> he sanctifies his field <b>from the Jubilee Year,</b> according to your valuation it shall stand” (Leviticus 27:17). The verse indicates that a field is redeemed according to the valuation mentioned in the preceding verse, i.e., fifty <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i>, <b>and the Jubilee Year</b> itself <b>is included</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, as the verse describes a period that begins “from the Jubilee Year,” which can be understood as including the Jubilee Year itself. |
| Leviticus 27:18 | shall reckon | Arakhin 14b:14 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to purchased fields: “Then the priest <b>shall reckon</b> for him the worth of your valuation until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>And it is stated there,</b> with regard to an ancestral field: “But if he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, then the priest <b>shall reckon</b> for him the money according to the years that remain until the Jubilee Year, and it shall be deducted from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an ancestral field, it is referring to <b>a fixed amount, so too here,</b> with regard to a purchased field, it means <b>a fixed amount.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:18 | the Sages taught | Arakhin 25a:13 | § The mishna teaches that if <b>he consecrated</b> the field <b>two or three years</b> before the Jubilee Year and wishes to redeem it, he gives the Temple treasury a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i> per year. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the verse: “But if he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon for him the money according to the years that remain until the Jubilee Year, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18). |
| Leviticus 27:18 | year, that one does not listen to him? The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the money” | Arakhin 25a:15 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And if he said: I will give</b> the payment for each year during that year, one does not listen to him; rather, he must give the entire sum in one payment. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if the owner said: I will give</b> the payment <b>for each year during</b> that <b>year, that one does not listen to him? The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the money”</b> (Leviticus 27:18). The term “the money” indicates that the priest does not reckon the price for him <b>unless all of</b> the <b>money will be</b> paid together <b>as one</b> sum. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>both the owner and any</b> other <b>person. What</b> then <b>is</b> the difference <b>between</b> redemption by <b>the owner and</b> redemption by <b>any</b> other <b>person?</b> It is <b>that the owner gives</b> an extra <b>one-fifth</b> in addition to the payment, <b>and any</b> other <b>person does not give</b> the additional <b>one-fifth.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:18 | The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the money according to the years that remain | Arakhin 25a:3 | § The mishna teaches: <b>One does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid to the Temple treasury, but the Temple treasury may count months in order to raise the price of redemption. With regard to this statement, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid <b>to the Temple</b> treasury? <b>The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the money according to the years that remain</b> until the Jubilee Year, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18). This teaches that <b>you</b> are to <b>calculate years, but you</b> are <b>not</b> to <b>count months.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:18 | “And a deduction shall be made from your valuation” | Arakhin 25b:12 | Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: What is your reasoning?</b> Is it that since the verse states: <b>“And a deduction shall be made from your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:18), which indicates that the field is redeemed with a deduction according to the years remaining until the Jubilee Year, and the verse also states: <b>“But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee,</b> shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), this indicates <b>that</b> if the field <b>is fit for deduction,</b> then <b>yes,</b> when it is not redeemed by the owner it is given to the priests at the Jubilee Year, but with regard to a field <b>that is not fit for deduction,</b> i.e., one consecrated less than two years before the Jubilee Year, which must be redeemed according to its full valuation (24a), <b>no,</b> it is not given to the priests but rather is returned to the owner? |
| Leviticus 27:18 | from your valuation” | Shabbat 77b:1 | In the mishna at the end of the previous chapter we learned that the measure that determines liability for carrying out foods is calculated without their seeds [<i>garinin</i>]. Is the correct version <b><i>garinin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> <b>or <i>garinin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>? <b>Rava bar Ulla said:</b> It is with an <i>ayin</i>, since it stems from the same root as: <b>“And it shall be subtracted [<i>venigra</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>] <b>from your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:18). |
| Leviticus 27:19 | will indeed redeem it” | Arakhin 30b:21 | § The mishna teaches: <b>But with regard to</b> redeeming a field from <b>the Temple</b> treasury, it is permitted to redeem the field in any of these ways. This is a <i>halakha</i> where greater stringency applies with regard to redeeming a field from an ordinary individual than with regard to redeeming it from the Temple treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse dealing with one who consecrates his field: <b>“And if</b> the one who consecrates the field <b>will indeed redeem it”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). The phrase “will indeed redeem” <b>teaches that</b> one <b>may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> his field, <b>and</b> one <b>may partially redeem</b> his field, despite the fact that one may not do so when redeeming a field from an ordinary individual. |
| Leviticus 27:19 | But isn’t it taught | Bava Batra103a:3 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it” (Leviticus 27:19): <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“field”?</b> Since the previous verses are all discussing a field, it would have sufficed for this verse to refer to the field with the pronoun: It. Rather, <b>as it is stated</b> in an earlier verse: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it; <b>a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed. |
| Leviticus 27:19 | “And he will give the money and it will be assured to him” | Bava Metzia54a:15 | § <b>Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property <b>cannot be desacralized with land, as the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the redemption of a consecrated field: <b>“And he will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19), indicating that redemption is accomplished with money. The question is with regard to payment of <b>its</b> additional <b>one-fifth: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in terms of the possibility <b>that it will be desacralized with land?</b> |
| Leviticus 27:19 | for land instead of money, and the Torah states: “He will give the money and it will be assured to him” | Berakhot 47b:10 | We also learned in the mishna that if one ate <b>second tithe</b> and consecrated food that had not been redeemed, he may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara remarks: <b>It is obvious?</b> Why was it necessary for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>It was only necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they were redeemed, but not redeemed properly, i.e., second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>],</b> a silver bullion that had not been engraved. <b>And the Torah says: “And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), which the Sages interpreted as follows: <i>Vetzarta</i> refers to <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it. Consecrated property;</b> in a case <b>where he redeemed it</b> by exchanging it <b>for land instead of money, and the Torah states: “He will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). |
| Leviticus 27:19 | “And if he will redeem [ ga’ol yigal ] | Kiddushin 20b:15 | Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: From Rabbi Shimon’s interpretation one learns that</b> with regard to houses in walled cities, <b>one can borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> them, <b>and</b> similarly that one <b>can partially redeem</b> them. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that describes one who consecrates his field: <b>“And if he will redeem [<i>ga’ol yigal</i>]</b> the field” (Leviticus 27:19). The repetition of the verb <b>teaches that one can borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> houses in walled cities <b>and</b> that <b>one can</b> also <b>partially redeem</b> them. |
| Leviticus 27:19 | “And if he will redeem [ ga’ol yigal ] | Kiddushin 20b:19 | Rava bar Ḥinnana <b>raised an objection to</b> this opinion from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states with regard to one who consecrates his field: <b>“And if he will redeem [<i>ga’ol yigal</i>]</b> the field” (Leviticus 27:19). This <b>teaches that he may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> it, <b>and partially redeem</b> it. |
| Leviticus 27:19 | He will give the money “and it will be assured to him” | Shabbat 128a:3 | We learned in the mishna: <b>Nor</b> may one move <b>second tithe</b> and consecrated items that were not redeemed. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious. It was only necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they were redeemed but not redeemed properly.</b> When the mishna lists the <b>second tithe,</b> it is referring to <b>that which was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>],</b> i.e., a silver bullion that had not been engraved. <b>And God,</b> in the Torah, <b>states</b> in the case of second tithe: <b>“And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). The Sages interpreted this as follows: <i>Vetzarta</i> is <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it.</b> When the mishna lists <b>consecrated property,</b> it is referring to <b>that which was redeemed</b> by exchanging it <b>for land instead of money. And God,</b> in the Torah, <b>states</b> with regard to this: <b>He will give the money “and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). Money and not land may be used in redeeming consecrated property. |
| Leviticus 27:20 | it shall not be redeemed” | Arakhin 26b:2 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from the following <i>baraita</i>: Since the verse states: “And if he will not redeem the field, or if he sold the field to another man, <b>it shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:20), one <b>might</b> have thought that this means <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> at all by its owner, even <b>for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anymore,”</b> indicating that <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> in order for it <b>to</b> return to <b>the way it was,</b> i.e., an ancestral field, <b>but it</b> may be <b>redeemed for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:21 | the Merciful One states: “But the field, | Arakhin 14b:9 | Rav Pappa further says: If one <b>consecrated trees</b> in his ancestral field, <b>he redeems</b> them according <b>to their value. What is the reason? The Merciful One states</b> that one redeems <b>an area</b> fit <b>for sowing</b> of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed for fifty silver shekels. This is referring specifically to land fit for sowing grain, <b>and not trees.</b> Furthermore, if <b>he did not redeem</b> the trees, they <b>do not go to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year, unlike an ancestral field. The reason is that <b>the Merciful One states: “But the field,</b> when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the Lord, as a field devoted; it shall belong to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). This too is referring specifically to a field, <b>and not trees.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:21 | “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, | Arakhin 25b:12 | Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: What is your reasoning?</b> Is it that since the verse states: <b>“And a deduction shall be made from your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:18), which indicates that the field is redeemed with a deduction according to the years remaining until the Jubilee Year, and the verse also states: <b>“But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee,</b> shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), this indicates <b>that</b> if the field <b>is fit for deduction,</b> then <b>yes,</b> when it is not redeemed by the owner it is given to the priests at the Jubilee Year, but with regard to a field <b>that is not fit for deduction,</b> i.e., one consecrated less than two years before the Jubilee Year, which must be redeemed according to its full valuation (24a), <b>no,</b> it is not given to the priests but rather is returned to the owner? |
| Leviticus 27:21 | his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” | Arakhin 25b:14 | § The mishna teaches: If <b>one of the priests redeemed</b> the field and when the Jubilee Year arrived it was in his possession, he may not say: Since it is removed from the possession of the one who redeemed it and given to the priests during the Jubilee Year, and since it is already in my possession, it is mine. Rather, the field is removed from his possession and is divided among all of his brethren, the priests. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord…<b>his ancestral possession shall be for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21)? |
| Leviticus 27:21 | so too here, | Arakhin 25b:20 | The Gemara explains: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to one who consecrates a house, where the verse states: “And when a man shall consecrate his house to be holy for the Lord” (Leviticus 27:14), it can be redeemed from the Temple treasury only <b>by</b> payment of <b>money,</b> as the verse concludes: “As the priest shall value it, so shall it stand,” <b>so too here,</b> where the verse states with regard to the priests entering into an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), the priests can enter the field only <b>by</b> payment of <b>money.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:21 | verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, | Arakhin 26a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it?</b> In other words, now that both suggestions have been rejected, what is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that a consecrated ancestral field that has not been redeemed by the Jubilee Year is not given to the priests? <b>Rava said</b> that the <b>verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee,</b> shall be holy for the Lord, as a dedicated field; his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). The term “when it goes out” indicates that it is given to the priests only <b>when it goes out</b> during the Jubilee Year <b>from the possession of another</b> person, who redeemed it from the Temple treasury. |
| Leviticus 27:21 | as it is stated: “As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest” | Arakhin 28b:1 | <b>shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:14), i.e., for Aaron and any of his descendants. But if one <b>dedicated his fields, he gives them to a priest of that</b> priestly <b>watch</b> which is currently serving in the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21). <b>And one derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“to the priest”</b> here and <b>“to the priest” from</b> a verse (Numbers 5:8) discussing property <b>robbed</b> from <b>a convert.</b> The <i>halakha</i> in that case is that if one took an oath that he did not rob a convert, and then after the convert died and left no descendants he admitted to taking a false oath, he must give the stolen property to the priests of the priestly watch currently serving in the Temple. |
| Leviticus 27:21 | “As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest” | Arakhin 28b:11 | <b>And the Rabbis say: Dedications</b> dedicated <b>without specification</b> of their purpose are designated <b>for priests, as it is stated</b> with regard to one who consecrated a field and did not redeem it: <b>“As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21), indicating that a non-specific dedication belongs to the priest. <b>If so, why is it stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord”?</b> This comes to teach <b>that</b> dedication <b>takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> If one consecrated an animal for sacrifice and then dedicated it, the dedication takes effect. Nevertheless, it does not take effect on the body of the animal; rather, it applies to the owner’s financial stake in the offering. |
| Leviticus 27:21 | is observed, as it is stated: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be sacred to the Lord, as a field dedicated; | Arakhin 29a:17 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a dedicated field apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be sacred to the Lord, as a field dedicated;</b> its possession shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>] apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:21 | When the verse specified with regard to an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, | Arakhin 33a:18 | <b>When the verse specified with regard to an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord,</b> as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), one derives that <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a field that</b> one can <b>redeem it and</b> yet <b>it leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury to enter the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>these</b> houses in unwalled courtyards that were consecrated and redeemed by another, <b>they remain in their current state,</b> i.e., in the possession of the one who redeemed them. |
| Leviticus 27:21 | since it is stated: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, | Arakhin 33b:17 | Furthermore, <b>since it is stated: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord,</b> as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who consecrated his field. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> which teaches that the field of a Levite is not transferred to the possession of the priests in the Jubilee Year; rather, the Levite may always redeem it from the Temple treasury. |
| Leviticus 27:21 | as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest” | Arakhin 34a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states, with regard to one who consecrated his ancestral field but failed to redeem it before the Jubilee Year: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, <b>as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “As a field dedicated”? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a priest who consecrated his dedicated field,</b> i.e., a field that was dedicated to the priests by an Israelite, and the Jubilee Year arrived, <b>that he may not say: Since</b> a field that was consecrated by its owners and was not redeemed <b>leaves to</b> the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year, <b>and this</b> field that I consecrated <b>is</b> already <b>in my possession, it is</b> therefore <b>mine.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:21 | “to the priest [ lakohen ]” | Bava Kamma109b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> states its ruling specifically <b>with regard to an impure priest,</b> how can it describe the payment as <b>a matter in which</b> the priest <b>has a portion? Does he have</b> a portion in it? Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> must not be referring to an impure priest. <b>Rather,</b> there is another reason why he has no right to the payment. This <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the phrase <b>“even the priest’s [<i>lakohen</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:8) written in this context, and the phrase <b>“to the priest [<i>lakohen</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 27:21) <b>from</b> the verse stated concerning <b>an ancestral field,</b> which, if consecrated and then redeemed by another does not revert to its original owner in the Jubilee Year, but is given to the priests, as the <i>baraita</i> will now explain. |
| Leviticus 27:21 | As it is taught | Bava Kamma109b:12 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the term: <b>“The possession thereof”? From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> with regard to <b>a field that goes out to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and one of the priests redeemed it</b> before the Jubilee Year, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a priest <b>shall not say: Since</b> a field that is redeemed by another <b>goes out to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> the field that I redeemed <b>is</b> now <b>in my possession, it should be mine,</b> and not be given to the priests in general? |
| Leviticus 27:21 | The verse states: “As a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest” | Bava Kamma109b:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct. <b>The verse states: “As a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21), indicating that a field of which the priest has <b>possession</b> from his ancestors <b>is his, but this</b> field that he redeemed <b>is not his. How so?</b> It <b>is removed from his possession and is distributed to all of his brethren, the priests.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:21 | “As a field dedicated; to the priest shall be its possession” | Sanhedrin 88a:5 | <b>And the Rabbis say: Dedications</b> dedicated <b>without specification</b> of their purpose are designated <b>for the priest, as it is stated</b> with regard to one who consecrated a field and did not redeem it: <b>“As a field dedicated; to the priest shall be its possession”</b> (Leviticus 27:21). <b>If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Every dedicated item is most sacred unto the Lord”?</b> It is to teach <b>that</b> dedication <b>takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> According to the Rabbis, the property is not consecrated, and if a woman is betrothed with that property, the betrothal takes effect, and one who engages in intercourse with her is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. According to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, the property is consecrated and he is not liable. |
| Leviticus 27:22 | a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields” | Arakhin 14a:18 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who purchases a field from his father and consecrated it, and afterward his father dies,</b> which means that the field would now be his as an inheritance, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that it should be</b> considered <b>before him as an ancestral field,</b> rather than a field that he purchased, with respect to its redemption? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a field that was purchased: <b>“And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields”</b> (Leviticus 27:22). |
| Leviticus 27:22 | a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field” | Arakhin 14b:1 | <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a purchased field: “And <b>if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22). The verse is referring specifically to <b>a field that is not an ancestral field</b> at the time of its consecration. This requirement <b>excludes this</b> field, <b>as</b> currently, after the death of the father, <b>it is an ancestral field.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:22 | a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field” | Arakhin 26b:15 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> Even in a case where the son consecrated the field before his father died, <b>its</b> halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>an ancestral field, as it is stated</b> with regard to a purchased field: “And <b>if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> field, <b>which</b> at the time of consecration <b>is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field</b> in the future, when his father dies. |
| Leviticus 27:22 | a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field” | Arakhin 26b:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who purchases</b> an ancestral <b>field from his father and consecrated it, and afterward his father died, from where</b> is it derived <b>that it shall be</b> treated <b>for him like an ancestral field? The verse states: “And if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> field that he purchased from his father, <b>which</b> at the time of consecration <b>is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:22 | of his ancestral field” | Arakhin 27a:1 | <b>But here,</b> with regard to their opinion that even if the son consecrated the field before his father’s death it is considered an ancestral field, this is because they <b>found</b> another allusion in the <b>verse and interpreted</b> it as follows: If the verse meant to indicate only the <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Meir derives from it, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> And <b>if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral field, or: Which is not an ancestral field. What</b> is the meaning of the extra word “of” in the phrase: “Which is not <b>of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22)? It teaches that only <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field</b> is treated like a purchased field, thereby <b>excluding this</b> field, <b>which is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:22 | a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields” | Bava Batra72b:5 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>with regard to one who purchases a field from his father and consecrates it, and afterward his father dies,</b> so the field would now be considered his as an inheritance, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> with regard to its redemption <b>it should be</b> considered <b>before him as an ancestral field</b> and not a field that he purchased? <b>The verse states</b> about a field that was purchased: <b>“And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields”</b> (Leviticus 27:22). The verse speaks specifically of <b>a field that is not fit</b> at the time of its consecration <b>to be an ancestral field,</b> meaning that he never could have inherited it in the future. This specification <b>excludes this</b> field <b>that was fit to be an ancestral field</b> from this <i>halakha</i>, since eventually it would have become his through inheritance, even had he not purchased it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:22 | “Which is not of his ancestral fields” | Bava Batra72b:9 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: Actually,</b> I can say to you that <b>generally</b> speaking, <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon do not follow</b> the time of the <b>redemption,</b> and therefore their ruling here is not based on this premise. <b>But here they found a verse and interpreted it,</b> as, if the verse is to be understood as it was explained by Rabbi Meir, then <b>let the verse write: And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral estate, or</b> let it write: Which is not <b>his ancestral field. What</b> is meant by the expression: <b>“Which is not of his ancestral fields”</b> (Leviticus 27:22)? It means that <b>a field that is not fit to</b> ever <b>be an ancestral field</b> is considered a purchased field. That <b>excludes this</b> field, <b>as it is fit to be an ancestral field.</b> Based on this explanation, the <i>baraita</i> that addresses one who consecrates trees can, in fact, be understood to be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. |
| Leviticus 27:22 | “Of his ancestral field” | Gittin 48a:13 | The Gemara rejects this explanation of the dispute. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>in general Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that the <b>acquisition of</b> an item for <b>its produce is considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>acquisition of the item itself,</b> and they agree that the verse is necessary to teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning a case where he consecrated the field after his father’s death. <b>And here, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon found</b> another element of the <b>verse and</b> they <b>expounded</b> it. They maintain that if the verse is teaching the <i>halakha</i> only in the case where he consecrated the field after his father’s death, then <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: And <b>if</b> he sanctify to the Lord <b>a field which he has bought, which is not his ancestral field. What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“Of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22)? This emphasizes: <b>A field that is not fit to be an ancestral field,</b> meaning that he would not inherit it in the future. <b>This</b> field, which the son was entitled to inherit after he had consecrated it, <b>is excluded, as it is fit to be an ancestral field,</b> although the son had purchased it. |
| Leviticus 27:22 | a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his ancestral field” | Gittin 48a:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states:</b> “And <b>if</b> he sanctify to the Lord <b>a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22). The addition of the phrase: “Which is not of the field of his ancestral field,” teaches that the <i>halakha</i> that the field reverts to the original owner applies specifically to <b>a field that is not fit to be an ancestral field,</b> meaning that he would not inherit it in the future. <b>This</b> field, which the son was entitled to inherit after he had consecrated it, <b>is excluded, as it is fit to be an ancestral field,</b> although the son had purchased it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:23 | worth | Arakhin 14b:13 | § The mishna teaches: And with regard to <b>a purchased field</b> that one consecrates, <b>he gives its value</b> as redemption, a sum that can be more or less than fifty silver shekels for an area required for the sowing of a <i>kor</i> of barley seed. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the <b>worth</b> of your valuation until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>What does this</b> word “worth” <b>come to teach? Since it is stated</b> with regard to an ancestral field: “An area fit for the <b>sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed is redeemed for fifty silver shekels”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a purchased field is also</b> redeemed using <b>this</b> formula. Therefore, <b>the verse states “worth,”</b> which means the market value of the field. |
| Leviticus 27:23 | shall reckon | Arakhin 14b:14 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to purchased fields: “Then the priest <b>shall reckon</b> for him the worth of your valuation until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>And it is stated there,</b> with regard to an ancestral field: “But if he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, then the priest <b>shall reckon</b> for him the money according to the years that remain until the Jubilee Year, and it shall be deducted from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an ancestral field, it is referring to <b>a fixed amount, so too here,</b> with regard to a purchased field, it means <b>a fixed amount.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:23 | the worth of your valuation | Arakhin 14b:18 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling <b>of Rava, but not for his reason. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Then the priest shall reckon for him <b>the worth of your valuation</b> until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> this estimation <b>to</b> fixed <b>valuations. Just as</b> with regard to fixed <b>valuations</b> one does <b>not add one-fifth, so too</b> when redeeming <b>a purchased field</b> one does <b>not add one-fifth.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:23 | “And he shall give your valuation as of that day” | Arakhin 24a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that the Temple treasury has the right to collect the item based only on its current location and its present time, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, with regard to the redemption of a consecrated item: <b>“And he shall give your valuation as of that day”</b> (Leviticus 27:23). The phrase “as of that day” indicates <b>that he should not delay</b> the sale of <b>a pearl for the light</b> ones, i.e., for poor people, in order that they should take it to the city to sell it. Rather, it is appraised according to its present location. The verse continues: <b>“As a holy thing unto the Lord,”</b> which teaches that <b>unspecified</b> vows of <b>consecration,</b> e.g., when one states: My property is consecrated, are given <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> rather than to the priests. |
| Leviticus 27:23 | and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a consecrated thing to the Lord” | Chullin 139a:21 | <b>Rava objects to this: Let him say: I am</b> encumbered <b>with my own valuation,</b> or: <b>I am</b> encumbered <b>with the valuation of so-and-so.</b> One need not say: Is incumbent upon me. <b>Additionally, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the redemption of a purchased field that was consecrated that <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> about the verse: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the worth of your valuation until the Jubilee Year, <b>and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a consecrated thing to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:23): <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “And he shall give your valuation”? It could have stated simply: And he shall give it. It is necessary <b>because we have found with regard to consecrated</b> property <b>and tithes that they can be desacralized</b> by transferring their sanctity <b>onto non-sacred money,</b> and that if that money <b>was stolen or lost,</b> the owners <b>do not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for it.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:23 | “giving” from valuations | Kiddushin 17a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The master gives him <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>like the fifty</b> shekels <b>of valuations</b> for an adult male. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? He derived</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“giving”</b> and <b>“giving” from valuations</b> (Leviticus 27:23): <b>Just as there,</b> he pays <b>fifty, so too here,</b> he pays <b>fifty.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that as this verbal analogy is referring to valuations in general, he should pay <b>the smallest of the valuations,</b> which is merely three <i>sela</i>. The Gemara answers that <b>it is written: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), which indicates that one must give a respectable amount as a severance gift. |
| Leviticus 27:24 | “In the Jubilee Year the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought” | Arakhin 26a:10 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who consecrated a purchased field and redeemed it, since the verse states: <b>“In the Jubilee Year the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought”</b> (Leviticus 27:24), one <b>might</b> have thought that the field <b>shall return to the</b> Temple <b>treasurer, from whom he bought it</b> when he redeemed it. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> immediately afterward: <b>“To the one to whom the possession of the land belongs,”</b> i.e., it goes to the ancestral owner who initially sold the field to the one who consecrated it. |
| Leviticus 27:24 | the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought” | Arakhin 26b:6 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who consecrated a purchased field and redeemed it, since the verse states: “In the Jubilee Year <b>the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought”</b> (Leviticus 27:24), one <b>might</b> have thought that the field <b>shall return to the</b> Temple <b>treasurer, from whom he bought it</b> when he redeemed it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the one to whom the possession of the land belongs,”</b> i.e., the ancestral owner. |
| Leviticus 27:25 | since it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary” | Arakhin 4a:11 | The Gemara explains the relevance of ben Bukhri’s opinion to the question of the priests’ status with respect to valuations. According to ben Bukhri, who exempts the priests from contributing the half-shekel, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25), perhaps this juxtaposition teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation to contribute half-<b>shekels is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations. But</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are not</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation to contribute half-<b>shekels, they are</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even according to the opinion of ben Bukhri, priests are included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. |
| Leviticus 27:25 | “And all your valuations | Arakhin 4a:12 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: One could not have thought that <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“And all your valuations</b> shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:25), might be coming to exempt the priests, as <b>it comes to</b> teach something else, namely that <b>all valuations that you assess should not be less than</b> the value of <b>a <i>sela</i></b> coin. In other words, a poor person, who gives according to his means rather than the amount prescribed in the Torah, does not fulfill his obligation unless he gives at least a shekel, which is a <i>sela</i> coin. |
| Leviticus 27:25 | shekel, as it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary” | Arakhin 4b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that smallest of the valuations is one <b>shekel, as it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to affordability.</b> If one vows to donate the valuation of a person to the Temple treasury but does not have sufficient funds to fulfill his vow, he must pay at least a shekel. |
| Leviticus 27:25 | As it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary” | Arakhin 7b:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>One cannot be charged for a valuation less than a <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this principle? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25). This verse indicates that <b>all valuations that you valuate shall not be less than a shekel,</b> which is the equivalent of a <i>sela</i>. One does not fulfill his obligation by giving less than this amount. |
| Leviticus 27:25 | shekel | Arakhin 7b:19 | § The mishna teaches that if <b>there were five <i>sela</i> in</b> the <b>possession</b> of the destitute person, Rabbi Meir says: He gives only one <i>sela</i> and thereby fulfills his obligation, and the Rabbis say: He gives all five. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> with regard to a male between the ages of twenty and sixty: “Your valuation shall be <b>fifty</b> shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:3), and the verses likewise specify the valuations for other individuals. <b>And it is</b> also <b>written:</b> “Your valuations shall be according to the <b>shekel</b> of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:25). This teaches that the valuation is <b>either fifty</b> shekels for one who vows to donate the valuation of a man between twenty and sixty, <b>or</b> one <b>shekel,</b> if he cannot afford to pay fifty. |
| Leviticus 27:25 | “And all your valuations shall be with the shekel of the Sanctuary” | Bekhorot 10b:32 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the verse <b>does not compare</b> them, and the reason a lamb worth a shekel is required is due to that which <b>Rava says: The verse states</b> with regard to redemption of consecrated property: <b>“And all your valuations shall be with the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25), which indicates that <b>all valuations that you assess should not be less than</b> the value of <b>a shekel.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:25 | the shekel” | Bekhorot 50a:6 | The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the period <b>after</b> the Sages <b>added</b> one-sixth <b>to</b> the coins, i.e., four <i>ma’a</i> to each <i>sela</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: <b>“Twenty <i>gera</i></b> shall be <b>the shekel”</b> (Leviticus 27:25): <b>We learn</b> from here <b>with regard to the shekel</b> mentioned in the Torah <b>that it is twenty <i>gera</i>. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one wants to add</b> to the number of <i>ma’a</i> in the shekel <b>he may add? The verse states:</b> “Twenty <i>gera</i> <b>shall be</b> the shekel,” whereby the term “shall be” denotes an increase. One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>may reduce</b> the number of <i>ma’a</i> in the shekel to fewer than twenty. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The same</b> is twenty <i>gera</i>” (Numbers 18:16), i.e., it may not be fewer than that. |
| Leviticus 27:26 | shall not consecrate | Arakhin 29a:20 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One verse states:</b> “All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock <b>you shall consecrate</b> to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19), <b>and one verse states:</b> “However, the firstborn among animals that is born first to the Lord, a man <b>shall not consecrate</b> it” (Leviticus 27:26). It is <b>impossible to say: “You shall consecrate,” as it is already stated:</b> “A man <b>shall not consecrate.”</b> It is likewise <b>impossible to say:</b> “A man <b>shall not consecrate,” as it is already stated: “You shall consecrate.”</b> |
| Leviticus 27:26 | to firstborn | Bava Kamma78a:5 | <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to firstborn</b> animals, concerning which it is written: “However, the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or <i>seh</i>, it is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 27:26), it is not necessary in that context either. The reason is that this can be <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>passing,</b> in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to the Lord all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term <b>passing, from</b> a verse concerning <b>animal tithe:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here. |
| Leviticus 27:26 | with regard to a firstborn. Just as one cannot dedicate a firstborn as any offering he desires, as it is written: “But the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstborn to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it” | Bekhorot 15b:8 | <b>Ravina raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> According to Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the following matter: <b>Can one dedicate</b> the unborn offspring <b>as any offering he desires?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: He may not dedicate them</b> as any offering other than that for which the mother was consecrated. Ravina asked: <b>What is the reason?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the phrase: <b>“Within</b> all <b>your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:15), and: <b>“Within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22), written <b>with regard to a firstborn. Just as one cannot dedicate a firstborn as any offering he desires, as it is written: “But the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstborn to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it”</b> (Leviticus 27:26), <b>so too, one cannot dedicate these</b> offspring <b>as any offering he desires.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:26 | are sanctified in the womb of their mother. As the Sages taught | Temurah 25a:2 | <b>And this <i>tanna</i></b> disagrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and <b>holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are sanctified in the womb of their mother. As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to a firstborn: “But the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, man shall not consecrate it” (Leviticus 27:26). <b>If</b> that verse were <b>not</b> complete but merely <b>stated: The firstborn shall not consecrate, I would have said</b> that the verse is teaching that <b>a firstborn</b> man <b>shall not consecrate</b> non-sacred <b>items.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Man</b> shall not consecrate <b>it,”</b> i.e., <b>you may not consecrate it,</b> a firstborn animal, <b>but a firstborn man may consecrate</b> non-sacred <b>items.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:26 | “Whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s” | Temurah 5b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Abaye, from where does he</b> derive <b>this conclusion</b> that the substitutes are not sacrificed? The Gemara answers: The verse states concerning firstborn offerings: <b>“Whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 27:26). One can infer from this wording that it <b>is sacrificed to the Lord but its substitute is not sacrificed.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:26 | “Whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s” | Zevachim 81b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, i.e., the <i>tanna</i> who derives the <i>halakha</i> that the blood of offerings that ascend to the altar do not nullify one another from the verse: “They are holy” (Numbers 18:17), from where does he learn that the substitute of a firstborn is not sacrificed? The Gemara explains: He <b>derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“Whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 27:26). The emphasis of “it is” teaches that <b>it is sacrificed but its substitute is not sacrificed.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:27 | unto it | Bava Metzia54a:18 | Rami bar Ḥama was unable to resolve this series of dilemmas, and <b>the matter proceeded and came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to</b> the people who related the dilemmas to him: <b>The verse states:</b> “And shall add <b>unto it</b> one-fifth part thereof” (Leviticus 27:27), which serves <b>to include its</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> within the same legal status <b>as</b> that of <b>its</b> principal. |
| Leviticus 27:27 | “And shall add unto it one-fifth part thereof” | Bava Metzia54a:3 | The Gemara comments: The two sides of this dilemma are <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And shall add unto it one-fifth part thereof”</b> (Leviticus 27:27). This means <b>that</b> the item <b>and its</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>will</b> total <b>five</b> parts; one-fifth is calculated from without; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. Rabbi Yonatan says: Its one-fifth</b> means <b>one-fifth of the principal;</b> one-fifth is calculated from within. |
| Leviticus 27:27 | “And if it is of a non-kosher animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation” | Bava Metzia54b:9 | The Gemara relates that <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Elazar.</b> It is written: <b>“And if it is of a non-kosher animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:27). This verse teaches that <b>just as a non-kosher animal</b> that was consecrated <b>is unique</b> in <b>that it is</b> an example of <b>initial consecration and it is</b> devoted <b>entirely to Heaven,</b> as neither the owner nor anyone else may derive benefit from it after its consecration, <b>and one</b> violates the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>by</b> using <b>it</b> after it was consecrated, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> item that both undergoes <b>initial consecration and is</b> devoted <b>entirely to Heaven, one</b> violates the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>by</b> using <b>it</b> after it was consecrated. |
| Leviticus 27:27 | and if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold according to your valuation” | Bekhorot 13a:7 | With regard to a non-kosher animal that was consecrated to the Temple, <b>the mitzva of redemption by the owner</b> who consecrated it <b>takes precedence over</b> redemption by <b>any</b> other <b>person, as it is stated:</b> “And if it is of a non-kosher animal…<b>and if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:27). |
| Leviticus 27:27 | states: “And if it be of an impure animal” | Bekhorot 37b:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say that the verse is speaking of</b> animals with <b>blemishes that were redeemed, or</b> is it referring <b>only</b> to <b>an actual impure animal,</b> such as a donkey or a horse that was consecrated; but with regard to a kosher animal, perhaps its consecrated status cannot be removed by redemption even if it was blemished? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And if it be of an impure animal”</b> (Leviticus 27:27), <b>a non-kosher animal is mentioned. So how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“Of which they may not bring an offering”? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed,</b> indicating that redemption is permitted. |
| Leviticus 27:27 | “And if it be of an impure [ tamei ] animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation, | Menachot 101a:3 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse is referring <b>to blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed, or is it</b> referring <b>only to an actual non-kosher [<i>tamei</i>] animal,</b> as the plain sense of the verse indicates? The Gemara responds: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> later in that section: <b>“And if it be of an impure [<i>tamei</i>] animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation,</b> and shall add to it the fifth part thereof” (Leviticus 27:27), an actual <b>non-kosher animal is mentioned</b> as being subject to redemption. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And if it be any impure [<i>tamei</i>] animal”</b> (Leviticus 27:11)? <b>The verse is speaking of blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed,</b> i.e., that have the possibility of being redeemed. |
| Leviticus 27:27 | if it be of a non-kosher animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation” | Temurah 32b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse is <b>speaking of blemished animals; or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> referring <b>only to a non-kosher animal,</b> and it is teaching that a non-kosher animal that was consecrated for Temple maintenance is redeemed through standing and valuation. The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>When it says</b> later in that passage: “And <b>if it be of a non-kosher animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:27), <b>a non-kosher animal</b> is thereby <b>stated</b> as subject to redemption. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | or of his ancestral field” | Arakhin 28a:14 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> what is his reasoning? <b>Granted, priests may not dedicate</b> property, <b>as dedicated</b> property <b>is theirs;</b> it is one of the gifts of the priesthood. <b>But</b> why are <b>Levites</b> unable to dedicate their property? <b>Granted,</b> they may <b>not dedicate land, as it is written: “As that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34). <b>But let them dedicate movable property.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing, that a man may dedicate to the Lord <b>of all that he has,</b> whether of man or animal, <b>or of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the dedication of <b>movable property to</b> that of <b>land.</b> Accordingly, as Levites cannot dedicate land, they cannot dedicate movable property either. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | as the Sages taught | Arakhin 28a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> stated in the mishna, derived? The Gemara explains that this is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing that a man may dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of his ancestral field” (Leviticus 27:28). The verse indicates that one may dedicate <b>“of all that he has” but not all that he has;</b> likewise <b>“of man” but not every man,</b> i.e., not every slave of his; “of man <b>or animal” but not every animal</b> of his; and finally one may dedicate <b>“of</b> his <b>ancestral field” but not all of</b> his <b>ancestral field.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:28 | for Temple maintenance, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” | Arakhin 28b:10 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Dedications</b> of property for <b>priests,</b> unlike consecrations of property for Temple maintenance, <b>have no redemption; rather, one gives</b> it <b>to the priests,</b> and it is their property in every sense, <b>like <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: Dedications</b> dedicated <b>without specification</b> of their purpose are designated <b>for Temple maintenance, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). |
| Leviticus 27:28 | before Rabbi Abbahu: But let one juxtapose movable property to land, | Arakhin 28b:8 | The Gemara returns to the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin that one who dedicates his movable property may give it to a priest of his choosing, whereas one who dedicates his land gives it to members of the current priestly watch. The Gemara relates that <b>Ḥizkiyya bar Biluto heard this</b> statement <b>and went</b> and <b>said</b> the following difficulty <b>before Rabbi Abbahu: But let one juxtapose movable property to land,</b> as the verse states: “That a man may dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of his ancestral field” (Leviticus 27:28). If so, movable property must also be given to members of the current priestly watch. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | in every sense, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” | Arakhin 29a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Dedications</b> of property for <b>priests have no redemption, and one gives</b> the property <b>to the priest.</b> With regard to these <b>dedications, as long as they</b> remain <b>in the house of the owner they are</b> considered <b>like consecrated</b> property <b>in every sense, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). Once the owner <b>has given them to the priest they are in every sense like non-sacred</b> property, <b>as it is stated: “Everything dedicated in Israel shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:14), i.e., it shall be like all other regular property belonging to a priest, which is non-sacred. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | for Temple maintenance, | Arakhin 29a:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says dedications</b> donated <b>without specification</b> are designated <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28). And the Rabbis say they are designated for priests, as it is stated: “As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), whereas the verse cited by Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira teaches that dedication takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> is clear, <b>as they explain their reason and the reason of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira,</b> i.e., they interpret the verse he cited as his proof. <b>But</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, this</b> verse: <b>“As a field dedicated;</b> its possession shall be to the priest,” <b>what does he do with it,</b> i.e., what does he derive from it? |
| Leviticus 27:28 | And the Rabbis, | Arakhin 29a:22 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who derive the <i>halakha</i> that a dedication takes effect on all offerings of sanctity from the verse: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28), would explain that the verse “A man <b>shall not consecrate” is necessary to</b> teach that there is a Torah <b>prohibition</b> against consecrating a firstborn animal for the sake of another offering. As for the other verse discussed in the mishna: <b>“You shall consecrate,”</b> it <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a firstborn</b> animal that <b>was born in</b> one’s <b>flock that</b> it is <b>a mitzva to consecrate it</b> verbally as a firstborn? <b>As it is stated: “The</b> firstborn <b>males</b> that are born of your herd and of your flock <b>you shall consecrate.”</b> |
| Leviticus 27:28 | takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity, | Arakhin 29a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, from where does he</b> derive <b>that</b> a dedication <b>takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> which, according to the Rabbis, is learned from the verse: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28)? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who derives this <i>halakha</i> from another source, as explained in the mishna below. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | nor shall be redeemed” | Bava Metzia47a:14 | The Gemara comments: This dispute between Rav and Levi is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The verse states: <b>“Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redemption and concerning substitution, to confirm all matters; a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor”</b> (Ruth 4:7). The verse is interpreted: <b>“Redemption”; that is a sale. And likewise it says:</b> “Neither shall be sold <b>nor shall be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). <b>“Substitution”; that is</b> the transaction of <b>exchange. And likewise it says: “He may neither exchange it nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). |
| Leviticus 27:28 | “it” | Bekhorot 32a:23 | The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One limits</b> the extension of the prohibition against selling <b>with regard to dedications</b> by adding the term <b>“it”</b> in the verse: “It is most holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28). The term <b>“it”</b> teaches that the prohibition against selling applies only to it, i.e., dedications, <b>but not</b> to <b>a firstborn</b> offering. The Gemara raises a difficulty: But one can <b>say</b> instead that the term <b>“it”</b> teaches that the prohibition against selling applies to dedications, <b>but not</b> to the animal <b>tithe</b> offering. The Gemara answers: The prohibition against selling applies to the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, with regard to which the expression of <b>redemption</b> is written, <b>just like</b> dedications, while the term “it” limits the prohibition to the firstborn offering. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | in all respects, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most holy to the Lord” | Bekhorot 32a:25 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Dedications, as long as they are in the owner’s possession, are like consecrated</b> property <b>in all respects, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). Once the owner <b>gave them to the priest, they are like non-sacred property in all respects, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item in Israel shall be for You”</b> (Numbers 18:14). Rava continues: Accordingly, concerning the phrase <b>“It may not</b> |
| Leviticus 27:28 | and it is stated: “And it shall not be redeemed,” with regard to dedications [ baḥaramim ], | Bekhorot 32a:8 | <b>Rav Ḥinnana says</b> that <b>Rav says, and similarly, Rav Dimi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is stated: “It shall not be redeemed,” with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and it is stated: “And it shall not be redeemed,” with regard to dedications [<i>baḥaramim</i>],</b> i.e., property that one consecrated by means of the expression: <i>Ḥerem</i>. With regard to dedications, the verse states: “Notwithstanding, any dedicated item…may neither be sold nor redeemed” (Leviticus 27:28). This is a verbal analogy: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to dedications, the prohibition against <b>selling is</b> mentioned together <b>with</b> the prohibition against redeeming, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the animal tithe offering, the prohibition against <b>selling is</b> mentioned together <b>with</b> the prohibition against redeeming. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | hear: “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing | Gittin 38b:12 | The Gemara raises another objection from a <i>baraita</i> to the opinion of Rav: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing</b> that a man may dedicate to the Lord from all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed” (Leviticus 27:28). The Sages interpret the verse as follows: <b>“Of man”; these are his Canaanite slaves and maidservants.</b> This demonstrates that one may consecrate his slaves and they are not emancipated as a result. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the master <b>said</b> explicitly that he is consecrating them <b>with regard to their monetary</b> value. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | for Temple maintenance, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred unto the Lord” | Sanhedrin 88a:4 | In <b>the</b> case of <b>dedications,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 28b): <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: Dedications</b> dedicated <b>without specification</b> of their purpose are designated <b>for Temple maintenance, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). |
| Leviticus 27:28 | dedicated | Temurah 32a:11 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But Rav Huna says a verse</b> as the source for his opinion. Since his opinion is refuted, how should the verse be interpreted? <b>Ulla said:</b> That verse is not interpreted in the manner of Rav Huna. The <b>verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding, no dedicated item that a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of his ancestral field, shall be sold or redeemed; every <b>dedicated</b> item is most holy unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28). The emphasis that <b>“every dedicated item”</b> is most holy indicates that a dedication to the priests takes effect on every item, even with regard to animals consecrated for the altar. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | every dedicated item is most holy unto the Lord” | Temurah 32a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to animals <b>consecrated for the altar, if one associated</b> such objects of his vow <b>with dedications</b> for the <b>priests,</b> i.e., he vowed to give their value as a dedication to the priests, <b>he has done nothing. What is the reason? The verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding, no devoted item that a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of his ancestral field, shall be sold or redeemed; <b>every dedicated item is most holy unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). The verse is interpreted to mean that <b>any dedicated</b> item <b>that is most holy,</b> i.e., that was consecrated for the altar and then dedicated to the priests, <b>that</b> item <b>should be for the Lord,</b> and the priests are not entitled to it. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | verse | Temurah 32b:2 | The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one who associates an animal consecrated for the altar with a consecration for Temple maintenance must give the value of the animal for Temple maintenance, was instituted by <b>the Sages;</b> by Torah law, there is only the delay attributed to the treasurers. This is also the opinion of Ulla. <b>And</b> as for the <b>verse</b> that Ulla cites as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that an animal consecrated for the altar can be associated with dedications to priests (Leviticus 27:28), it is mere support for this rabbinic law. The verse actually <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that</b> one is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> in the case of dedications to priests. |
| Leviticus 27:28 | shall be sold or redeemed; | Temurah 5a:16 | The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>dedications</b> of property to the priests, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “No</b> devoted item, that a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, <b>shall be sold or redeemed;</b> every devoted item is most holy unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 28b): <b>Items dedicated to priests are not redeemed; rather, one gives them to the priest. Apparently,</b> if one transgresses the prohibition and redeems a dedicated item, his action <b>is not effective.</b> This seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:28 | “It shall not be sold or redeemed” | Zevachim 9a:9 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> that if one <b>slaughtered</b> a Paschal offering <b>for the sake of a substitute, let it be</b> rendered <b>a substitute.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> does it matter, practically speaking, that it has been rendered a substitute rather than a peace offering? The one who slaughtered it <b>should be flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition of effecting substitution. <b>Also,</b> its sale <b>should be determined to</b> violate the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be sold or redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). |
| Leviticus 27:29 | shall not be redeemed” | Arakhin 6b:10 | The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that in the case of <b>one who</b> is being <b>taken to be executed and</b> who <b>said: My valuation is upon me</b> to donate to the Temple, <b>that he did not say anything,</b> and the valuation is not collected from his estate? <b>The verse states: “Anything dedicated [<i>ḥerem</i>],</b> that may be dedicated of men, <b>shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:29). This teaches that with regard to one who is worthy of excommunication [<i>ḥerem</i>], i.e., condemned to death, one cannot redeem him, i.e., pay his valuation. One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even before his verdict is issued,</b> i.e., that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one issued this statement before being sentenced to death. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of men,” and not all men,</b> i.e., only some men destined to be executed have no valuation, and not all of them. |
| Leviticus 27:29 | shall not be redeemed” | Arakhin 6b:12 | The Gemara answers that he requires it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: Since we found with regard to those executed at the hand of Heaven that they give money and their</b> sins <b>are atoned, as it is stated</b> in the case of the owner of a forewarned ox that killed a person: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death. <b>If there be laid upon him a ransom,</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him” (Exodus 21:29–30), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to those liable to receive the death penalty <b>at the hands of man</b> it is <b>so,</b> that one can pay in lieu of execution. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anything dedicated</b> that may be dedicated of men, <b>shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:29). |
| Leviticus 27:29 | as it is stated: “Anything dedicated [ ḥerem ], that may be dedicated of men [ yoḥoram ], shall not be redeemed” | Ketubot 37b:10 | It is derived <b>as it is stated: “Anything dedicated [<i>ḥerem</i>], that may be dedicated of men [<i>yoḥoram</i>], shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:29). This verse is taken to mean that anything dedicated, through which a man who is condemned [<i>yoḥoram</i>] is valuated, shall not be redeemed, as the person in question is already considered dead. One <b>might</b> think that <b>even before his verdict</b> is issued this should be <b>so,</b> and that one who said: The valuation of so-and-so on trial for murder is upon me, said nothing of consequence. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “That may be dedicated <b>of men,”</b> implying “of men,” <b>but not entire men.</b> If it is valuation of an entire man, one not yet sentenced to death, it is binding. If it is valuation of a partial man, one sentenced to death, it is not binding. |
| Leviticus 27:29 | the verse states: “Dedicated of men shall not be redeemed” | Ketubot 37b:12 | The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it</b> to teach <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: Because we found with regard to those executed at the hand of Heaven,</b> and not through court-administered execution, <b>that they give money and their</b> sins <b>are atoned, as it is stated:</b> “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death. <b>If there be laid upon him a ransom</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him” (Exodus 21:29–30). One whose ox kills a person is essentially liable to receive the death penalty at the hand of Heaven, and pays money instead. You <b>might</b> think that <b>even</b> with regard to those liable to receive the death penalty <b>at the hands of man</b> it is <b>so,</b> and one can pay in lieu of execution. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Dedicated of men shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:29). One who is executed by man cannot be redeemed with money. |
| Leviticus 27:29 | “Anything dedicated [ ḥerem ], that may be dedicated of men, shall not be redeemed; | Ketubot 37b:9 | The Gemara asks with regard to the following verse: <b>“Anything dedicated [<i>ḥerem</i>], that may be dedicated of men, shall not be redeemed;</b> he shall surely be put to death” (Leviticus 27:29), which is interpreted here as: Anyone sentenced to be executed shall not be redeemed; this appears to teach the same <i>halakha</i> as above, so <b>why do I need</b> it? The Gemara explains: <b>It is necessary</b> to teach <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> one <b>taken to be executed, and one</b> person <b>said: His valuation is upon me</b> to donate to the Temple, <b>that he did not say anything</b> and his vow is not binding? |
| Leviticus 27:29 | Rather, Rami bar Ḥama said | Ketubot 38a:4 | <b>Rather, Rami bar Ḥama said</b> that the phrase “any <i>ḥerem</i>” (Leviticus 27:29) is <b>necessary, as it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one who is liable to be executed is exempt from payment, <b>applies only</b> in a case <b>where one blinded</b> another’s <b>eye and killed him with</b> that same blow. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where one blinded</b> another’s <b>eye and killed him by</b> means of a <b>different</b> blow, <b>say: Let us take money from him</b> to pay the damage inflicted to the eye. Therefore, the verse teaches that this is not the case. <b>Rava said to him: This</b> case of one who blinded another’s eye and killed him <b>is also derived from</b> that which <b>another <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>the school of Ḥizkiyya</b> taught, <b>as</b> the Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), from which it may be inferred, <b>but not an eye and a life for an eye.</b> When he gives his life for killing another while blinding him, he need not pay the worth of the eye as well. |
| Leviticus 27:30 | and it is written with regard to second tithe: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy” | Bava Kamma69b:16 | With regard to <b>a fourth-year vineyard as well,</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> many of its <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between <b>second tithe</b> and fourth-year fruit, based on the use of the word <b>“holy”</b> in the context of fourth-year fruit and <b>“holy”</b> in the context of second tithe. <b>It is written here,</b> concerning fourth-year fruit trees: “And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be <b>holy, for giving praise</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>and it is written with regard to second tithe: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:30). |
| Leviticus 27:30 | “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord” | Kiddushin 53a:11 | § The mishna teaches: One who betroths a woman with <b>second tithe, whether unwittingly</b> or <b>intentionally, has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he did so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her, but if he did so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? From where does Rabbi Meir derive that second tithe cannot be used for betrothal? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says in the name of tradition:</b> The verse states: <b>“And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:30). This verse indicates that <b>it is for the Lord, but not for betrothing a woman with it.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:30 | tithe, | Kiddushin 54b:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel? They derive</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“holy”</b> stated with regard to a fourth-year vineyard, as the verse states: “Holy, for giving praise to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>from “holy”</b> stated with regard to second <b>tithe,</b> as the verse states: “Holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:30). This verbal analogy teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> second <b>tithe has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth and it has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal, so too,</b> the <b>fourth-year vineyard has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth and it has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal. And Beit Shammai do not derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“holy”</b> with regard to a fourth-year vineyard and <b>“holy” from</b> second <b>tithe.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:31 | “His ancestral field | Arakhin 34a:8 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> The verse <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written</b> with regard to the fields of Levites and priests: <b>“For that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34), from which it is derived that if a priest consecrated his ancestral field he may always redeem it, so too <b>this</b> dedicated field received by the priest <b>is also</b> considered <b>his ancestral</b> field, and if he consecrated it he may always redeem it. The juxtaposition of the dedicated field of a priest to the ancestral field of an Israelite <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>, as the verse states: <b>“His ancestral field</b> shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:31). The verse teaches that with regard to the <b>ancestral field</b> of a priest that he inherited from his father, <b>yes,</b> it remains in the possession of that priest in perpetuity, but with regard to <b>his dedicated</b> field, it does <b>not</b> remain in his possession in perpetuity; rather, it is divided among the members of the priestly watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year. |
| Leviticus 27:31 | “And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it its fifth part” | Bava Kamma69b:14 | <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that second <b>tithe is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High,</b> rather than the possession of the one who separated it from his produce, <b>and even so, with regard to redemption</b> of the second tithe <b>the Merciful One establishes it in his possession? As it is written</b> concerning the second tithe: <b>“And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it its fifth part”</b> (Leviticus 27:31). |
| Leviticus 27:31 | “And if a man will redeem of his tithe, | Bava Metzia53b:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> that it is written: <b>“And if a man will redeem of his tithe,</b> he shall add to it the fifth part thereof” (Leviticus 27:31), from which it is inferred: <b>Of his tithe, but not all his tithe.</b> This serves <b>to exclude second tithe that does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>,</b> which cannot be redeemed. <b>It was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Ami says:</b> The second tithe cannot be redeemed in a case where the produce itself <b>does not have</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The second tithe cannot be redeemed in a case where <b>its</b> additional payment of <b>one-fifth does not have</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i>. Other <i>amora’im</i> dispute the same issue. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The produce itself <b>does not have</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Its</b> additional payment of <b>one-fifth does not have</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i>. |
| Leviticus 27:31 | a man | Kiddushin 24a:2 | <b>But rather,</b> one might say that this is referring <b>to</b> a case where she uses <b>her money and</b> it is <b>his tithe.</b> This is also difficult, as in this case the Rabbis would agree that she is exempt from paying the additional fifth, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And if <b>a man</b> shall redeem any of his tithe” (Leviticus 27:31). The emphasis of the term “man” teaches: This applies to a man, <b>but</b> this does <b>not</b> apply to <b>a woman</b> who redeems her husband’s tithe. |
| Leviticus 27:31 | will redeem [ gaol yigal ] | Zevachim 6a:3 | <b>Rav Ya’akov of Nehar Pekod objects to this</b> derivation: <b>If that is so,</b> one should say the same <b>with regard to</b> the redemption of the second <b>tithe, as it is written: “And if</b> a man <b>will redeem [<i>gaol yigal</i>]</b> any of his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth part thereof” (Leviticus 27:31), with the superfluous word <i>gaol</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one who must add the one-fifth. <b>So too,</b> it should be derived from the verb’s singular form that if <b>one</b> heir <b>redeems</b> the tithe, he must add one-fifth of its value, <b>but</b> if <b>two</b> heirs <b>redeem</b> it, <b>they do not</b> need to add one-fifth. In fact, the <i>halakha</i> is that partners must also add one-fifth. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | animal tithe, | Bava Kamma78a:4 | <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>animal tithe,</b> concerning which it is written: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock [<i>tzon</i>], any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), this principle is not necessary either. The reason is that the exclusion of diverse kinds can be <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>“under”</b> in this verse, and the word <b>“under”</b> in a verse that deals with <b>sacrificial</b> animals: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother” (Leviticus 22:27). This verbal analogy, from which many <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe are derived, indicates that diverse kinds are not subject to animal tithe, just as they cannot be used for an offering. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | animal tithe: | Bava Kamma78a:5 | <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to firstborn</b> animals, concerning which it is written: “However, the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or <i>seh</i>, it is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 27:26), it is not necessary in that context either. The reason is that this can be <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>passing,</b> in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to the Lord all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term <b>passing, from</b> a verse concerning <b>animal tithe:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | The Merciful One states: | Bava Metzia7a:1 | <b>Rather, what have you to say</b> to explain why one is not required to tithe his flock in a case where a counted animal jumped back into the pen? <b>The Merciful One states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, anyone that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), from which it is derived that <b>a certain tenth</b> animal must be tithed, <b>but not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not certainly the tenth. <b>Here too,</b> the entire flock is exempt from tithe because <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a certain tenth</b> animal must be designated as tithe <b>and not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not certainly subject to tithe. Therefore, there is proof from the <i>baraita</i> that if a priest seizes an animal whose status as firstborn is uncertain, the court removes it from his possession. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “Under” | Bekhorot 12a:17 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps it is referring <b>to</b> the mitzva of the animal <b>tithe</b> and teaches that an animal that resembles an animal of another type is not tithed with the other animals. This ruling is also unnecessary, as it is <b>derived</b> via a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which is stated with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and the word: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), which is stated in the context of animal tithe. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring <b>to</b> the lamb that is used to redeem <b>a firstborn donkey,</b> and it teaches that a lamb that resembles an animal of another type is unfit for use as redemption. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | passes | Bekhorot 21b:3 | The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary, it would be</b> appropriate <b>for one to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of tithed animals <b>from sacrificial</b> animals, <b>as</b> they have the following in common: First, unlike firstborn animals, both tithed and consecrated animals are not limited to <b>males.</b> Second, both are sanctified by human action rather than intrinsically <b>consecrated.</b> Additionally, they are not included among the <b>gifts</b> to the priest. Finally, both begin life as <b>regular</b> animals rather than as animals with the unique status of being born first. The Gemara accepts this objection: <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> from a verbal analogy between the term: “You shall <b>pass”</b> (Exodus 13:12), written with regard to the firstborn, and the term: “Whatsoever <b>passes</b> under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), stated with regard to tithed animals. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | passing | Bekhorot 32a:14 | <b>Rather, let</b> the verse <b>not say: “It shall not be redeemed,” with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and</b> instead one can <b>derive</b> the prohibition <b>from a verbal analogy</b> from the term of <b>passing stated there</b> and the term of <b>passing</b> stated in the case of a firstborn. With regard to an animal tithe offering the verse states: “Whatsoever passes under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), and in the case of the firstborn offering it is stated: “And you shall cause to pass all that opens the womb, to the Lord” (Exodus 13:12). <b>Just as</b> the <b>firstborn</b> offering <b>is sacred and may not be redeemed, so too,</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering <b>is</b> also <b>sacred and may not be redeemed. Why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“It shall not be redeemed” that the Merciful One writes</b> with regard to animal tithe offerings? It is evidently <b>to</b> be considered <b>free</b> to enable the verbal analogy to dedications. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | or the flock, | Bekhorot 53a:2 | And it is in effect <b>with regard to</b> animals from <b>the new</b> flock <b>and with regard to</b> animals from <b>the old</b> flock, <b>but they are not tithed from one for the other. As by right, it should be</b> inferred: <b>If</b> in the case of animals from the <b>new</b> flock <b>and the old</b> flock, <b>which do not</b> carry the prohibition of mating <b>diverse kinds</b> when mated <b>with each other</b> because they are one species, <b>are</b> nevertheless <b>not tithed from one for the other,</b> then with regard to <b>sheep and goats, which do</b> carry the prohibition of mating <b>diverse kinds</b> when mated <b>with each other, is it not right that they will not be tithed from one for the other?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd <b>or the flock,</b> whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), indicating that with regard to animal tithe, <b>all</b> animals that are included in the term <b>flock</b> are <b>one</b> species. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “flock” | Bekhorot 53b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let us say</b> with regard to <b>sheep and goats</b> that they <b>too</b> are not tithed for each other, by the same reasoning, i.e., that the verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>animal tithe to</b> the <b>grain tithe: Just as grain tithe</b> is <b>not</b> separated <b>from</b> one <b>type</b> of grain <b>for</b> another grain <b>that is not its type, so too, animal tithe</b> is <b>not</b> separated <b>from</b> one <b>type</b> of animal <b>for</b> another species of animal <b>that is not its type.</b> The Gemara answers that with regard to animal tithe <b>the Merciful One has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> by stating <b>“flock”</b> (Leviticus 27:32). This teaches that all species referred to with the term flock, i.e., sheep and goats, are tithed together. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | shall be sacred | Bekhorot 53b:8 | The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> one can <b>say it is indeed so,</b> i.e., perhaps offerings of lesser sanctity can indeed be tithed. The Gemara responds that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth <b>shall be sacred</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This teaches that this mitzva applies only to an animal that can become sacred in the future <b>but not</b> to an animal <b>that is already sanctified,</b> e.g., that has been set aside as an offering of lesser sanctity. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | And all the tithe of the herd or the tithe of the flock, | Bekhorot 54a:5 | <b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to animal tithe, where it is not written</b> in the Torah: <b>And all the tithe of the herd or the tithe of the flock,</b> with the word “tithe” mentioned twice, once in reference to the herd and once in reference to the flock, but rather the verse states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), |
| Leviticus 27:32 | the verse states: “The tenth | Bekhorot 54b:1 | <b>let them be tithed from one for the other.</b> Abaye <b>said to him</b> that <b>the verse states: “The tenth</b> shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This indicates that one must <b>give the tenth</b> animal <b>from this,</b> the flock, <b>and give the tenth</b> animal <b>from that,</b> the herd, with each counted and given separately. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, sheep and goats</b> should <b>also</b> have to be tithed separately. The Gemara answers that the verse states: <b>“Or the flock,”</b> which <b>means</b> that <b>all</b> the goats and sheep <b>are one flock</b> and may be tithed together. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | under | Bekhorot 54b:4 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>if</b> the verse <b>had written: All the animal tithe, I would say</b> that the requirement to tithe animals applies <b>even to undomesticated animals,</b> this is not so. The reason is that one <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the animal tithe <b>from sacrificial</b> animals, via a verbal analogy of the terms “under” and “under.” With regard to sacrificial animals it states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days <b>under</b> its mother, but from the eighth day onward it may be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), and with regard to animal tithe it states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes <b>under</b> the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). It is derived through this verbal analogy that just as an undomesticated animal cannot be consecrated as an offering, so too, it cannot be tithed. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “Under” | Bekhorot 57a:10 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> as for <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>if he derives</b> the verbal analogy of: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), and: <b>“Under”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), <b>from</b> the verse referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, then <b>these</b> types listed in the <i>baraita</i> should <b>also not</b> enter the pen to be tithed, as they are all disqualified from being sacrificed. <b>And if he does not derive</b> the verbal analogy from sacrificial animals, <b>from where</b> does he derive the exemption of <b>these</b> categories listed in the mishna, e.g., one whose time has not yet arrived and an orphan? |
| Leviticus 27:32 | it is written: “Whatever passes under the rod” | Bekhorot 57a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i> of</b> the <i>baraita</i>, what does he maintain? <b>If he derives</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“under”</b> and <b>“under” from sacrificial</b> animals, then <b>these</b> categories listed by Rabbi Akiva should <b>also not</b> enter the pen to be tithed. <b>And if he does not derive</b> the verbal analogy, <b>granted,</b> he rules that <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> does not enter the pen to be tithed, as <b>it is written: “Whatever passes under the rod”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), which <b>excludes a <i>tereifa</i>, as it does not pass</b> under the rod due to its physical state. <b>But from where</b> does he derive that an animal crossbred <b>from diverse kinds</b> does not enter the pen to be tithed? |
| Leviticus 27:32 | under the rod” | Bekhorot 57a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: From where is it derived that these <i>halakhot</i> also apply to animal tithe? <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> it is learned by a verbal analogy from the term “under.” It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to animal tithe: “Whatever passes <b>under the rod”</b> (Leviticus 27:32), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there,</b> with regard to all offerings: <b>“Under its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of all offerings, the verse serves to <b>exclude all these categories, so too here,</b> with regard to animal tithe, the verse serves to <b>exclude all these categories. And just as here,</b> with regard to animal tithe, the verse serves to <b>exclude a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as the verse states: “Whatever passes under the rod,” and a <i>tereifa</i> is unable to pass unaided, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to all offerings, the verse serves to <b>exclude a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:32 | the Merciful One states: | Bekhorot 58b:2 | The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rava: <b>What are you saying?</b> Why are the five animals born in Tishrei exempt? <b>Let them combine</b> with animals at <b>another</b> time of <b>gathering</b> to form a total of ten. Rather, what is the reason one is not required to tithe these five animals born in Tishrei? It is because <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), from which it is derived that <b>a definite tenth</b> must be tithed, <b>and not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not definitely the tenth. If the first of Elul is the new year, then the five born in Tishrei would have combined with the five of Elul and are exempt. Therefore, the obligation in this case is uncertain. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | with a rod | Bekhorot 58b:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>In what manner does one tithe</b> the animals? <b>He gathers them in a pen and provides them with a small,</b> i.e., narrow, <b>opening, so that two</b> animals <b>will not be able to emerge together. And he counts</b> the animals as they emerge: <b>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine; and he paints</b> the animal <b>that emerges tenth with red paint and declares: This is tithe.</b> Even if <b>he did not paint it with red paint, or if he did not count</b> the animals <b>with a rod</b> in accordance with the verse: “Whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), <b>or if he counted</b> the animals when they were <b>prone or standing</b> in place and did not make them pass through a narrow opening, <b>these</b> animals <b>are tithed</b> after the fact. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | passes | Bekhorot 58b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is it performed this way? Let the owner simply <b>make them emerge</b> from the pen by pushing them. The Gemara answers that it is <b>written:</b> “Whatever <b>passes</b> under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This means that the animal must pass under the rod of its own volition, <b>and not that</b> one <b>will cause it to pass</b> by pushing it out of the pen. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “Whatever passes under | Bekhorot 58b:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Whatever passes under</b> the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32); this teaches that all animals may be sanctified as animal tithe, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>, as</b> on account of its physical state <b>it does not pass</b> under the rod. The phrase <b>“under the rod”</b> teaches that it is <b>a mitzva to count them with a rod. If one did not count them with a rod, or he counted them</b> when they were <b>prone or standing, from where</b> is it derived that the tenth animal is nevertheless sanctified? <b>The verse states: “The tenth shall be sacred,”</b> indicating that the tenth animal is sacred <b>in any case,</b> even if it was not tithed correctly. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | passes | Bekhorot 59b:10 | <b>Rather, Rava says the verse states:</b> “Whatever <b>passes</b> under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This indicates that only an animal that will pass under the rod must be tithed, <b>but not</b> an animal <b>that</b> has <b>already passed</b> under the rod. Rava elaborates: <b>What</b> it the meaning of: An animal <b>that</b> has <b>already passed? If</b> it means <b>that one has separated tithe for it, is it necessary</b> for a verse <b>to state</b> this? Of course an animal that has been tithed does not need to be tithed again. <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the animals <b>have become exempt through a tally fit</b> to reach ten? <b>Conclude from this</b> that a tally fit to reach ten renders an animal exempt from being tithed. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | The verse states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” | Bekhorot 60b:2 | <b>The verse states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:32). This indicates that the tenth animal that passes under the rod is imbued with sanctity, in addition to any animal that the owner designates as the tenth. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include even</b> the <b>eighth</b> animal <b>or</b> the <b>twelfth</b> animal, if they were mistakenly designated as the tenth. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | tithe does not apply to limbs and fetuses | Chullin 69b:3 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: Actually,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the fetus and its severed pieces are permitted <b>should be</b> derived <b>as you</b> previously <b>said,</b> i.e., from the phrase: An animal in the animal. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which posed a difficulty for you,</b> i.e., the mishna in <i>Temura</i> that states <b>one cannot substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for the fetus of a pregnant offering, that difficulty can be resolved by saying: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who compares substitution to</b> the animal <b>tithe: Just as the</b> animal <b>tithe does not apply to limbs and fetuses</b> but only to live animals that can walk, as it is stated: “Whatever passes under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), <b>so too, substitution does not apply to limbs and fetuses.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:32 | a firstborn | Meilah 13a:10 | <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami said: It is derived</b> through a verbal analogy of the expressions <b>“passing”</b> and <b>“passing,” from</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> offering. With regard to animal tithe the verse states: “Whatsoever passes under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), and with regard to the firstborn offering it is stated: “And you shall cause to pass all that opens the womb, to the Lord” (Exodus 13:12). <b>Just as</b> in the case of the <b>firstborn</b> offering one is liable for <b>misusing</b> all of <b>it,</b> as it is a male and does not have milk, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>milk of a tithed</b> animal one is liable for <b>misusing</b> all of <b>it,</b> i.e., all of it is forbidden, including its milk, as it is part of the tithed animal. Therefore, the offspring may not suckle from the mother. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “Whatever passes under the rod, | Menachot 6a:16 | Alternatively, this <i>halakha</i> can be <b>derived from</b> a verse discussing animal tithe offerings: <b>“Whatever passes under the rod,</b> the tenth shall be holy for the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This teaches that all animals may be sacrificed as the animal tithe, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>, as it does not pass</b> under the rod on account of its weakness, and the Sages derived from this the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for any type of offering. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | a firstborn | Temurah 18b:4 | <b>Ravina said:</b> The verse serves <b>to include,</b> in the limitation that the offspring of other sacrificial animals are not sacrificed, <b>the offspring of</b> an animal that was consecrated as animal <b>tithe</b> and then gave birth. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include <b>the offspring of</b> the animal <b>tithe? It is derived through</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> mentioned with regard to animal tithe, and the word <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> mentioned with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> animal, which is male and cannot give birth to offspring. With regard to animal tithe the verse states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), and with regard to a firstborn, the verse states: “And you shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] for the Lord all that opens the womb; every firstborn that is a male, which you have that comes of an animal, shall be the Lord’s” (Exodus 13:12). |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “The tenth | Temurah 21a:8 | <b>Rather, what is different</b> about the <b>ninth</b> animal, which one called the tenth, <b>that you did not raise the dilemma</b> about it? It is <b>because the Merciful One excluded it,</b> with the verse: <b>“The tenth</b> shall be holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), which serves <b>to exclude</b> from the altar <b>the ninth</b> that was mistakenly declared to be the tenth. One may derive from here that one who inflicts a blemish upon this ninth animal is not liable. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | whatsoever passes under the rod, | Temurah 29a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t the <i>halakha</i>, that an animal which became a <i>tereifa</i> after it was consecrated is prohibited to be sacrificed, <b>derived from here,</b> a verse that deals with the animal tithe: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, <b>whatsoever passes under the rod,</b> the tenth shall be holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). The phrase: “Whatsoever passes under the rod,” indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of animal tithe applies only to an animal that can pass under the rod, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> e.g., if its leg was cut above the knee, <b>which cannot pass</b> under the rod. From this paradigm case of a <i>tereifa</i>, the exception is expanded to apply to all <i>tereifot</i>. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “ avara ” | Temurah 5b:13 | The Gemara explains that Abaye could <b>say to you: It is different there, as one derives</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a firstborn offering, by verbal analogy between the term <b>“<i>avara</i>”</b> that is stated with regard to an animal tithe offering: “Whatsoever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), and the term <b>“<i>avara</i>”</b> that is stated with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering: “You shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] to the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12). It was already derived above that a firstborn offering cannot be redeemed. But in general, transgressions are effective. |
| Leviticus 27:32 | “The tenth shall be sacred” | Zevachim 9a:6 | The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the animal tithe: <b>“The tenth shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:32). The definite article indicates that <b>this,</b> the tenth animal, is the <b>tithe, but another</b> animal slaughtered for its sake is <b>not a tithe.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:33 | it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed” | Bava Kamma13a:11 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> offering <b>it is stated: “You shall not redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:17), indicating that the owner can never fully redeem the offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the firstborn offering <b>can be sold</b> when it is <b>unblemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> when it is <b>blemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> blemished and <b>slaughtered. With regard to</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings, <b>it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), indicating that the one who designated it can never fully redeem an animal tithe offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the animal tithe offering <b>cannot be sold, not</b> when it is <b>alive and not</b> when it is <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> The fact that the sale of an animal tithe offering is invalid demonstrates that it is not the property of the one who designated it. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed” | Bava Kamma13a:7 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> offering <b>it is stated: “You shall not redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:17), indicating that the owner can never fully redeem the offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the firstborn offering <b>can be sold</b> when it is <b>unblemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> when it is <b>blemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> blemished and <b>slaughtered. With regard to</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings, <b>it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), indicating that the one who designated it can never fully redeem an animal tithe offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the animal tithe offering <b>cannot be sold, not</b> when it is <b>alive and not</b> when it is <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> The fact that the sale of an animal tithe offering is invalid demonstrates that it is not the property of the one who designated it. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | with its blemish, as it is written: “He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad” | Bekhorot 14b:8 | The Gemara inquires: <b>But</b> still, one can <b>say: If</b> the verse in chapter 17 <b>is not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>matter of sacrificial</b> animals, which is derived from the verse in Leviticus, <b>apply it to</b> the <b>matter of</b> the animal <b>tithe, as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> a tithed animal is <b>sacred</b> even <b>with its blemish, as it is written: “He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), <b>let it also be sacrificed with its blemish.</b> The verse in Deuteronomy (17:1) would therefore <b>teach us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, i.e., a blemished tithed animal may not be sacrificed upon the altar. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | “Then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed” | Bekhorot 31b:18 | <b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that the meat of an animal tithe offering belonging to an adult may be sold by inclusion? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the animal tithe offering: <b>“Then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33). This indicates that a non-sacred animal designated as a substitute for an animal tithe offering assumes sacred status, while the animal tithe offering retains its sacred status as well. As stated earlier, the phrase “it shall not be redeemed” is interpreted as referring to the prohibition against selling the animal tithe offering. The verse’s juxtaposition of substitution and the prohibition against selling an animal tithe offering indicates a similarity between the two. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | is stated: “It shall not be redeemed” | Bekhorot 31b:7 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> animal it <b>is stated: “You shall not redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:17), indicating that its sanctity can never be removed from it and transferred to non-sacred objects. <b>But it can be sold</b> after it comes into the possession of the priest, while it is <b>alive.</b> By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, it <b>is stated: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), which teaches that its sanctity can never be removed from it, <b>and it cannot be sold</b> either, as the Gemara will explain (32a–b), <b>not</b> when <b>alive and not</b> when <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> This <i>baraita</i> clearly states that the animal tithe offering may not be sold no matter what its status, which seems to contradict the mishna. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed” | Bekhorot 32a:7 | § The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> male animal offering the verse <b>states: “You shall not redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:17), <b>but it may be sold</b> while alive, by the priest to whom it belongs. By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), indicating that its sanctity can never be removed from it, <b>and it cannot be sold, not</b> when <b>alive and not</b> when <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived, that the phrase “it shall not be redeemed” is referring to the prohibition against selling the animal tithe offering? |
| Leviticus 27:33 | says: From where do I say this? As it is written: “Then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed” | Bekhorot 32b:2 | § <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that the prohibition against selling the animal tithe offering is not derived from dedications, but rather from the case of the animal tithe offering itself. The phrase <b>“It may not be redeemed,”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, is to be understood as meaning: <b>It may not be sold. Rav Ashi</b> further <b>says: From where do I say this? As it is written: “Then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33). |
| Leviticus 27:33 | the Merciful One states: “He shall not search whether it be good or bad” | Bekhorot 36b:15 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>he</b> intentionally <b>leads</b> an animal <b>out as the head of the ten,</b> i.e., so that it is the last of ten to emerge, one may not do so, as <b>the Merciful One states: “He shall not search whether it be good or bad”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), which teaches that the animal tithe may not be led out intentionally but must exit of its own accord. <b>Rather,</b> this is the meaning of the Gemara’s initial answer: The reason is <b>that had he wanted, he could have caused a blemish in his entire flock,</b> in a permitted manner, before leading them through the gate in order to tithe them. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | of: “It shall not be redeemed” | Bekhorot 53b:12 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>What difference is</b> there if an animal that has been consecrated as a peace offering is also sanctified as an animal tithe offering? The Gemara explains that if it is sanctified as an animal tithe offering, the prohibition <b>of: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>of: It shall not be sold</b> (see 32b), take effect. A peace offering can be redeemed, whereas it is prohibited to redeem or sell animal tithe even after its slaughter. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the sanctity of animal tithe does not take effect on animals that have been consecrated as offerings of lesser sanctity. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | the Merciful One states: “He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad” | Bekhorot 53b:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>How</b> can one <b>know which</b> animal will <b>emerge</b> as the tenth? Since it is impossible to know this, one cannot inflict a blemish on the animal before it becomes consecrated. <b>And if you would say that</b> one should <b>bring out</b> the animal upon which he has inflicted the blemish <b>at the head of</b> the <b>ten</b> animals to ensure that it will be the tithed animal, this is not a valid option, as <b>the Merciful One states: “He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad”</b> (Leviticus 27:33). This means one may not plan in advance which animal will be the tenth. |
| Leviticus 27:33 | does not disqualify it, as it is written: “He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it” | Bekhorot 57a:13 | <b>And</b> the juxtaposition of the word “corruption” with the word “blemish” in Leviticus 22:25 teaches that in <b>any</b> case <b>where a blemish disqualifies</b> an animal, <b>a matter of licentiousness or</b> a matter of <b>idol worship also disqualifies it. And</b> in a case <b>where a blemish does not disqualify</b> an animal, <b>a matter of licentiousness or</b> a matter of <b>idol worship</b> also <b>does not disqualify it. And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> animal <b>tithe, since a blemish</b> on an animal <b>does not disqualify it, as it is written: “He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), <b>a matter of licentiousness or</b> a matter of <b>idol worship also does not disqualify it.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:33 | “He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, neither shall he substitute it; | Temurah 13a:15 | § The mishna teaches that consecrated animals belonging to the community or to partners are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of substitution. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the animal tithe: <b>“He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, neither shall he substitute it;</b> and if he substitute it at all, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred; it shall not be redeemed” (Leviticus 27:33). <b>Why is</b> the issue of substitution <b>stated</b> here in connection to the animal tithe? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> earlier: <b>“He shall not alter it, nor substitute it, good for bad,</b> or bad for good, and if he substitutes an animal for an animal, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:10)? |
| Leviticus 27:33 | the substitute of its body is not redeemed, | Temurah 13b:3 | Furthermore, the verse <b>tells you</b> other <i>halakhot</i> unique to the animal tithe: An animal that is <b>the substitute of the name of</b> an animal tithe is <b>sacrificed</b> upon the altar as a peace offering, whereas <b>the substitute of its body is not sacrificed</b> at all. But for all other offerings, substitutes hold the same status as the animal for which they were substituted. Another difference is that <b>the substitute of the name of</b> an animal tithe is <b>redeemed</b> when it develops a blemish, like a peace offering, and the proceeds of the sale belong to the Temple treasury, whereas <b>the substitute of its body is not redeemed,</b> as it is stated with regard to the animal tithe: “Then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred; it shall not be redeemed” (Leviticus 27:33). |
| Leviticus 27:33 | “It shall not be redeemed” | Temurah 5b:1 | <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, this</b> term: <b>“Is</b> most holy,” serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> offering from the prohibition of sale. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated with regard to a firstborn</b> offering: “But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, <b>you shall not redeem;</b> they are holy” (Numbers 18:17). <b>But</b> if it develops a blemish <b>it</b> may still be <b>sold.</b> By contrast, <b>it is stated with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering: <b>“It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), <b>and</b> the animal tithe may <b>not be sold, not</b> when <b>alive and not</b> when <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:33 | which the Merciful One states: “It shall not be redeemed” | Temurah 5b:12 | The Gemara continues its analysis of the dispute between Abaye and Rava. <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>an animal tithe</b> offering, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (21a): All sacrificial animals that became blemished <b>are subject to redemption</b> through sale, <b>and their substitutes</b> are also subject to redemption through sale, <b>except for the firstborn and the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering. <b>Apparently,</b> if one attempts to redeem an animal tithe offering, his act <b>is not effective,</b> and this seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:33 | “Then both it and that for which it is changed | Zevachim 9a:10 | <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, says:</b> It is derived from that which <b>the verse states</b> with regard to substitution: <b>“Then both it and that for which it is changed</b> shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:33). The verse teaches that only <b>it,</b> the animal substituted, is <b>a substitute, but another</b> animal is <b>not a substitute.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:33 | “It shall not be redeemed” | Zevachim 9a:5 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Savriyu, objects to this</b> answer: If so, <b>say</b> that if one <b>slaughtered</b> a Paschal offering <b>for the sake of</b> the animal <b>tithe, let it be</b> rendered animal <b>tithe,</b> which, like a Paschal offering, is an offering of lesser sanctity. The Gemara adds: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> does it matter, practically speaking, that a Paschal offering has been rendered an animal tithe rather than a peace offering? It matters <b>because</b> if it is rendered an animal tithe, <b>it should not require libations. And</b> furthermore, if one sells it, he <b>should be flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), which applies to the animal tithe even after its slaughter. |
| Leviticus 27:34 | Isn’t it written: “These are the commandments | Megillah 2b:24 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Isn’t it written: “These are the commandments</b> that the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai” (Leviticus 27:34), which indicates <b>that a prophet is not permitted to initiate</b> or change <b>any matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>from now on?</b> Consequently, how could the prophets establish new forms for the letters? <b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> The letters <b><i>mem</i> and <i>samekh</i> in the tablets</b> of the covenant given at Sinai |
| Leviticus 27:34 | “these are the commandments” | Megillah 3a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> however, doesn’t the phrase <b>“these are the commandments”</b> (Leviticus 27:34) indicate <b>that a prophet is not permitted to initiate any matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>from now on? Rather,</b> it may be suggested that the final letters already existed at the time of the giving of the Torah, but over the course of time the people <b>forgot them,</b> and the prophets <b>then</b> came and <b>reestablished them.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:34 | And is that reasonable? Isn’t it written: “These are the commandments | Shabbat 104a:2 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>And is that reasonable? Isn’t it written: “These are the commandments</b> that the Lord commanded Moses to tell the children of Israel at Mount Sinai” (Leviticus 27:34). The word “these” underscores <b>that a prophet is not permitted to introduce any</b> new <b>element</b> related to the Torah and its mitzvot <b>from here on. Rather,</b> the prophets did not innovate these forms. Both the open and closed versions <b>existed</b> before then. However, people <b>did not know which</b> form appeared <b>in the middle of a word</b> and <b>which</b> form <b>at the end of a word. And the prophets came</b> and <b>instituted their</b> set positions. The Gemara asks: <b>And still</b> the question remains: Didn’t the Sages derive from the verse: <b>“These are the commandments,” that a prophet is not permitted to introduce any</b> new <b>element from here on?</b> How could they institute the position of the letters? <b>Rather,</b> over the course of time, the people <b>forgot their</b> positions in the words <b>and</b> the prophets <b>then reestablished their</b> positions. Apparently, closed letters are no more significant than the open ones. |
| Leviticus 27:34 | “These are the commandments | Temurah 16a:4 | Many years later the Jewish people again <b>said to Samuel: Ask</b> for halakhic guidance from Heaven. <b>He said to them:</b> This is not possible, as the Torah states: <b>“These are the commandments</b> that the Lord commanded Moses to tell the children of Israel at Mount Sinai” (Leviticus 27:34). The word “these” indicates <b>that from now</b> on <b>a prophet is not permitted to introduce any</b> new <b>element</b> related to the Torah and its mitzvot through prophecy. With regard to the topic of the chapter, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says: Also,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sin offering whose owner has died was</b> one of those <b>forgotten during the days of mourning for Moses.</b> |
| Leviticus 27:34 | “These are the mitzvot | Yevamot 20a:14 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda switches</b> the terms: <b>A prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> is referring to <b>a widow to the High Priest,</b> or <b>a divorcée or a <i>ḥalutza</i> to a common priest. And why is this called a prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva? As it is written</b> in summarization at the end of Leviticus: <b>“These are the <i>mitzvot</i></b> that the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai” (Leviticus 27:34). |
| Leviticus 27:34 | Isn’t it written: “These are the mitzvot which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel at Mount Sinai” | Yoma 80a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Measures of punishments are <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Others say:</b> These measures <b>were instituted by the court of Jabez.</b> The Gemara questions this: How can this be? <b>Isn’t it written: “These are the mitzvot which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel at Mount Sinai”</b> (Leviticus 27:34). The word “these” underscores <b>that a prophet is not permitted to introduce</b> any new <b>element</b> related to the Torah and its mitzvot <b>from here on. Rather,</b> over the course of time, the people <b>forgot</b> the measures; subsequently the prophets <b>reestablished</b> the measures and taught them to the masses. |
