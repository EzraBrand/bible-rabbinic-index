| Taharot 4:12 | But didn’t we learn | Nedarim 18b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a problem with the principle stated in the mishna that unspecified vows are treated stringently. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Taharot</i> 4:12): <b>Uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>naziriteship</b> is treated <b>leniently?</b> And naziriteship is a type of vow. |
