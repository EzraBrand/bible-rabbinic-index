| Ma'asrot 4:2 | there: | Beitzah 34b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> (Ma'asrot 4:2) <b>Children who hid figs</b> for themselves in a field <b>on Shabbat eve</b> in order to eat them on Shabbat, <b>and they forgot and did not separate tithes,</b> not only are they prohibited from eating them on Shabbat, for eating on Shabbat is always considered a fixed meal that obligates the produce in tithes, but even <b>after the conclusion of Shabbat, they may not eat until they have separated tithes. And we also learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who transfers figs in his courtyard in order to</b> make them into <b>dry</b> figs, <b>his children and the members of his household may</b> in the meantime <b>partake of them</b> in <b>a casual</b> manner, <b>and they are exempt</b> from tithes. The fact that the fruit has reached his courtyard, as opposed to his house, is not enough to cause it to be liable for tithing. |
