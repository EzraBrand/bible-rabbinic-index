| Number 5:22 | With regard to what does she say: “Amen, amen” | Sotah 18a:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>With regard to what does she say: “Amen, amen”</b> (Number 5:22), twice, as recorded in the verse? The mishna explains that it includes of the following: <b>Amen on the curse,</b> as she accepts the curse upon herself if she is guilty, and <b>amen on the oath,</b> as she declares that she is not defiled. She states: <b>Amen</b> if I committed adultery <b>with this man</b> about whom I was warned, <b>amen</b> if I committed adultery <b>with another man. Amen that I did not stray</b> when I was <b>betrothed nor</b> after I was <b>married,</b> |
| Number 15:24 | “Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation” | Horayot 5b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Meir, from where do they</b> derive the fact <b>that</b> the <b>ruling is dependent on</b> the <b>court and</b> the <b>action is dependent on the congregation? Abaye said</b> that they derive it from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> in the passive form: <b>“Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Number 15:24), indicating that the action of the congregation was generated by the ruling of the court. <b>Rava said:</b> It is derived <b>from</b> that which is stated: <b>“For all the people</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:26). The term “all the people” indicates that the unwitting action is common to all, the court through its ruling and the people through their action. |
| Number 15:24 | “Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation” | Horayot 5b:2 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> both of the verses are <b>necessary. As, had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Number 15:24), <b>I would say:</b> There is liability to bring an offering <b>even</b> if only <b>a minority</b> of the congregation sinned. <b>Therefore, it is written: “For all the people it was performed unwittingly.” And had</b> the Merciful One <b>written</b> only: <b>“For all the people</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly,” I would say:</b> There is no liability <b>unless</b> the <b>court performs</b> the transgression <b>together with the majority</b> of the congregation, as the verse appears to refer to a single unwitting action. <b>Therefore, it is written: “Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation,”</b> indicating that the unwitting act was performed on the basis of the ruling of the court, and the action of the court is not significant in this regard. |
