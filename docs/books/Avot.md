| Avot 1:1 | Be temperate in judgment | Sanhedrin 7b:12 | <b>Bar Kappara taught,</b> based on a homiletical interpretation of a verse: <b>From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived: <b>Be temperate in judgment</b> (<i>Avot</i> 1:1)? <b>As it is written: “Neither shall you go up by steps</b> onto My altar” (Exodus 20:23), i.e., do not ascend hurriedly, <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“Now these are the ordinances</b> that you shall set before them” (Exodus 21:1). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a judge may not step over the heads of the sacred nation,</b> walking among those assembled for the lecture, who would sit upon the floor, in such a manner that he has the appearance of stepping on them? It is derived from that <b>which is stated: “Neither shall you go up by steps,” and juxtaposed to it</b> is an introduction to civil laws and courtroom regulations: <b>“Now these are the ordinances.”</b> This indicates that the prohibition against ascending upon steps applies to judges. |
| Avot 1:3 | His mitzvot. And this is the same as we learned | Avodah Zarah19a:4 | The verse continues: <b>“He delights greatly in His mitzvot.” Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The person delights <b>in His mitzvot</b> themselves <b>and not in the reward</b> for performing <b>His mitzvot. And this is the same as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Avot</i> 1:3): Antigonus of Sokho <b>would say: Do not be like</b> the <b>servants who serve the master on the condition of receiving a reward; rather, be like</b> the <b>servants who serve the master not on the condition that</b> they <b>receive a reward.</b> |
| Avot 1:13 | there | Megillah 28b:14 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Avot</i> 1:13): <b>And one who makes use of the crown [<i>taga</i>]</b> of Torah learning <b>will perish</b> from the world. <b>Reish Lakish taught: This</b> is referring to <b>one who</b> allows himself to be <b>served by one who studies <i>halakhot</i>,</b> which is <b>the crown of the Torah.</b> |
| Avot 2:1 | measure for the granting of their reward? But didn’t we learn | Nedarim 39b:15 | § Returning to the topic of visiting the ill, the Gemara states: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The mitzva of <b>visiting the ill has no</b> fixed <b>measure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Has no</b> fixed <b>measure? Rav Yosef thought to say: There is no</b> fixed <b>measure for the granting of its reward. Abaye said to him: And do all</b> other <b>mitzvot have</b> a fixed <b>measure for the granting of their reward? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Avot</i> 2:1): <b>Be</b> as <b>meticulous in</b> the observance of <b>a minor mitzva as a major one, as you do not know the granting of reward for mitzvot. Rather, Abaye said:</b> There is no fixed measure for the disparity between the ill person and his visitor, as <b>even a prominent</b> person pays a visit <b>to a lowly</b> person and should not say that doing so is beneath a person of his standing. <b>Rava said:</b> There is no fixed measure for the number of times that one should visit the ill, as <b>even one hundred times a day</b> is appropriate. |
| Avot 2:14 | there | Sanhedrin 38b:13 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (Avot 2:14): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Be persistent to learn Torah, and know what to respond to the heretic [<i>la’apikoros</i>]. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This was <b>taught only</b> with regard to <b>a gentile heretic, but</b> not with regard to <b>a Jewish heretic,</b> as one should not respond to him. <b>All the more so,</b> if one does respond <b>he will become more heretical.</b> His heresy is assumed to be intentional, and any attempt to rebut it will only cause him to reinforce his position. |
| Avot 3:2 | swallow the other. And this is as we learned | Avodah Zarah4a:3 | <b>Alternatively, just as</b> in the case of <b>fish of the sea, any</b> fish <b>that is bigger than another swallows the other, so too</b> in the case of <b>people, were it not for the fear of</b> the ruling <b>government, anyone who is bigger than another</b> would <b>swallow the other. And this is as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Avot</i> 3:2) that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy</b> High <b>Priest, says: One should pray for the</b> continued <b>welfare of the government, as were it not for the fear of the government,</b> every <b>man would swallow his neighbor alive.</b> |
| Avot 4:13 | we learned | Bava Metzia33b:3 | In the phrase <b>“declare to My people their transgression,” these</b> people <b>are the Torah scholars, whose unwitting</b> transgressions <b>become for them tantamount to intentional</b> transgressions. Due to their erudition, they are held to a higher standard. <b>“And to the house of Jacob their sins,” these are the ignoramuses, whose intentional</b> transgressions <b>become for them tantamount to unwitting</b> transgressions. Due to their lack of erudition, they are held to a lower standard. <b>And that is</b> the basis of that which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (Avot 4:13), that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Be careful in</b> the study of <b>the Talmud, as</b> a transgression based on <b>an unwitting</b> misinterpretation of the <b>Talmud is considered an intentional</b> transgression. |
| Avot 4:15 | can say this to him: Be a tail to the lions and do not be a head to the foxes | Sanhedrin 37a:9 | § The mishna teaches that there are <b>three rows</b> of Torah scholars who sit before the court, and if one of the Torah scholars from the first row is elevated to a place on the court, the Torah scholar in the first position of the second row moves to the final position of the first row. <b>Abaye says: Learn from</b> the mishna that <b>when they move,</b> i.e., when the Torah scholars need to move as a result of one of them being elevated to the court, <b>they all move.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>But let</b> the one being moved from the first position of the second row to the last position of the first row <b>say to</b> the court: <b>Until now I was sitting at the head</b> of the row, but <b>now you are seating me at the tail,</b> i.e., the end, of a row. <b>Abaye says</b> in explanation: That is not a valid claim, <b>as</b> the court <b>can say this to him: Be a tail to the lions and do not be a head to the foxes</b> (<i>Avot</i> 4:15), meaning that it is preferable to be the least among great people than the greatest among lesser people. |
