| Genesis 1:5 | one day, as it is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” | Berakhot 26a:17 | On the topic of one who forgot to pray and seeks to compensate for the prayer that he missed, <b>a dilemma was raised before them</b> in the study hall: <b>One who erred and did not recite the afternoon prayer, what is</b> the ruling? May he <b>recite</b> in <b>the evening prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers? The Gemara articulates the sides of the dilemma: <b>If you say</b> that <b>one who erred and did not pray the evening prayer prays in the morning prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers, perhaps that is <b>because</b> the evening and the morning are both part of <b>one day, as it is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5); the evening and the following morning constitute a single unit. <b>But here,</b> in the case under discussion, perhaps <b>prayer is in place of sacrifice.</b> Since in the case of sacrifice we say, <b>since its day passed, its sacrifice is invalid</b> and there is no way to compensate for the missed opportunity, the same should be true for prayer. <b>Or, perhaps, since prayer is supplication, any time that one wishes, he may continue to pray?</b> |
| Genesis 1:5 | “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day” | Berakhot 2a:9 | However, there is another possible explanation for why the mishna opens with the evening <i>Shema</i> rather than with the morning <i>Shema</i>. <b>If you wish,</b> you could <b>say</b> instead that the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> the precedence of the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>from the</b> order of the <b>creation of the world. As it is written</b> in the story of creation: <b>“And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). According to this verse, day begins with the evening and not the morning. For both of these reasons it was appropriate to open the discussion of the laws of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> with the evening <i>Shema</i>. |
| Genesis 2:7 | Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda interpreted homiletically: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Then the Lord God formed [ vayyitzer ] man” | Berakhot 61a:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda interpreted homiletically: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Then the Lord God formed [<i>vayyitzer</i>] man”</b> (Genesis 2:7), <b>with a double <i>yod</i>?</b> This double <i>yod</i> alludes to that fact that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, created two inclinations; one a good inclination and one an evil inclination.</b> |
| Genesis 2:10 | the verse states: “And a river went out from Eden to water the Garden” | Berakhot 34b:26 | <b>And lest you will say: It is</b> the <b>Garden and it is Eden;</b> two names describing the same place. That is not the case, as <b>the verse states: “And a river went out from Eden to water the Garden”</b> (Genesis 2:10). Obviously, the <b>Garden</b> exists <b>on its own and Eden</b> exists <b>on its own.</b> |
| Genesis 2:21 | and closed up the place with flesh in its place” | Berakhot 61a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>face, that is</b> why <b>it is written:</b> “And He took one of his sides <b>and closed up the place with flesh in its place”</b> (Genesis 2:21), as it was necessary to close the side that was open. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was originally a <b>tail, what is</b> meant by the verse: <b>“And closed up the place with flesh in its place”? Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say Rav Zevid</b> said, <b>and some say Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> said: <b>It was necessary</b> to say that <b>only with regard to the place of the incision.</b> |
| Genesis 2:22 | built | Berakhot 61a:16 | The Gemara challenges the other opinion: <b>Granted, according to the one</b> who said that Eve was a <b>tail, that is</b> why <b>it is written: “And</b> the Lord God <b>built</b> the <i>tzela</i>” (Genesis 2:22); it was a completely new building. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a complete <b>face</b> or side, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And He built”?</b> What needed to be built? |
| Genesis 2:22 | “And brought her unto the man” | Berakhot 61a:19 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And brought her unto the man”</b> (Genesis 2:22), <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said:</b> This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was Adam the first</b> man’s <b>best man. From here, the Torah taught that it is a desired mode of behavior for a greater individual to seek out a lesser individual to</b> assist him and <b>serve as his best man.</b> The greater individual should help the lesser <b>and should not feel badly</b> about it, that it might be beneath his dignity. |
| Genesis 2:22 | He made | Berakhot 61a:6 | It is stated: <b>“And the <i>tzela</i> which the Lord, God,</b> had taken from the man, <b>He made</b> a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). |
| Genesis 3:7 | they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves | Berakhot 40a:14 | We learned in the mishna: One who recited: Who creates fruit of the tree, <b>over fruits of the earth,</b> did not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious,</b> as fruits of the earth do not fall under the rubric of trees. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This ruling in the mishna <b>is only necessary according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> in another context that <b>wheat is a type of tree, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The tree from which Adam, the first</b> man, <b>ate, Rabbi Meir says: It was a vine, as nothing brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon man</b> even today <b>other than wine,</b> as <b>it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And he drank from the wine and became drunk”</b> (Genesis 9:21). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: It was a fig</b> tree, <b>as with the object with which they were corrupted</b> and sinned <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7). They must have taken the leaves from the tree closest at hand, the Tree of Knowledge. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It was wheat, as,</b> even today, <b>the child does not know how to call</b> his <b>father and mother until he tastes the taste of grain.</b> |
| Genesis 3:19 | Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Genesis 4:7 | is like a type of wheat, as it is stated: “Transgression [ ḥatat ] couches at the door” | Berakhot 61a:27 | <b>Rav said: The evil inclination is like a fly and it sits between the two entrances of the heart, as it is stated: “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:1). <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The evil inclination <b>is like a type of wheat, as it is stated: “Transgression [<i>ḥatat</i>] couches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7); <i>ḥatat</i> is interpreted homiletically as related to <i>ḥitta</i>, wheat. |
| Genesis 5:2 | it is written: “Male and female, He created them” | Berakhot 61a:14 | <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>face, that is</b> why <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b> The Gemara answers: It can be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu.</b> As <b>Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,” and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “For in the image of God He made man”</b> (Genesis 9:6), indicating that man was created alone. <b>How, then,</b> does he resolve the contradiction? <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 7:23 | the punishment of the flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, | Berakhot 61a:11 | <b>Rather,</b> this refers to <b>the punishment of the flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,</b> creeping things and fowl of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23); the punishment <b>began with man, then the animals,</b> and ultimately all the other creatures. |
| Genesis 9:6 | it is written: “For in the image of God He made man” | Berakhot 61a:14 | <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>face, that is</b> why <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b> The Gemara answers: It can be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu.</b> As <b>Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,” and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “For in the image of God He made man”</b> (Genesis 9:6), indicating that man was created alone. <b>How, then,</b> does he resolve the contradiction? <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 9:21 | “And he drank from the wine and became drunk” | Berakhot 40a:14 | We learned in the mishna: One who recited: Who creates fruit of the tree, <b>over fruits of the earth,</b> did not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious,</b> as fruits of the earth do not fall under the rubric of trees. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This ruling in the mishna <b>is only necessary according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> in another context that <b>wheat is a type of tree, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The tree from which Adam, the first</b> man, <b>ate, Rabbi Meir says: It was a vine, as nothing brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon man</b> even today <b>other than wine,</b> as <b>it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And he drank from the wine and became drunk”</b> (Genesis 9:21). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: It was a fig</b> tree, <b>as with the object with which they were corrupted</b> and sinned <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7). They must have taken the leaves from the tree closest at hand, the Tree of Knowledge. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It was wheat, as,</b> even today, <b>the child does not know how to call</b> his <b>father and mother until he tastes the taste of grain.</b> |
| Genesis 9:23 | “And their father’s nakedness they did not see” | Berakhot 25b:11 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: Opposite a naked gentile, it is forbidden to recite <i>Shema</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why did</b> Rav Yehuda discuss <b>particularly</b> the case of <b>a gentile? Even with regard to a Jew</b> it is <b>also</b> prohibited. The Gemara replies: Opposite the nakedness of <b>a Jew, it is obvious</b> that it is <b>prohibited; however,</b> opposite the nakedness of <b>a gentile, it was necessary for him</b> to say. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>since it is written about</b> gentiles: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20), <b>say</b> that his nakedness <b>is like</b> that of <b>a mere donkey</b> and does not constitute nakedness. Rav Yehuda <b>taught us that their</b> nakedness <b>is also considered nakedness, as it is written</b> regarding the sons of Noah: <b>“And their father’s nakedness they did not see”</b> (Genesis 9:23). Although Noah predated Abraham and was consequently not Jewish, his nakedness is mentioned. |
| Genesis 12:3 | A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you” | Berakhot 55a:8 | The Gemara details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the <b>Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written</b> of the Torah: <b>“It is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who conducts himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,</b> as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? <b>Because he conducted himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority,</b> and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died. |
| Genesis 15:8 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From the day that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world there was no person who called him “Lord” until Abraham came and called him Lord. As it is stated: “And he said, ‘My Lord, God, by what shall I know that I will inherit it?’” | Berakhot 7b:1 | Until now, the Gemara has cited statements made by Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of the <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yosei. Now, the Gemara begins to cite what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From the day that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world there was no person who called him “Lord” until Abraham came and called him Lord. As it is stated: “And he said, ‘My Lord, God, by what shall I know that I will inherit it?’”</b> (Genesis 15:8). |
| Genesis 15:15 | Go in peace, as it is stated: “But you shall go to your fathers in peace” | Berakhot 64a:10 | <b>Rabbi Avin HaLevi also said: One who takes leave from a dead person should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather,</b> one should say: <b>Go in peace, as it is stated: “But you shall go to your fathers in peace”</b> (Genesis 15:15). |
| Genesis 17:5 | he became the father of the entire world, | Berakhot 13a:5 | The Gemara explains: <b>Initially he became a father,</b> a minister, and prominent person, only <b>to Aram,</b> so he was called Abram, father [av] of Aram, <b>and ultimately</b> with God’s blessing <b>he became the father of the entire world,</b> so he was called Abraham, father of the masses [<i>av hamon</i>], as it is stated: “I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5). |
| Genesis 17:5 | bar Kappara taught: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name will be Abraham” | Berakhot 13a:8 | Also, with regard to Abraham’s name, <b>bar Kappara taught: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name will be Abraham”</b> (Genesis 17:5). This is a positive mitzva to refer to him as Abraham. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One who calls Abraham Abram <b>transgresses a negative mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name shall no longer be called Abram,</b> and your name will be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5). |
| Genesis 17:15 | your wife Sarai, you shall not call her name Sarai; rather, Sarah is her name” | Berakhot 13a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> in the case of Sarah, it is not a general mitzva, rather <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham</b> alone: “And God said to Abraham, <b>your wife Sarai, you shall not call her name Sarai; rather, Sarah is her name”</b> (Genesis 17:15). In contrast, this is stated regarding Abraham in general terms: “Your name shall no longer be called Abram.” |
| Genesis 18:1 | says: “In the heat of the day” | Berakhot 27a:10 | The <i>baraita </i>continues: Do <b>you say</b> that the time when the sun grew hot was <b>at four hours, or</b> perhaps <b>it was only at six hours</b> of the day? <b>When</b> the verse <b>says: “In the heat of the day”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>six hours is</b> already <b>mentioned</b> in the Torah as the heat of the day. <b>How, then, do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“And when the sun grew hot it melted”?</b> This must refer to an earlier time, <b>at four hours.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> of this mishna? It is <b>neither Rabbi Yehuda nor the Sages. If</b> it was in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, until four hours is also</b> considered <b>morning,</b> as he holds that the daily morning offering may still be sacrificed then, while here it says that in the morning the manna was gathered and it melted after the morning. <b>If</b> it was in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, until noon is also</b> considered <b>morning,</b> since, according to the Sages, the daily morning offering could be sacrificed until noon. Apparently, this is an entirely new position. |
| Genesis 19:26 | Lot’s wife, as it is stated: “But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt” | Berakhot 54b:8 | <b>And</b> one must recite a blessing upon seeing <b>Lot’s wife, as it is stated: “But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt”</b> (Genesis 19:26). <b>And the wall of Jericho that was swallowed, as it is written: “And the wall fell down flat”</b> (Joshua 6:20). |
| Genesis 19:27 | “And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood | Berakhot 26b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: Abraham instituted the morning prayer, as it is stated</b> when Abraham came to look out over Sodom the day after he had prayed on its behalf: <b>“And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before the Lord” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> from the context as well as the language utilized in the verse, the verb <b>standing</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer,</b> as this language is used to describe Pinehas’ prayer after the plague, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood up and prayed</b> and the plague ended” (Psalms 106:30). Clearly, Abraham was accustomed to stand in prayer in the morning. |
| Genesis 19:27 | As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood | Berakhot 6b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that Abraham our father set a fixed place</b> for his prayer? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before God” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> the verb <b>“standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed”</b> (Psalms 106:30). |
| Genesis 19:29 | remembers the righteous, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt” | Berakhot 54b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches that for all of these one must give <b>thanks and</b> offer <b>praise?</b> The Gemara answers: The language of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended <b>and teach: Over Lot and his wife one recites two blessings. Over his wife he recites: Blessed…the true Judge, and on Lot he recites: Blessed…Who remembers the righteous.</b> As <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> From the story of Lot it is possible to learn that <b>even during a time of wrath of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> He <b>remembers the righteous, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt”</b> (Genesis 19:29). |
| Genesis 22:8 | “God will provide [ yireh ] Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering” | Berakhot 62b:15 | <b>Rav said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>the patriarch, Jacob,</b> about whom the term seeing is used: <b>“And Jacob said when he saw them [<i>ra’am</i>]:</b> This is God’s camp” (Genesis 32:3). <b>And Shmuel said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>Isaac’s ashes, as it is said</b> in the portion of the binding of Isaac: <b>“God will provide [<i>yireh</i>] Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering”</b> (Genesis 22:8). |
| Genesis 22:14 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He saw the Temple, as it is written: “On the mount where the Lord is seen [ yera’e ]” | Berakhot 62b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: He saw the money of atonement</b> that Israel gave when they were counted during the Exodus from Egypt, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel,</b> and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for your souls” (Exodus 30:16). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He saw the Temple, as it is written: “On the mount where the Lord is seen [<i>yera’e</i>]”</b> (Genesis 22:14). |
| Genesis 22:14 | as it is said to this day: On the mount where the Lord is seen” | Berakhot 62b:17 | Additional <i>amora’im</i>, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, differed</b> in their opinions of what God saw. <b>One said: He saw the money of atonement, and one said: He saw the Temple. And </b>it<b> stands to reason like the one who says </b>that<b> he saw the Temple, as it is stated:</b> “And Abraham called the name of that place: The Lord will see; <b>as it is said to this day: On the mount where the Lord is seen”</b> (Genesis 22:14); generations later, they will recall the initial revelation on Mount Moria, as the angel also appeared to David on this mountain. |
| Genesis 23:3 | as if he is laid out before him, as it is stated: “And Abraham rose up from before his dead” | Berakhot 18a:3 | <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, from</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah.</b> This is an apparent contradiction of our mishna which states that one is exempt only when the deceased is laid before him. To resolve this contradiction, <b>Rav Pappa said: Explain</b> the <i>baraita</i> as applicable only to the particular case when <b>one turns his face</b> away <b>and eats,</b> with the deceased laid out before him. In the other cases, when he is in a different room, he is obligated in all mitzvot. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The phrase: The deceased is laid out before him, is not to be taken literally, but rather, <b>since it is incumbent upon him to bury the deceased,</b> and he is not yet buried, it is <b>as if he is laid out before him, as it is stated: “And Abraham rose up from before his dead”</b> (Genesis 23:3), <b>and</b> when Abraham speaks with the Hittites, <b>it is stated: “So that I may bury my dead from before me”</b> (Genesis 23:4). <b>As long as it is incumbent upon him to bury him,</b> it is <b>as he is laid out before him.</b> |
| Genesis 23:4 | it is stated: “So that I may bury my dead from before me” | Berakhot 18a:3 | <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, from</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah.</b> This is an apparent contradiction of our mishna which states that one is exempt only when the deceased is laid before him. To resolve this contradiction, <b>Rav Pappa said: Explain</b> the <i>baraita</i> as applicable only to the particular case when <b>one turns his face</b> away <b>and eats,</b> with the deceased laid out before him. In the other cases, when he is in a different room, he is obligated in all mitzvot. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The phrase: The deceased is laid out before him, is not to be taken literally, but rather, <b>since it is incumbent upon him to bury the deceased,</b> and he is not yet buried, it is <b>as if he is laid out before him, as it is stated: “And Abraham rose up from before his dead”</b> (Genesis 23:3), <b>and</b> when Abraham speaks with the Hittites, <b>it is stated: “So that I may bury my dead from before me”</b> (Genesis 23:4). <b>As long as it is incumbent upon him to bury him,</b> it is <b>as he is laid out before him.</b> |
| Genesis 24:61 | in school, as it is stated: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man” | Berakhot 61a:24 | <b>Rav Ashi said: And according to what Rav Naḥman said,</b> that <b>Manoah was an ignoramus; he did not even</b> learn to <b>read</b> the basic Torah stories that even children learn <b>in school, as it is stated: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man”</b> (Genesis 24:61); they followed him and did <b>not</b> walk <b>before the man.</b> |
| Genesis 24:63 | Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [ lasuaḥ ] in the field toward evening” | Berakhot 26b:6 | <b>Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [<i>lasuaḥ</i>] in the field toward evening”</b> (Genesis 24:63), <b>and conversation</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [<i>siḥo</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Psalms 102:1). Obviously, Isaac was the first to pray as evening approached, at the time of the afternoon prayer. |
| Genesis 25:23 | Is that really so? Is it not written: “And the Lord said unto her: Two nations [ goyim ] are in your womb” | Berakhot 57b:17 | It was <b>taught</b> in the <b>school of Rabbi Yishmael: Why are they called cucumbers [<i>kishu’im</i>]? Because they are as harmful [<i>kashim</i>] to the body as swords.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that really so? Is it not written: “And the Lord said unto her: Two nations [<i>goyim</i>] are in your womb”</b> (Genesis 25:23) and the Gemara says: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>goyim</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>gayim</i>, proud ones. And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This verse was fulfilled in <b>these</b> two great individuals who descended from Rebecca: <b>Antoninus and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>whose tables,</b> because of their wealth, <b>never lacked for radish, lettuce or cucumbers, neither in summer nor in the rainy season.</b> Apparently, cucumbers are good and are even a delicacy of kings. |
| Genesis 25:24 | “And her time to give birth was fulfilled [ vayimle’u ] and there were twins in her belly” | Berakhot 5b:24 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Moreover, his wife will not miscarry.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here: “And whose belly You fill [<i>temaleh</i>] with Your treasure,” and it is written there,</b> concerning Rebecca’s pregnancy: <b>“And her time to give birth was fulfilled [<i>vayimle’u</i>] and there were twins in her belly”</b> (Genesis 25:24), consequently: You fill with Your treasure refers to a pregnancy that proceeds without complication. |
| Genesis 25:33 | as it is written: “And he sold his birthright to Jacob” | Berakhot 7b:6 | Tangential to the mention of Leah’s son, Judah, and the reason for his name, the Gemara explains the sources for other names, including <b>Reuben. Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Reuben’s name should be considered a prophecy by Leah, as <b>Leah said: See [<i>re’u</i>] the difference between my son [<i>beni</i>] and the son of my father-in-law,</b> Esau, son of Isaac. <b>Even though</b> Esau <b>knowingly sold his birthright</b> to his brother Jacob, <b>as it is written: “And he sold his birthright to Jacob”</b> (Genesis 25:33), nonetheless, <b>behold what is written</b> about <b>him: “And Esau hated Jacob”</b> (Genesis 27:41). |
| Genesis 26:19 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water” | Berakhot 56b:7 | The Gemara continues dealing with interpretations of the details of dreams: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water”</b> (Genesis 26:19), and ultimately there was peace. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One who sees a well in his dream it is a symbol that <b>he has found Torah,</b> as the well symbolizes Torah. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“For whoever finds me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35), <b>and it is written here: “A well of living water,”</b> and we see that a well is linked to Torah as both are associated with life. <b>Rava said:</b> The well in the dream symbolizes <b>actual life.</b> |
| Genesis 27:36 | as it is written: “And he said, ‘Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me twice? | Berakhot 7b:7 | Esau was not only angry over Isaac’s blessing, but he was angry about another matter as well, <b>as it is written: “And he said, ‘Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me twice?</b> He took my birthright, and behold, now he has taken my blessing’” (Genesis 27:36). Despite having sold his birthright, he refused to relinquish it. |
| Genesis 27:41 | him: “And Esau hated Jacob” | Berakhot 7b:6 | Tangential to the mention of Leah’s son, Judah, and the reason for his name, the Gemara explains the sources for other names, including <b>Reuben.

| Genesis 28:11 | Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “And he encountered [ vayifga ] the place and he slept there | Berakhot 26b:7 | <b>Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “And he encountered [<i>vayifga</i>] the place and he slept there</b> for the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). The word <b>encounter</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated</b> when God spoke to Jeremiah: <b>“And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [<i>tifga</i>] Me</b> for I do not hear you” (Jeremiah 7:16). Jacob prayed during the evening, after the sun had set. |
| Genesis 28:15 | “Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go” | Berakhot 4a:16 | The Gemara cites a proof that there is room for one to fear lest he commit a transgression in the future <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, as Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> that God told Jacob in his vision of the ladder: <b>“Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), yet when Jacob returned to Canaan and realized that Esau was coming to greet him, <b>it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid,</b> and he was pained” (Genesis 32:8). Why did Jacob not rely on God’s promise? Jacob had concerns and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Lest a transgression</b> that I might have committed after God made His promise to me <b>will cause</b> God to revoke His promise of protection. |
| Genesis 29:35 | ‘This time I will give thanks to God,’ | Berakhot 7b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From the day the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world, no one thanked the Holy One, Blessed be He, until Leah came and thanked Him, as it is stated:</b> “And she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and she said, <b>‘This time I will give thanks to God,’</b> and thus he was called Judah” (Genesis 29:35). |
| Genesis 30:21 | “And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dina” | Berakhot 60a:12 | <b>Is a prayer</b> in that case <b>ineffective? Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated: <b>“And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dina”</b> (Genesis 30:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the addition of the word: <b>Afterwards?</b> What does the verse seek to convey by emphasizing that after the birth of Zebulun she gave birth to Dina? <b>Rav said: After Leah passed judgment on herself and said: Twelve tribes are destined to descend from Jacob, six came from me and four from the maidservants, that is ten,</b> and <b>if this</b> fetus <b>is male, my sister</b> Rachel <b>will not</b> even <b>be</b> the equivalent <b>of one the maidservants; immediately</b> the fetus <b>was transformed into a daughter, as it is stated: And she called her name Dina;</b> meaning she named her after her judgment [din]. The Gemara rejects this: <b>One does not mention miraculous acts</b> to teach general <i>halakha</i>. |
| Genesis 30:27 | “The Lord has blessed me because of you” | Berakhot 42a:8 | <b>Abaye said</b> that on a similar note, <b>we too will say: Immediately</b> following the entrance of <b>Torah scholars</b> into a house, a <b>blessing</b> rests upon that house, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Laban and Jacob: <b>“The Lord has blessed me because of you”</b> (Genesis 30:27). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead, that the proof is <b>from here, as it is stated:</b> “And it was from when he placed him in charge of his house and over all that he owned, <b>the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph”</b> (Genesis 39:5). |
| Genesis 31:4 | “And Jacob sent and he called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock” | Berakhot 8b:14 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> From <b>what verse</b> is this derived? From the verse, <b>“And Jacob sent and he called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock”</b> (Genesis 31:4); it was only there in the field that he held counsel with them. |
| Genesis 32:3 | “And Jacob said when he saw them [ ra’am ]: | Berakhot 62b:15 | <b>Rav said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>the patriarch, Jacob,</b> about whom the term seeing is used: <b>“And Jacob said when he saw them [<i>ra’am</i>]:</b> This is God’s camp” (Genesis 32:3). <b>And Shmuel said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>Isaac’s ashes, as it is said</b> in the portion of the binding of Isaac: <b>“God will provide [<i>yireh</i>] Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering”</b> (Genesis 22:8). |
| Genesis 32:8 | it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid, | Berakhot 4a:16 | The Gemara cites a proof that there is room for one to fear lest he commit a transgression in the future <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, as Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> that God told Jacob in his vision of the ladder: <b>“Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), yet when Jacob returned to Canaan and realized that Esau was coming to greet him, <b>it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid,</b> and he was pained” (Genesis 32:8).

| Genesis 32:29 | But if that is so, one who calls Jacob Jacob, | Berakhot 13a:11 | Again, the Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so, one who calls Jacob Jacob,</b> about whom it is written: “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel” (Genesis 32:29), <b>also</b> transgresses a mitzva. |
| Genesis 35:10 | “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob; rather, Israel will be your name” | Berakhot 12b:28 | <b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say:</b> The meaning of the expressions: It will not say, and they will no longer mention, are not absolute, as in the verse: <b>“Your name shall no longer be called Jacob; rather, Israel will be your name”</b> (Genesis 35:10).

| Genesis 37:2 | “These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, | Berakhot 55b:2 | From the same source, <b>Rabbi Levi said: One should always anticipate</b> fulfillment of a <b>good dream up to twenty-two years</b> after the dream. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Joseph, as it is written</b> in the story of Joseph’s dream: <b>“These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old,</b> was feeding the flock with his brethren” (Genesis 37:2); <b>and it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh</b> King of Egypt” (Genesis 41:46). <b>From seventeen to thirty how many</b> years <b>are they? Thirteen; and</b> add <b>seven years of plenty and two of famine;</b> the total is <b>twenty-two</b> and only then was the dream fulfilled when his brothers came and bowed down to him. |
| Genesis 37:10 | “Shall we, I and your mother and your brothers, come and bow down [ lehishtaḥavot ] to you to the ground?” | Berakhot 34b:3 | Having mentioned Solomon bowing, the Gemara distinguishes between various types of bowing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> means bowing <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face,</b> with his face toward the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means bowing <b>upon one’s knees, as</b> regarding Solomon <b>it is stated:</b> He finished praying and <b>“he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling [<i>mikkeroa</i>] upon his knees.”</b> Finally, <b><i>hishtaḥava’a</i>, that is</b> bowing with <b>one’s hands and legs spread</b> in total submission, <b>as it is stated</b> in Jacob’s question to Joseph in response to his dream: <b>“Shall we, I and your mother and your brothers, come and bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground?”</b> (Genesis 37:10). |
| Genesis 37:21 | “And Reuben heard and he saved him from their hands, | Berakhot 7b:8 | <b>While my son,</b> Reuben, <b>even though Joseph took his birthright from him by force, as it is written:</b> “And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; <b>but, since he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph,</b> son of Israel” (I Chronicles 5:1). <b>Nevertheless, he was not jealous of him, as it is written</b> when Joseph’s brothers sought to kill him: <b>“And Reuben heard and he saved him from their hands,</b> saying ‘Let us not take his life’” (Genesis 37:21). |
| Genesis 38:25 | as it is stated: “As she was brought forth, | Berakhot 43b:8 | <b>And Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said; and some say Rav Ḥana bar Bizna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said; and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is preferable,</b> from an ethical perspective, <b>for one to throw himself into a fiery furnace rather than humiliate another in public.

Despite her dire situation, she did not reveal that she was pregnant with Judah’s child; rather, she left the decision to him, to avoid humiliating him in public. |
| Genesis 39:5 | the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph” | Berakhot 42a:8 | <b>Abaye said</b> that on a similar note, <b>we too will say: Immediately</b> following the entrance of <b>Torah scholars</b> into a house, a <b>blessing</b> rests upon that house, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Laban and Jacob: <b>“The Lord has blessed me because of you”</b> (Genesis 30:27). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead, that the proof is <b>from here, as it is stated:</b> “And it was from when he placed him in charge of his house and over all that he owned, <b>the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph”</b> (Genesis 39:5). |
| Genesis 40:16 | “The baker saw | Berakhot 55b:18 | With regard to Joseph’s interpretation of these dreams, the Gemara asks, it is written: <b>“The baker saw</b> that the interpretation was good” (Genesis 40:16); <b>from where did</b> the baker <b>know</b> that the interpretation was good? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that each</b> of them <b>was shown his dream and the interpretation of the other’s dream.</b> That is how he knew that it was the correct interpretation. |
| Genesis 41:12 | “Each man according to his dream he did interpret” | Berakhot 55b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all dreams follow the mouth is a verse</b> cited as corroboration? The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that all dreams follow the mouth</b> of the interpreter? <b>As it is stated</b> in the story of the dreams of Pharaoh’s two ministers. The butler said to Pharaoh: <b>“And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was”</b> (Genesis 41:13). <b>Rava said,</b> one must attach a caveat to this: <b>This is only</b> in a case where <b>it is interpreted for him</b> in a manner <b>akin to the dream,</b> where the interpretation is relevant to the dream, <b>as it is stated</b> in the story of Joseph’s interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh’s two ministers: <b>“Each man according to his dream he did interpret”</b> (Genesis 41:12). |
| Genesis 41:13 | “And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was” | Berakhot 55b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all dreams follow the mouth is a verse</b> cited as corroboration?

| Genesis 41:46 | and it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh | Berakhot 55b:2 | From the same source, <b>Rabbi Levi said: One should always anticipate</b> fulfillment of a <b>good dream up to twenty-two years</b> after the dream. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Joseph, as it is written</b> in the story of Joseph’s dream: <b>“These are the generations of Jacob.

| Genesis 46:2 | “And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob, | Berakhot 13a:12 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse reverts back</b> and God Himself refers to Jacob as Jacob, <b>as it is written</b> before his descent to Egypt: <b>“And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob,</b> and he said, ‘Here I am’” (Genesis 46:2). |
| Genesis 47:6 | as it is stated: “And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle” | Berakhot 63b:22 | <b>Rabbi Yosei began</b> to speak <b>in honor of the hosts, and taught:</b> It is said: <b>“You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as the Egyptians, who only befriended Israel,</b> even when they hosted them, <b>for their own benefit,</b> as Pharaoh said to Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle”</b> (Genesis 47:6), are treated <b>this way, all the more so</b> should <b>one who hosts a Torah scholar in his home, providing him with food and drink and availing him of his possessions</b> without concern for personal gain, be treated this way. |

| Genesis 48:16 | “And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth” | Berakhot 55b:12 | <b>Another began and said: One who enters a city and fears the evil eye</b> should <b>hold the thumb [<i>zekafa</i>] of his right hand in his left hand and the thumb of his left hand in his right hand and recite the following: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, come from the descendants of Joseph,</b> over whom <b>the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>];</b> its branches run over the wall” (Genesis 49:22). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>alei ayin</i>; but rather,</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>, who rise above the eye</b> and the evil eye has no dominion over him. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Derive it <b>from here,</b> from what is stated in Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons: <b>“And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16): <b>Just as fish in the sea are covered by water and the evil eye has no dominion over them</b> as they cannot be seen, <b>so too the offspring of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.

| Genesis 49:11 | should anticipate the Messiah, as it is stated: “Binding his foal unto the vine and his donkey’s colt unto the vine branch” | Berakhot 57a:6 | <b>One who sees a vine laden</b> with grapes <b>in a dream,</b> it is an omen that <b>his wife will not miscarry, as it is stated: “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine,</b> in the innermost parts of your house” (Psalms 128:3).

| Genesis 49:22 | not fear the evil eye? He said to them: I descend from the seed of Joseph over whom the evil eye has no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a bountiful vine, a bountiful vine on a spring [ alei ayin ]” | Berakhot 20a:7 | Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was accustomed to go and sit</b> at <b>the gates of the</b> women’s <b>immersion</b> sites. Rabbi Yoḥanan, who was known for his extraordinary good looks, explained this and <b>said: When the daughters of Israel emerge from their immersion, they will look at me, and will have children as beautiful as I.

He said to them: I descend from the seed of Joseph over whom the evil eye has no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a bountiful vine, a bountiful vine on a spring [<i>alei ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22). “<i>Ayin</i>” can mean both “spring” and “eye.” <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said</b> a homiletic interpretation: <b>Do not read</b> it <b><i>alei ayin</i>, rather <i>olei ayin</i>,</b> above the eye; they transcend the influence of the evil eye. |
| Genesis 49:22 | the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [ alei ayin ]; | Berakhot 55b:12 | <b>Another began and said: One who enters a city and fears the evil eye</b> should <b>hold the thumb [<i>zekafa</i>] of his right hand in his left hand and the thumb of his left hand in his right hand and recite the following: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, come from the descendants of Joseph,</b> over whom <b>the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>];</b> its branches run over the wall” (Genesis 49:22). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>alei ayin</i>; but rather,</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>, who rise above the eye</b> and the evil eye has no dominion over him. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Derive it <b>from here,</b> from what is stated in Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons: <b>“And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16): <b>Just as fish in the sea are covered by water and the evil eye has no dominion over them</b> as they cannot be seen, <b>so too the offspring of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.

| Exodus 1:6 | superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers, | Berakhot 55a:8 | The Gemara details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the <b>Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written</b> of the Torah: <b>“It is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who conducts himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,</b> as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? <b>Because he conducted himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority,</b> and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died. |
| Exodus 1:7 | “And the children of Israel became numerous and multiplied and were very many, | Berakhot 7a:36 | <b>And Rav Yosef taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Many”</b> means more <b>than 600,000.</b> This is learned through a verbal analogy between the words <b>many</b> and <b>many. It is written here</b> with regard to Reḥaviya’s sons: <b>“Were very many.” And it is written there</b> with regard to the Israelites in Egypt: <b>“And the children of Israel became numerous and multiplied and were very many,</b> and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7). Just as when the children of Israel were in Egypt, very many meant that there were 600,000 of them, so too the descendants of Reḥaviya were 600,000. |
| Exodus 3:5 | a shoe, which is generally not considered contemptuous, the Torah said: “Put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place upon which you stand is holy ground” | Berakhot 62b:23 | Rava <b>said to him:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i> derives</b> the prohibition of spitting <b>from</b> the case of <b>a shoe, and you say</b> that it should be derived <b>from</b> the case of <b>a shortcut?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is this</b> derivation from the case of a shoe? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may neither enter the Temple Mount with his staff in his hand, nor with his shoes on his feet, nor with money tied in his cloth and with his money-belt slung behind him, nor</b> should one <b>make it a shortcut.

| Exodus 3:6 | you did not want | Berakhot 7a:30 | The Gemara continues to cite the Sages’ explanation of verses that require clarification on the same topic. With regard to God’s statement to Moses, <b>“And He said: ‘You cannot see My face,</b> for man shall not see Me and live’” (Exodus 33:20), <b>it was taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses <b>as follows: When I wanted</b> to show you My glory at the burning bush, <b>you did not want</b> to see it, as it is stated: “And Moses concealed his face, fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6). But <b>now that you want</b> to see My glory, as you said: “Show me Your glory,” <b>I do not want</b> to show it to you. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa interprets Moses’ initial refusal to look upon God’s glory negatively, as he rebuffed God’s desire to be close to him. |
| Exodus 3:6 | concealed his face, | Berakhot 7a:32 | Because “Moses <b>concealed his face,</b> fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6), <b>he was privileged to</b> have his <b>countenance [<i>kelaster</i>]</b> glow. <br>Because <b>he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him”</b> (Exodus 34:30). <br>Because he did not <b>“gaze,” he was privileged to “behold the likeness of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 12:8). |
| Exodus 3:14 | ‘I will be that I will be,’ | Berakhot 9b:6 | The Gemara proceeds to discuss the promise of redemption from Egypt that God made to Moses at the burning bush. When Moses asked God what to say when Israel asks him God’s name, “and God said to Moses: <b>‘I will be that I will be,’</b> and He said: ‘Thus you will say unto the children of Israel: I will be has sent me to you’” (Exodus 3:14). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, told</b> Moses <b>to go and tell Israel: I was with you in this enslavement,</b> and in this redemption, <b>and I will be with you in the enslavement of the kingdoms</b> in the future. |
| Exodus 4:18 | Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace” | Berakhot 64a:9 | <b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who takes leave from another should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather,</b> he should say: <b>Go to peace. As we see</b> that, on the one hand, <b>Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace”</b> (Exodus 4:18), and <b>Moses ascended and was successful.</b> On the other hand, <b>David said to</b> his son, <b>Absalom: “Go in peace”</b> (II Samuel 15:9), and Absalom <b>went and was</b> ultimately <b>hanged.</b> |
| Exodus 6:7 | who is bringing you forth [ hamotzi ] from under the burdens of Egypt” | Berakhot 38a:14 | We learned in the mishna <b>that over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What does</b> one who eats bread <b>recite</b> before eating? <b>Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that the blessing is phrased: <b>Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rava said: Everyone agrees that</b> the term <b><i>motzi</i> means brought,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “God who brought them forth [<i>motziam</i>] from Egypt</b> is for them like the horns of the wild ox” (Numbers 23:22). <b>When do they disagree? With regard to</b> the term <b><i>hamotzi</i>, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brought forth,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “Who brought forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] for you water from a rock of flint”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the term <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brings forth</b> in the present tense, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am the Lord your God <b>who is bringing you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, <i>hamotzi</i> is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past. |
| Exodus 9:33 | the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth” | Berakhot 54b:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in the midrash: They are the <b>stones that</b> remained <b>suspended</b> in the air and did not fall <b>because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>] and they fell down because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They</b> remained <b>suspended because of a man; that is Moses,</b> whom the verse refers to as a man, <b>as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest”</b> (Numbers 12:3), <b>and it is written:</b> “And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the Lord; <b>the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth”</b> (Exodus 9:33). Moses’ hailstones remained suspended. And the stones <b>descended because of a man; that is Joshua,</b> who was also called man, <b>as it is written: “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit”</b> (Numbers 27:18). <b>And it is written</b> that when Joshua and his people waged war against the army of the Emorite kings, God told him not to fear them because God would deliver them into his hands; and indeed, they died by means of these stones: <b>“As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beit Ḥoron, that the Lord cast down great stones</b> from heaven upon them unto Azeka, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew by sword” (Joshua 10:11). |
| Exodus 11:2 | “Speak, please [ na ] in the ears of the people, | Berakhot 9a:29 | Since the last topic discussed in the Gemara revolved around the exodus from Egypt, the Gemara cites additional aggadic midrash on that subject. With regard to the verse: <b>“Speak, please [<i>na</i>] in the ears of the people,</b> and they should borrow, every man from his fellow and every woman from her fellow, silver and gold vessels” (Exodus 11:2), the word please [na] is unclear. The students of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Please</b> [<b><i>na</i>] is nothing more than an expression of supplication.</b> Why would God employ an expression of supplication in approaching Israel? The Gemara explains that the <b>Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses</b>: <b>I beseech you, go and tell Israel: I beseech you; borrow vessels of silver and vessels of gold from the Egyptians</b> in order to fulfill the promise I made to Abraham in the “Covenant between the Pieces,” <b>so that</b> |
| Exodus 11:4 | About midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt” | Berakhot 3b:27 | When King David said: At midnight I rise, the assumption is that he rose precisely at midnight. The Gemara asks: <b>Did David know</b> exactly <b>when it was midnight? Even Moses our teacher did not know</b> exactly when it was midnight. How do we know this about Moses? <b>As it is written</b> that he said to Pharaoh: “Thus said the Lord: <b>About midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 11:4). The word about indicates that it was only an approximation. |
| Exodus 11:7 | rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue” | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Exodus 12:2 | “This month will be for you the first of the months; | Berakhot 10b:9 | With regard to his intercalation of Nisan, the Gemara asks: <b>Did Hezekiah not</b> accept the <i>halakha</i>: <b>“This month will be for you the first of the months;</b> it shall be the first for you of the months of the year” (Exodus 12:2)? By inference, <b>this</b> first month <b>is Nisan, and no other</b> month <b>is Nisan.</b> How could Hezekiah add an additional Nisan in violation of Torah law? |
| Exodus 12:8 | “And they shall eat of the meat on that night; | Berakhot 9a:14 | <b>Rav Yosef said: This is not difficult</b> as these two sources reflect two conflicting opinions. <b>This,</b> our mishna, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. While this,</b> the <i>baraita</i>, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb: <b>“And they shall eat of the meat on that night;</b> roasted over fire and <i>matzot</i> with bitter herbs shall they eat it” (Exodus 12:8); <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Here it is stated: “On that night,”</b> from which we cannot determine when night ends. The same expression is encountered later in the same chapter: <b>“And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from person to animal” (Exodus 12:12). We know when the firstborns were struck down based on the verse “Thus said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). Therefore, <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>below,</b> the striking of the firstborns took place <b>until midnight,</b> as stated explicitly in the verse, <b>so too</b> in the verse <b>here,</b> the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb continues <b>until midnight.</b> |
| Exodus 12:10 | “It should not remain until the morning” | Berakhot 9a:20 | The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>derives</b> this conclusion <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“It should not remain until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:10). If one is prohibited from leaving over any part of the sacrifice until the morning, he is certainly prohibited from leaving it over until the following night. Therefore, it is unnecessary to cite an additional source to teach that the Paschal lamb may only be eaten on the first night. |
| Exodus 12:11 | in haste | Berakhot 9a:15 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: Was it not already said,</b> “Thus you shall eat it, with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staffs in your hands and you will eat it <b>in haste</b> for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11)? Therefore the Paschal lamb may be eaten <b>until the time of haste.</b> Since the time of haste is when Israel left Egypt, and it is said, “You will not leave, every man from his house, until the morning,” then the Paschal lamb may be eaten until dawn. <b>If that is so, why does the verse state: On</b> that <b>night?</b> |
| Exodus 12:11 | with regard to the time of haste, | Berakhot 9a:26 | However, <b>with regard to what did they disagree?</b> They disagreed <b>with regard to the time of haste,</b> as it is written: “You will eat it in haste for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya held: What is</b> the meaning of <b>haste?</b> It is <b>the haste of the Egyptians</b> at midnight, as they hurried to the houses of the people of Israel to send them away, in fear of the plague of the firstborn. |
| Exodus 12:12 | “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night | Berakhot 9a:14 | <b>Rav Yosef said: This is not difficult</b> as these two sources reflect two conflicting opinions. <b>This,</b> our mishna, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.

| Exodus 12:36 | and they gave them what they requested | Berakhot 9b:3 | With regard to the spoils taken from Egypt described in the verse: “And the Lord gave the nation grace in the eyes of Egypt, <b>and they gave them what they requested</b> and they emptied Egypt” (Exodus 12:36), <b>Rabbi Ami said: This teaches that</b> the Egyptians <b>gave them what they requested against their will.</b> There is a dispute with regard to the question: Against whose will? <b>Some say</b> it was given <b>against the will of the Egyptians, and some say</b> it was given <b>against the will of Israel.</b> The proponent of each position cites support for his opinion. |
| Exodus 14:22 | as it is stated: “And the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground | Berakhot 54a:15 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted,</b> the miracles at <b>the crossings of the sea</b> are recorded explicitly in the Torah, <b>as it is stated: “And the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground</b> and the water was a wall for them on their right and on their left” (Exodus 14:22). So too, the miracle at <b>the crossings of the Jordan, as it is stated: “The priests who bore the ark of God’s covenant stood on dry land within the Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry land until the entire nation finished crossing the Jordan”</b> (Joshua 3:17). |
| Exodus 14:31 | Egyptians” | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Exodus 15:17 | You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord, | Berakhot 33a:20 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Great is the Holy Temple, as</b> it too <b>was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The place in which to dwell which <b>You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord,</b> which Your hands have prepared” (Exodus 15:17). |
| Exodus 15:26 | it is said: “And He said, if you will surely listen [ shamo’a tishma ] | Berakhot 40a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Zeira, and some say Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa, said: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood is</b> that <b>an empty vessel holds</b> that which is placed within it, while <b>a full</b> vessel <b>does not hold</b> it. <b>The attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> however, <b>is not so,</b> as if God adds to a person who is <b>a full vessel</b> in terms of knowledge or good attributes, he will <b>hold</b> it; a person who is <b>an empty</b> vessel <b>will not hold</b> it. This is alluded to by the verse where <b>it is said: “And He said, if you will surely listen [<i>shamo’a tishma</i>]</b> to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His eyes” (Exodus 15:26). This verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>If you listen [<i>shamo’a</i>]</b> in the present, <b>you will listen [<i>tishma</i>]</b> in the future as well; <b>and if not, you will not listen. Alternatively: If you listened [<i>shamo’a</i>] to the old,</b> you review what you already learned, then <b>you will listen [<i>tishma</i>] to the new</b> as well.

| Exodus 15:26 | as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer” | Berakhot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren,</b> who learn only the Written Torah, <b>know this</b> concept <b>as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>Rather,</b> one must interpret the verse: <b>Anyone who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>yet does not engage</b> in that study, not only does <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> fail to protect him, but He <b>brings upon him hideous afflictions,</b> that embarrass him <b>and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong”</b> (Psalms 39:3). The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong.” |
| Exodus 16:8 | Lest you say: Since it is written: “When the Lord shall give you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to the full” | Berakhot 20b:7 | We also learned in the mishna that women are obligated to recite the <b>Grace after Meals.</b> The Gemara asks: That too is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since it is written: “When the Lord shall give you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to the full”</b> (Exodus 16:8), one might conclude that the Torah established fixed times for the meals and, consequently, for the mitzva of Grace after Meals and, therefore, it <b>is considered a time-bound, positive mitzva,</b> exempting women from its recitation. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that women are obligated. |
| Exodus 16:21 | and when the sun grew hot it melted” | Berakhot 27a:9 | <b>And about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours.</b> Based on this, the Gemara attempts to identify <b>the <i>tanna</i> who taught that which we learned</b> in the mishna about the manna that fell for the children of Israel in the desert: “And they gathered it morning by morning, each according to what he eats, <b>and when the sun grew hot it melted”</b> (Exodus 16:21); that took place <b>four hours</b> into the day. |
| Exodus 16:22 | “Twice as much bread” | Berakhot 39b:9 | In connection to the various <i>halakhot</i> with regard to breaking bread, especially on Festivals, the Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Abba said: And on Shabbat one is obligated to break</b> bread for the meal <b>over two loaves. What is the reason?</b> Because in the Torah portion that discusses gathering manna on Friday for Shabbat, the phrase: <b>“Twice as much bread”</b> (Exodus 16:22) <b>is written.</b> To commemorate this, Shabbat meals are based on two loaves of bread. |

The plural <i>kolot</i> indicates at least two sounds, while “the voice of the shofar” is one more. The passage continues: <b>“And when the voice of the <i>shofar</i></b> grew louder and louder, Moses spoke <b>and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19).

| Exodus 20:5 | where they do not adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own, | Berakhot 7a:27 | The Gemara <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> verse from Exodus, which states that God punishes descendants for the transgressions of their ancestors, refers to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own. While this</b> verse from Deuteronomy, which states that descendants are not punished for the actions of their ancestors, refers to a case <b>where they do not adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own,</b> as it is stated: “I visit iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and fourth generations of my enemies” (Exodus 20:5). |
| Exodus 20:7 | “Do not take | Berakhot 33a:35 | <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> apparently <b>self-contradictory.</b> On the one hand, <b>you said that one who recites <i>havdala</i> in the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> is <b>more praiseworthy than one who recites <i>havdala</i> over the cup</b> of wine, indicating that reciting <i>havdala</i> in <b>the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer alone is sufficient. And then it is taught: If one recited <i>havdala</i> in this,</b> the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>and that,</b> over the cup of wine, <b>may blessings rest upon his head.

From these two variants we can deduce that <b>anyone included in</b> the obligation to <b>observe</b> Shabbat by avoiding its desecration, <b>is</b> also <b>included in</b> the mitzva to <b>remember</b> Shabbat by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>Since these women are included in</b> the mitzva <b>to observe</b> Shabbat, as there is no distinction between men and women in the obligation to observe prohibitions in general and to refrain from the desecration of Shabbat in particular, so too <b>are they included in</b> the mitzva of <b>remembering</b> Shabbat. |
| Exodus 20:15 | Is this so? Isn’t it also written: “And the whole nation saw the voices | Berakhot 6b:31 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Isn’t it also written: “And the whole nation saw the voices</b> and the torches and the sound of the shofar” (Exodus 20:15)? Clearly more than five voices are mentioned with regard to the revelation at Sinai. |
| Exodus 20:21 | the Divine Presence is with him? As it is stated: “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you” | Berakhot 6a:13 | The Gemara returns to Ravin bar Rav Adda’s statement: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that when even one who sits and engages in Torah</b> study, <b>the Divine Presence is with him? As it is stated: “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you”</b> (Exodus 20:21); God blesses even a single person who mentions God’s name, a reference to Torah study (<i>Iyyun Ya’akov</i>). |
| Exodus 21:19 | “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” | Berakhot 60a:29 | <b>Abaye</b> responded and <b>said: One should not say this, as</b> it was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that from the verse, <b>“And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19), <b>from here</b> we derive <b>that permission is granted to a doctor to heal.</b> The practice of medicine is in accordance with the will of God. |
| Exodus 21:28 | in Jerusalem for killing a person, | Berakhot 27a:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified</b> about <b>five matters of</b> <i>halakha</i>: <br>When an orphan girl, who was married off by her mother or brother before reaching the age of majority, reaches the age of majority, she may refuse to continue living with her husband and thereby retroactively annul their marriage. Normally, marriage refusals are discouraged. However, in specific instances where it is clear that if the marriage were to remain in effect it would engender problems related to levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified that <b>one may persuade the minor girl to refuse</b> to continue living with her husband, thereby resolving the complications involved in this case.<br><b>And</b> he testified <b>that one may</b> allow <b>a woman</b> who, after hearing of her husband’s death, seeks to remarry, <b>to marry based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> as opposed to the two witnesses required for other testimonies of the Torah. <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about a rooster that was stoned</b> to death <b>in Jerusalem for killing a person,</b> in order to teach that the Torah law (Exodus 21:28) which requires the stoning of an ox that killed a person, applies to other animals as well. <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about forty-day-old wine that was</b> used for <b>libation on the altar.</b> <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours</b> of the day. |
| Exodus 21:28 | “And if an ox gore a man” | Berakhot 56b:15 | <b>One who sees an ox in a dream,</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “His firstling bullock, majesty is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“And if an ox gore a man”</b> (Exodus 21:28). |
| Exodus 22:17 | ben Azzai says: It is stated: “You shall not allow a sorceress to live” | Berakhot 21b:10 | <b>And from where do we derive</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not derive homiletic interpretations</b> from juxtaposed verses <b>throughout the entire Torah? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the punishment of a sorceress, <b>ben Azzai says: It is stated: “You shall not allow a sorceress to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), although the manner of her execution is not specified, <b>and it is stated: “Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18). The fact that the Torah <b>juxtaposed this matter to that</b> was <b>to say: Just as one who lies with a beast</b> is executed <b>by stoning</b> (see Leviticus 20), <b>so too a sorceress</b> is executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Exodus 22:18 | and it is stated: “Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death” | Berakhot 21b:10 | <b>And from where do we derive</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not derive homiletic interpretations</b> from juxtaposed verses <b>throughout the entire Torah?

| Exodus 23:25 | is not necessary, as it says: “And He will bless your bread and your water” | Berakhot 48b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> That source for the obligation to recite a blessing beforehand <b>is not necessary, as it says: “And He will bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25); <b>do not read: And He will bless [<i>uveirakh</i>], rather: And you will bless [<i>uvareikh</i>]. And when is it called bread? Before it is eaten.</b> |
| Exodus 24:11 | “And they beheld God, and they ate and drank” | Berakhot 17a:12 | <b>Rav was wont to say:</b> <br><b>The World-to-Come is not like this world.</b> <br><b>In the World-to-Come there is no eating, no drinking,</b> <br><b>no procreation, no</b> business <b>negotiations,</b> <br><b>no jealousy, no hatred, and no competition.</b> <br><b>Rather, the righteous sit with their crowns upon their heads, enjoying the splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated:</b> <br><b>“And they beheld God, and they ate and drank”</b> (Exodus 24:11), meaning that beholding God’s countenance is tantamount to eating and drinking. |
| Exodus 24:12 | it says: “And I will give [ ve’etna ] you the stone tablets, and the Torah and the mitzva, | Berakhot 48b:10 | The <i>baraita</i> with regard to Grace after Meals continues: <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for <b>Grace after Meals. From where</b> is the obligation to recite <b>the blessing of the Torah</b> derived? Several answers are offered: <b>Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> It is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference</b> from Grace after Meals: <b>Over</b> food, which is an aspect of <b>temporal life, one recites a blessing, all the more so</b> one recites a blessing over the Torah, which is <b>eternal life. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Naḥmani,</b> the <b>student of Rabbi Yishmael, says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: This</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>is not necessary,</b> as this <i>halakha</i> can be derived from the same verse from which Grace after Meals is derived, <b>as it states: “For the good land that He gave [<i>natan</i>] you,” and below,</b> with regard to the Torah, <b>it says: “And I will give [<i>ve’etna</i>] you the stone tablets, and the Torah and the mitzva,</b> which I have written, that you may teach them” (Exodus 24:12). Here, just as giving with regard to the good land requires a blessing, giving with regard to the Torah requires a blessing. |
| Exodus 24:12 | and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the mitzva that I have written that you may teach them” | Berakhot 5a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> God said to Moses, “Ascend to me on the mountain and be there, <b>and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the mitzva that I have written that you may teach them”</b> (Exodus 24:12), meaning that God revealed to Moses not only the Written Torah, but all of Torah, as it would be transmitted through the generations. <br><b>The “tablets” are the ten commandments</b> that were written on the tablets of the Covenant, <br><b>the “Torah” is the five books of Moses.</b> <br><b>The “mitzva” is the Mishna,</b> which includes explanations for the mitzvot and how they are to be performed. <br><b>“That I have written” refers to the Prophets and Writings,</b> written with divine inspiration. <br><b>“That you may teach them” refers to the Talmud,</b> which explains the Mishna. <br>These explanations are the foundation for the rulings of practical <i>halakha</i>. This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>all</b> aspects of Torah <b>were given to</b> Moses <b>from Sinai.</b> |
| Exodus 27:20 | One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream,</b> and they were <b>small,</b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but,</b> one who sees olive <b>trees,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants,</b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Gemara likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Exodus 30:12 | I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul | Berakhot 62b:11 | As for David’s statement to Saul: <b>“If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering”</b> (I Samuel 26:19), <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: Do you call Me an inciter?</b> In retribution, <b>I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul</b> unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them” (Exodus 30:12). <b>Immediately</b> after God said this to David, <b>“Satan stood up against Israel</b> and incited David to number Israel” (I Chronicles 21:1). Moreover, <b>it is written:</b> “And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, <b>and He incited David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judea”</b> (II Samuel 24:1). The proportional response to David’s calling God an inciter was that He incited David. <b>And when he counted them, he did not take a ransom from them,</b> and he was punished, <b>as it is written: “So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the appointed time”</b> (II Samuel 24:15). |
| Exodus 30:16 | as it is stated: “And you shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, | Berakhot 62b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: He saw the money of atonement</b> that Israel gave when they were counted during the Exodus from Egypt, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel,</b> and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for your souls” (Exodus 30:16). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He saw the Temple, as it is written: “On the mount where the Lord is seen [<i>yera’e</i>]”</b> (Genesis 22:14). |
| Exodus 31:3 | “And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, | Berakhot 55a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Bezalel knew</b> how <b>to join</b> the <b>letters with which heaven and earth were created.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here</b> in praise of Bezalel: <b>“And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</b> and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to creation of heaven and earth: <b>“The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens”</b> (Proverbs 3:19), <b>and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up</b> and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20). We see that wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, the qualities with which the heavens and earth were created, are all found in Bezalel. |
| Exodus 31:6 | “And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed wisdom” | Berakhot 55a:14 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, only grants wisdom to one who</b> already <b>possesses wisdom, as it is stated: “He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to they who know understanding”</b> (Daniel 2:21). <b>Rav Taḥalifa, from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>heard</b> this <b>and repeated it before Rabbi Abbahu.</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: You learned</b> proof for this idea <b>from there; we learn it from here: As it is written</b> in praise of the builders of the Tabernacle: <b>“And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed wisdom”</b> (Exodus 31:6). |
| Exodus 32:7 | “And the Lord said to Moses: Go and descend, | Berakhot 32a:14 | The Gemara elaborates upon additional aspects of the sin of the Golden Calf. It is stated: <b>“And the Lord said to Moses: Go and descend,</b> for your people whom you have lifted out of the land of Egypt have been corrupted” (Exodus 32:7). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“go and descend”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, descend from your greatness. Isn’t it only for the sake of Israel,</b> so that you may serve as an emissary, <b>that I granted you prominence; and now that Israel has sinned, why do I</b> need <b>you?</b> There is no need for an emissary. <b>Immediately, Moses’ strength waned and he was powerless to speak</b> in defense of Israel. <b>And once</b> God <b>said</b> to Moses: <b>“Leave Me be, that I may destroy them”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:14), <b>Moses said</b> to himself: If God is telling me to let Him be, it must be because <b>this matter is dependent upon me. Immediately Moses stood and was strengthened in prayer, and asked</b> that God have <b>mercy</b> on the nation of Israel and forgive them for their transgression. |
| Exodus 32:10 | “Now leave Me be, that My wrath will be enraged against them and I will consume them; and I will make of you a great nation” | Berakhot 32a:16 | In an additional aspect of the sin of the Golden Calf, God told Moses: <b>“Now leave Me be, that My wrath will be enraged against them and I will consume them; and I will make of you a great nation”</b> (Exodus 32:10). Explaining this verse, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it would be impossible to utter</b> it, in deference to God. The phrase: Leave Me be, <b>teaches that Moses grabbed the Holy One, Blessed be He, as a person who grabs his friend by his garment</b> would, <b>and he said before Him: Master of the Universe, I will not leave You be until You forgive and pardon them.</b> |
| Exodus 32:11 | [ titḥolel ] as it is written: “And Moses besought [ vayeḥal ] the Lord” | Berakhot 30b:9 | The Gemara points out that both Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda based their positions on the prayers of Moses. <b>The one who said: So that his mind will be in a pleading</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥonen</i>], as it is written: “And I pleaded [<i>va’etḥanan</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And the one who said: So that his mind will be in a beseeching</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥolel</i>] as it is written: “And Moses besought [<i>vayeḥal</i>] the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11). |
| Exodus 32:11 | “And Moses beseeched [ vayḥal ] before the Lord” | Berakhot 32a:19 | The Torah continues: <b>“And Moses beseeched [<i>vayḥal</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11). Many interpretations were given for this uncommon term, <i>vayḥal</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It <b>teaches that Moses stood in prayer before the Holy One, Blessed be He, until it made him ill [</b><i>heḥelahu</i><b>]</b> from overexertion. <b>And Rava said:</b> Moses stood in prayer <b>until he nullified His vow,</b> as the term <i>vayḥal</i> alludes to nullification of an oath. <b>Here it is written <i>vayḥal</i>, and there</b> referring to vows, <b>it is written: “He shall not nullify [<i>lo yaḥel</i>] his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). <b>And</b> with regard to vows, <b>the Master said: He</b> who vowed <b>cannot nullify</b> his vow, <b>but others,</b> the court, <b>can nullify</b> his vow <b>for him.</b> Here, it is as if Moses nullified the Lord’s vow to destroy Israel. |
| Exodus 32:13 | upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, | Berakhot 10b:12 | The Gemara cites proof from Moses. When he prayed to God for forgiveness after the incident of the Golden Calf, <b>he based</b> his request <b>upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants,</b> to whom You swore upon Yourself, and told them: I will increase your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and all of this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants and they will inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13). Yet when this story is related, God’s forgiveness of Israel <b>is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them”</b> (Psalms 106:23). |
| Exodus 32:13 | “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel Your servants, to whom You swore in Your name” | Berakhot 32a:24 | As Moses continues his prayer, he says: <b>“Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel Your servants, to whom You swore in Your name”</b> (Exodus 32:13). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>in Your name? Rabbi Elazar said: Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, had You sworn to them by the heavens and the earth, I would say: Just as the heavens and the earth will</b> ultimately <b>be no more, so too Your oath will be null and void. Now that You swore to them by Your great name, just as Your name lives and stands for all eternity, so too does Your oath live and stand for all eternity.</b> |
| Exodus 32:32 | as it is stated: “And if not, erase me, please, from Your book” | Berakhot 32a:20 | <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The term <i>vayḥal</i> <b>teaches that</b> Moses <b>gave his life,</b> from the term <i>ḥalal</i>, a dead person, <b>for</b> Israel, <b>as it is stated: “And if not, erase me, please, from Your book”</b> (Exodus 32:32). |
| Exodus 33:7 | “Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, | Berakhot 63b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda, head of the speakers in every place, opened</b> his speech <b>in honor of Torah, and taught:</b> It is stated: <b>“Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp,</b> far off from the camp; and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And it came to pass, that every seeker of God went out unto the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp” (Exodus 33:7). He said: <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference? Just as the Torah says</b> of <b>the ark of God, which was only twelve <i>mil</i> from the camp: “Every seeker of God went out unto the Tent of Meeting”; all the more so</b> should <b>Torah scholars,</b> who wander great distances and <b>go from city to city and country to country to study Torah,</b> be called seekers of God. |
| Exodus 33:11 | “And the Lord spoke unto Moses, face to face” | Berakhot 63b:7 | The Gemara continues: It is stated: <b>“And the Lord spoke unto Moses, face to face”</b> (Exodus 33:11). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, you and I will show cheerful faces in</b> the study of <b><i>halakha</i></b> to those who come to study. <b>Some say</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, told Moses: Just as I showed you a cheerful face, so too you will show Israel a cheerful face and restore the tent to its place</b> in the camp. |
| Exodus 33:11 | “And he would return into the camp; | Berakhot 63b:8 | It is said: <b>“And he would return into the camp;</b> but his minister, Joshua bin-Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent” (Exodus 33:11). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, told Moses: Now,</b> they will say: <b>The Master,</b> God, <b>is angry and</b> the <b>student,</b> Moses, is also <b>angry, and what will happen to Israel?</b> Rather, you must restore the tent to its place among the people. <b>If you restore the tent to its place, fine; and if not, Joshua bin-Nun, your student,</b> will <b>serve</b> as Israel’s leader <b>in your place.</b> |
| Exodus 33:13 | to him, as it is stated: “Show me Your ways | Berakhot 7a:25 | Lastly, Moses <b>requested that the ways</b> in which <b>God</b> conducts the <b>world be revealed to him, and He granted</b> it <b>to him, as it is stated: “Show me Your ways</b> and I will know You” (Exodus 33:13). <br>Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe. Why is it that</b> the <b>righteous prosper, the righteous suffer,</b> the <b>wicked prosper,</b> the <b>wicked suffer?</b> <br>God <b>said to him: Moses, the righteous</b> person <b>who prospers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a righteous</b> person, who is rewarded for the actions of his ancestors. <b>The righteous</b> person <b>who suffers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a wicked</b> person, who is punished for the transgressions of his ancestors. <b>The wicked</b> person <b>who prospers is a wicked</b> person, <b>the son of a righteous</b> person, who is rewarded for the actions of his ancestors. <b>The wicked</b> person <b>who suffers is a wicked person, the son of a wicked person,</b> who is punished for the transgressions of his ancestors. |
| Exodus 33:14 | “My face will go, and I will give you rest” | Berakhot 7a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one must not placate a person while</b> he is in the throes of <b>his anger,</b> rather he should mollify him after he has calmed down? <b>As it is written,</b> when following the sin of the Golden Calf, Moses requested that the Divine Presence rest upon Israel as it had previously, God said to him: <b>“My face will go, and I will give you rest”</b> (Exodus 33:14). Rabbi Yoḥanan explained: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses: <b>Wait until My face of wrath will pass and I will grant your</b> request. One must wait for a person’s anger to pass as well. |
| Exodus 33:14 | his anger? As it is stated: “My face will go, and I will give you rest” | Berakhot 7b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one must not placate a person while</b> the person in the throes of <b>his anger? As it is stated: “My face will go, and I will give you rest”</b> (Exodus 33:14). |
| Exodus 33:16 | Is it not in that You go with us, | Berakhot 7a:23 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei</b> regarding Moses’ request that the Divine Presence rest upon Israel as it once had: Moses <b>requested three things from the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> at that time, <b>all of which were granted him. He requested that the Divine Presence rest upon Israel</b> and not leave, <b>and He granted</b> it <b>to him, as it is stated:</b> “For how can it be known that I have found grace in Your sight, I and Your people? <b>Is it not in that You go with us,</b> so that we are distinguished, I and Your people, from all the people that are on the face of the earth?” (Exodus 33:16). The request: Is it not in that You go with us, refers to the resting of the Divine Presence upon Israel. |
| Exodus 33:16 | to him, as it is stated: “So that we are distinguished, I and Your people, | Berakhot 7a:24 | Moses <b>requested that the Divine Presence not rest upon the nations of the world, and He granted</b> it <b>to him, as it is stated: “So that we are distinguished, I and Your people,</b> from all the people on the face of the earth” (Exodus 33:16). |
| Exodus 33:19 | As it is said: “And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious” | Berakhot 7a:29 | Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, that God granted Moses all three of his requests, <b>disagrees with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir said: Two</b> of Moses’ requests <b>were granted to him, and one was not granted to him.</b> God granted him that the Divine Presence would rest upon Israel and not leave, and that the Divine Presence would not rest upon the nations of the world, but God did not reveal to Moses the ways in which He conducts the world. <b>As it is said: “And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious”</b> (Exodus 33:19); in His mercy, God bestows His grace upon every person, <b>even though he is not worthy.</b> Similarly, God says: <b>“And I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy,” even though he is not worthy.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the way in which God conducts the world and bestows grace and mercy was not revealed even to Moses. |
| Exodus 33:20 | “And He said: ‘You cannot see My face, | Berakhot 7a:30 | The Gemara continues to cite the Sages’ explanation of verses that require clarification on the same topic. With regard to God’s statement to Moses, <b>“And He said: ‘You cannot see My face,</b> for man shall not see Me and live’” (Exodus 33:20), <b>it was taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses <b>as follows: When I wanted</b> to show you My glory at the burning bush, <b>you did not want</b> to see it, as it is stated: “And Moses concealed his face, fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6). But <b>now that you want</b> to see My glory, as you said: “Show me Your glory,” <b>I do not want</b> to show it to you. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa interprets Moses’ initial refusal to look upon God’s glory negatively, as he rebuffed God’s desire to be close to him. |
| Exodus 33:23 | “And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back, | Berakhot 7a:33 | What did Moses see? It is said: <b>“And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back,</b> but My face you will not see” (Exodus 33:23). <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida,</b> the expression: “And you will see My back,” should be understood as follows: <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> Who, as mentioned above, wears phylacteries, <b>showed him the knot of the phylacteries</b> of His head, which is worn on the back of the head. |
| Exodus 34:7 | Isn’t it written: “He visits iniquity of the fathers upon the children, | Berakhot 7a:26 | The Gemara expands upon these righteous and wicked individuals: <b>The Master said: The righteous</b> person <b>who prospers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a righteous</b> person. <b>The righteous</b> person <b>who suffers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a wicked</b> person. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it so</b> that one is always punished for his ancestors’ transgressions? <b>Isn’t it written: “He visits iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</b> and upon the children’s children, unto the third and fourth generations” (Exodus 34:7). <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: “Fathers shall not die for their children, <b>and children shall not be put to death for the fathers;</b> every man shall die for his own transgression” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between the two verses.</b> |
| Exodus 34:30 | he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him” | Berakhot 7a:32 | Because “Moses <b>concealed his face,</b> fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6), <b>he was privileged to</b> have his <b>countenance [<i>kelaster</i>]</b> glow. <br>Because <b>he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him”</b> (Exodus 34:30). <br>Because he did not <b>“gaze,” he was privileged to “behold the likeness of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 12:8). |
| Exodus 35:30 | See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel, | Berakhot 55a:11 | With regard to Bezalel’s appointment, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One may only appoint a leader over a community if he consults with the community</b> and they agree to the appointment, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Moses said unto the children of Israel: <b>See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel,</b> son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah” (Exodus 35:30). <b>The Lord said to Moses: Moses, is Bezalel</b> a <b>suitable</b> appointment in <b>your</b> eyes? Moses <b>said to Him: Master of the universe, if he is</b> a <b>suitable</b> appointment in <b>Your</b> eyes, <b>then all the more so</b> in <b>my</b> eyes. The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to him: Nevertheless, go and tell</b> Israel and ask their opinion. Moses <b>went and said to Israel: Is Bezalel suitable</b> in <b>your</b> eyes? <b>They said to him: If he is suitable</b> in the eyes of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, and</b> in <b>your</b> eyes, <b>all the more so</b> he is suitable in <b>our</b> eyes. |
| Leviticus 2:13 | should not be excluded | Berakhot 5a:19 | <b>And that is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, and</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions.</b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, as it is written: “The salt of the covenant</b> with your God <b>should not be excluded</b> from your meal-offering; with all your sacrifices you must offer salt” (Leviticus 2:13). <b>And</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:69). <b>Just as,</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to salt, the salt sweetens</b> the taste of <b>the meat</b> and renders it edible, <b>so too</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to suffering, the suffering cleanses a person’s transgressions,</b> purifying him for a more sublime existence. |
| Leviticus 6:2 | the burning of fats and limbs | Berakhot 2a:5 | Rabban Gamliel cites several cases in support of his claim, such as <b>the burning of fats and limbs</b> on the altar. Due to the quantity of offerings each day, the priests were often unable to complete the burning of all of the fats and limbs, so they continued to be burned into the night, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain upon the pyre on the altar all night until morning, while the fire on the altar burns it” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings <b>that are eaten for one day</b> and night; although the Sages state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten <b>until dawn.</b> This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If so, why did the Sages say</b> that they may be eaten only <b>until midnight?</b> This is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression,</b> as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed. |

| Leviticus 10:12 | honor, one begins with the greatest, as it is written: “And Moses said unto Aaron, and Elazar and Itamar, his remaining sons: Take | Berakhot 61a:10 | The Gemara explains: <b>In</b> conferring <b>honor, one begins with the greatest, as it is written: “And Moses said unto Aaron, and Elazar and Itamar, his remaining sons: Take</b> the meal-offering that remains” (Leviticus 10:12). Aaron, who was the greatest among those involved, is mentioned first. And <b>in cursing, one begins with the least significant,</b> as <b>first</b> the <b>snake was cursed, then Eve was cursed, and ultimately Adam</b> himself <b>was cursed.</b> The punishment did not begin with Adam. |
| Leviticus 12:2 | woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male, as it is stated: “When a woman emitted seed and bore a male” | Berakhot 60a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is prayer effective</b> for that purpose? <b>Didn’t Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Ami, say:</b> The tradition teaches that the gender of the fetus is determined at the moment of conception. If the <b>man emits seed first,</b> his wife <b>gives birth to a female;</b> if the <b>woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male, as it is stated: “When a woman emitted seed and bore a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a case where they both emit seed simultaneously.</b> In that case, the gender is undetermined and prayer may be effectual. |
| Leviticus 13:46 | it is written: “He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his dwelling be” | Berakhot 25a:11 | <b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> in the case of leprosy, <b>it is contingent upon the permanence</b> of the place, <b>as</b> with regard to the leper <b>it is written: “He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his dwelling be”</b> (Leviticus 13:46). His impurity is in his permanent dwelling-place. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the obligation to distance oneself from something repulsive, <b>the Torah stated</b> the principle: <b>“And your camp shall be holy”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), <b>and there is no</b> holiness in those circumstances. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | The Gemara raised an objection | Berakhot 36b:15 | <b>The Gemara raised an objection</b> to this based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>, that regarding the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>Rabbi Meir would say: By inference from that which is stated: “You shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>,” don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food? Rather,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Any tree for food”? To include a tree whose wood and fruit have the same taste. And which</b> tree <b>is this? This is the pepper</b> tree. <b>And</b> this comes <b>to teach you that the peppers,</b> and even the wood portions, are edible and are therefore <b>obligated in</b> the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>, and to teach that Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Obviously,</b> peppers are fit for consumption. |
| Leviticus 19:23 | you shall regard its fruit [ et piryo ] as orla ” | Berakhot 36b:3 | The Gemara approaches this matter from a different perspective: <b>Let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that buds are included in the prohibition of <i>orla</i> from the fact that the bud <b>serves as protection for the fruit, and the Torah says:</b> “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food <b>you shall regard its fruit [<i>et piryo</i>] as <i>orla</i>”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), and <b><i>et piryo</i></b> is interpreted to mean <b>that which is secondary to the fruit. What is that? That</b> section of the plant <b>which is protection for the fruit.</b> The buds should be prohibited as <i>orla</i>, since they protect the fruit. |
| Leviticus 19:24 | “…sanctified for praises before the Lord” | Berakhot 35a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Concerning the fundamental basis for blessings, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> the obligation to recite a blessing before eating, derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Sifra</i>: With regard to saplings, it is stated that in their fourth year their fruit will be: <b>“…sanctified for praises before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:24). This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>they require</b> praise of God in the form of a <b>blessing</b> both <b>beforehand and thereafter,</b> as the verse says praises in the plural. <b>From here, Rabbi Akiva said: A person is forbidden to taste anything before he recites a blessing,</b> as without reciting praise over food, it has the status of a consecrated item, from which one is forbidden to derive pleasure. |
| Leviticus 19:25 | so that it may increase your produce [ tevuato ]; | Berakhot 35a:5 | <b>And according to the one who taught: A fourth year grapevine, this</b> works out <b>well if he derives</b> this matter <b>from a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>],</b> and therefore need not derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <i>hillulim</i>. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It is stated here</b> with regard to the laws of the prohibition of fruit for the tree’s first three years: “But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, <b>so that it may increase your produce [<i>tevuato</i>];</b> I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:25). <b>And it is stated below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forfeited <b>with the produce [<i>utevuat</i>] of the vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). Based on a verbal analogy, it can be derived: <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards; so too, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the fruits of a sapling, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards.</b> Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, <b>one extra <i>hillul</i></b> remains from which to derive <b>the blessing.</b> Since he derives that the laws of fourth-year saplings apply only to grapes from the verbal analogy, he can derive the requirement to recite blessings before partaking of food from the word <i>hillulim</i>. |
| Leviticus 19:26 | that which is written: “You shall not eat with the blood” | Berakhot 10b:29 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26)? <b>You may not eat before you pray for your blood.</b> One may not eat before he prays. |
| Leviticus 20:26 | taught in a baraita : | Berakhot 53b:32 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> of this: <b>I do not know of Zilai or Zivai or Zuhamai; rather, I know a <i>baraita</i>, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> that it was <b>taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> It is stated: “And you shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy, for holy am I, the Lord your God” (Leviticus 20:26). With regard to this verse, the Sages said: <b>And you shall sanctify yourselves, these are the first waters</b> with which one washes his hands before the meal; <b>and you shall be holy, these are the final waters; for holy, this is oil</b> which one spreads on his hands; <b>am I, the Lord your God, this is</b> the Grace after Meals <b>blessing.</b> |
| Leviticus 20:27 | Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers. And why were they singled out | Berakhot 21b:11 | With regard to this proof <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And does</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed this matter to that warrant taking</b> this person <b>out to be stoned?</b> Should he be sentenced to the most severe of the death penalties on that basis <b>Rather,</b> the source is: <b>Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers. And why were they singled out</b> from the rest, in the verse: “And a man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones, their blood is upon them” (Leviticus 20:27)? In order to <b>draw an analogy to them and say to you: Just as a medium and a wizard</b> are executed <b>by stoning, so too is a sorceress</b> executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Leviticus 22:32 | As it is stated: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel” | Berakhot 21b:4 | <b>Similarly, Rav Adda bar Ahava stated,</b> in accordance with the second opinion: <b>From where is it derived that an individual may not recite <i>kedusha</i></b> alone? <b>As it is stated: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), <b>any expression of sanctity may not be</b> recited in a quorum of <b>fewer than ten</b> men. |
| Leviticus 23:27 | Doesn’t one fast on the tenth of Tishrei, | Berakhot 8b:3 | The Gemara wonders: <b>And does one fast on the ninth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Doesn’t one fast on the tenth of Tishrei,</b> as the Torah says at the beginning of that portion: “However, on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement; there shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27)? <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to tell you: One who eats and drinks on the ninth</b> day of Tishrei in preparation for the fast the next day, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he fasted on</b> both <b>the ninth and the tenth</b> of Tishrei. Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti cited this verse to Rav Beivai bar Abaye to teach him that Yom Kippur eve is dedicated to eating and drinking, not to completing the Torah portions one may have missed throughout the year. |
| Leviticus 23:32 | “And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month in the evening, | Berakhot 8b:2 | <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye thought to finish all the</b> Torah <b>portions of the entire year,</b> which he had been unable to complete at their appointed time, <b>on the eve of Yom Kippur</b> when he would have time to do so. But <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught him: It is written</b> with regard to Yom Kippur: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day of the month in the evening,</b> from evening to evening you shall keep your Sabbath” (Leviticus 23:32). |
| Leviticus 23:40 | “The fruit of goodly trees [ hadar ], branches of palm trees” | Berakhot 57a:9 | <b>Rav Yosef says: One who sees a goat in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his year will be blessed;</b> one who sees <b>goats, his years will be blessed, as it is stated: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,</b> for the food of your household; and sustenance for your maidens” (Proverbs 27:27). <b>One who sees myrtle in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his property will be successful. And if he does not</b> own <b>property,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will receive an inheritance. Ulla said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: This</b> applies exclusively to a case <b>where he saw</b> them <b>on their stem. One who sees a citron [<i>etrog</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>he is honored [<i>hadur</i>] before his Creator, as it is stated</b> with regard to the citron: <b>“The fruit of goodly trees [<i>hadar</i>], branches of palm trees”</b> (Leviticus 23:40). <b>One who sees a palm branch [<i>lulav</i>] in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>he has but one heart for his Father in heaven.</b> <i>Lulav</i> is interpreted homiletically as <i>lo lev</i>, he has a heart. |
| Leviticus 25:6 | Didn’t we learn | Berakhot 36b:9 | <b>Rav Shimi of Neharde’a strongly objects to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei <b>with regard to</b> the fruits <b>of all other trees</b> besides grapes, that even in the very first stage of ripening, they are considered fruit? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to fruit, which grows during the Sabbatical year, the Torah says: “And the Shabbat of the land shall be to you for eating” (Leviticus 25:6). The Sages inferred, for eating, and not for loss. Because one is prohibited from discarding fruit grown during the Sabbatical year, the question is raised: <b>From when may one no</b> longer <b>cut trees during the Sabbatical year</b> as he thereby damages the fruit? <b>Beit Shammai say: All trees, from when</b> the blossoms fall off and <b>fruit</b> begins to <b>emerge</b> in its earliest stage. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> There is a distinction between different types of trees. <b>Carob trees</b> may not be cut <b>from when they</b> form <b>chains</b> of carobs, <b>vines</b> may not be cut <b><i>misheyegaru</i>,</b> explained below, <b>olives from when they blossom, and all other trees from when</b> fruit <b>emerges.</b> |
| Leviticus 25:46 | they will serve as bondsmen for you forever” | Berakhot 47b:17 | With regard to this incident, the Gemara asks: <b>How did he do that? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say: Anyone who frees his</b> Canaanite <b>slave violates a positive mitzva, as it is stated</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: “You will keep them as an inheritance for your children after you, to hold as a possession; <b>they will serve as bondsmen for you forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? How, then, could Rabbi Eliezer have freed his slave? The Gemara answers: The case of <b>a mitzva is different.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is a mitzva that comes through a transgression,</b> and a mitzva fulfilled in that manner is inherently flawed. The Gemara responds: <b>A mitzva</b> that benefits <b>the many is different,</b> and one may free his slave for that purpose. |
| Leviticus 27:19 | for land instead of money, and the Torah states: “He will give the money and it will be assured to him” | Berakhot 47b:10 | We also learned in the mishna that if one ate <b>second tithe</b> and consecrated food that had not been redeemed, he may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara remarks: <b>It is obvious?</b> Why was it necessary for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>It was only necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they were redeemed, but not redeemed properly, i.e., second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>],</b> a silver bullion that had not been engraved. <b>And the Torah says: “And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), which the Sages interpreted as follows: <i>Vetzarta</i> refers to <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it. Consecrated property;</b> in a case <b>where he redeemed it</b> by exchanging it <b>for land instead of money, and the Torah states: “He will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). |
| Numbers 5:10 | as it is stated: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his” | Berakhot 63a:18 | <b>Ḥizkiya, son of Rabbi Parnakh, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why is the portion of <i>sota</i> juxtaposed with the portion of <i>terumot</i> and tithes</b> (Numbers ch. 5)? They are juxtaposed <b>to tell you: Anyone who has <i>terumot</i> and tithes and does not give them to a priest,</b> will <b>ultimately require</b> the services of <b>a priest by means of his wife, as it is stated: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his” (</b>Numbers 5:10). This refers to one who keeps those hallowed items for himself. <b>To this</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed: “If any man’s wife go aside and act unfaithfully against him”</b> (Numbers 5:12). <b>And it is written: “Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest”</b> (Numbers 5:15). <b>Moreover, ultimately</b> that man <b>will require</b> assistance from the tithe given to the poor, <b>as it is stated: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his”</b> (Numbers 5:10).

According to Rabbi Yehuda, in the case of <i>mezuzot</i> and phylacteries the Torah taught that even the commands must be written in order to distinguish it from <i>sota</i>. <b>There, in</b> the case of the <i>sota</i>, <b>it is written: “And</b> the priest <b>shall write [<i>vekhatav</i>] these curses</b> in a scroll” (Numbers 5:23); only the curses are recorded in the scroll, and nothing more. <b>But here</b> in the case of <i>mezuza</i>, <b>where it is written: “And you shall write them</b> [<b><i>ukhtavtam</i></b>],” <b>even the commands</b> must <b>also</b> be written. |

With regards to a woman who is falsely suspected of adultery and drank the <i>sota</i> water, the Torah <b>says:</b> “And if the woman was not defiled, but was pure, then <b>she shall be acquitted and she shall conceive”</b> (Numbers 5:28). |
| Numbers 6:7 | hear | Berakhot 19b:15 | The Gemara cites an additional proof from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was said in the Torah with regard to the Nazirite: “He shall not become impure for his father or his mother or his brother or his sister in their death, for the crown of his God is on his head” (Numbers 6:7). Since it was already written with regard to the Nazirite: “He shall not come upon a dead body” (Numbers 6:6), why is it necessary to elaborate and specify his parents and siblings? |
| Numbers 6:26 | show favor to Israel, as it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you | Berakhot 20b:15 | After citing the <i>halakha</i> that one who eats a quantity of food that does not satisfy his hunger is obligated by rabbinic law to recite Grace after Meals, the Gemara cites a related homiletic interpretation. <b>Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Asi: The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, in Your Torah it is written:</b> “The great, mighty and awesome God <b>who favors no one and takes no bribe”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>yet You,</b> nevertheless, <b>show favor to Israel, as it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <b>He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless the Lord until one is satiated; <b>yet they are exacting with themselves</b> to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten <b>as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk.</b> Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor. |
| Numbers 11:2 | “And Moses prayed to the Lord | Berakhot 32a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Moses</b> also <b>spoke impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High, as it is stated</b> in the verse following the sin of those who murmured against God in the desert: <b>“And Moses prayed to the Lord</b> and the fire subsided” (Numbers 11:2), and this verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>Do not read to [<i>el</i>] the Lord,</b> but rather <b>onto [<i>al</i>] the Lord,</b> which indicates that he spoke impertinently. |
| Numbers 12:3 | as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest” | Berakhot 54b:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in the midrash: They are the <b>stones that</b> remained <b>suspended</b> in the air and did not fall <b>because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>] and they fell down because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They</b> remained <b>suspended because of a man; that is Moses,</b> whom the verse refers to as a man, <b>as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest”</b> (Numbers 12:3), <b>and it is written:</b> “And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the Lord; <b>the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth”</b> (Exodus 9:33). Moses’ hailstones remained suspended. And the stones <b>descended because of a man; that is Joshua,</b> who was also called man, <b>as it is written: “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit”</b> (Numbers 27:18). <b>And it is written</b> that when Joshua and his people waged war against the army of the Emorite kings, God told him not to fear them because God would deliver them into his hands; and indeed, they died by means of these stones: <b>“As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beit Ḥoron, that the Lord cast down great stones</b> from heaven upon them unto Azeka, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew by sword” (Joshua 10:11). |
| Numbers 12:6 | say: And do dreams speak falsely? Isn’t it written: “I speak with him in a dream” | Berakhot 55b:14 | The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel, when he would see a bad dream,</b> would <b>say: “And the dreams speak falsely”</b> (Zechariah 10:2). <b>When he would see a good dream,</b> he would <b>say: And do dreams speak falsely? Isn’t it written: “I speak with him in a dream”</b> (Numbers 12:6)? |
| Numbers 12:8 | “gaze,” he was privileged to “behold the likeness of the Lord” | Berakhot 7a:32 | Because “Moses <b>concealed his face,</b> fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6), <b>he was privileged to</b> have his <b>countenance [<i>kelaster</i>]</b> glow. <br>Because <b>he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him”</b> (Exodus 34:30). <br>Because he did not <b>“gaze,” he was privileged to “behold the likeness of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 12:8). |
| Numbers 12:11 | “For that we have done foolishly [ noalnu ]” | Berakhot 63b:12 | The Gemara interprets the word <b><i>hasket</i></b> in this verse homiletically, as an acronym of the words <i>as</i>, make, and <i>kat</i>, group. <b>Form [<i>asu</i>] many groups [<i>kitot</i>] and study Torah, for the Torah is only acquired</b> through study <b>in a group.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina; as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [<i>habaddim</i>], and they shall become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? This verse can be interpreted homiletically: <b>A sword upon the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for the Torah scholars themselves, <b>who sit alone [<i>bad bevad</i>] and study Torah. And furthermore,</b> those who study alone <b>grow foolish, as it is written here, <i>noalu</i>, and elsewhere it is written</b> that after Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, Aaron told Moses: <b>“For that we have done foolishly [<i>noalnu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>And furthermore, they sin</b> due to that ignorance, <b>as</b> at the end of that same verse <b>it is stated:</b> “For that we have done foolishly, <b>and for that we have sinned.”</b> |
| Numbers 12:13 | ‘Please, God, heal her, please’” | Berakhot 34a:12 | There was <b>again an incident where one student descended</b> to serve as prayer leader <b>before the ark in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer, and he was excessively abbreviating his prayer. His students</b> protested <b>and said to him: How brief is his</b> prayer. <b>He said to them: Is he abbreviating</b> his prayer <b>any more than Moses our teacher</b> did? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the prayer Moses recited imploring God to cure Miriam of her leprosy: “And Moses cried out to the Lord, saying: <b>‘Please, God, heal her, please’”</b> (Numbers 12:13). This student’s prayer was certainly no briefer than the few words recited by Moses. |
| Numbers 14:16 | “The Lord did not have the ability [ yekholet ] | Berakhot 32a:27 | The Gemara moves to a discussion of additional prayers offered by Moses. Moses said that if God fails to bring the Jewish people into Eretz Yisrael, the nations of the world will say: <b>“The Lord did not have the ability [<i>yekholet</i>]</b> to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, and He killed them in the desert” (Numbers 14:16). The Gemara examines this verse closely: The verse should not have utilized the term <i>yekholet</i>, an abstract feminine noun, but rather, <b>it should have said: “The Lord</b> was not <b>able [<i>yakhol</i>],”</b> a masculine verb. |
| Numbers 14:20 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, ultimately conceded to Moses? As it is said: “And the Lord said: I have forgiven according to your word” | Berakhot 32a:29 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, ultimately conceded to Moses? As it is said: “And the Lord said: I have forgiven according to your word”</b> (Numbers 14:20). The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: According to your word,</b> it will be, as indeed <b>in the future the nations of the world will say this.</b> |
| Numbers 14:21 | “Nevertheless, as I live, | Berakhot 32a:31 | Explaining the next verse, <b>“Nevertheless, as I live,</b> and the glory of the Lord fills the entire world” (Numbers 14:21), <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> This <b>teaches</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, you have given Me life with your words.</b> I am happy that on account of your arguments, I will forgive Israel. |
| Numbers 14:27 | ten. | Berakhot 21b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>How is this inferred</b> from that verse? The Gemara responds: This must be understood in light of a <i>baraita</i>, <b>which was taught by Rabbenai, the brother</b> of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: It is inferred</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] between the words <b>among, among. Here it is written: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel,” and there,</b> regarding Korah’s congregation, <b>it is written “Separate yourselves from among this congregation”</b> (Numbers 16:21). <b>Just as there</b> among connotes <b>ten, so too here,</b> among connotes <b>ten.</b> The connotation of ten associated with the word among written in the portion of Korah is, in turn, derived by means of another verbal analogy between the word congregation written there and the word congregation written in reference to the ten spies who slandered Eretz Yisrael: “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?” (Numbers 14:27). Consequently, among the congregation there must be at least ten. |
| Numbers 15:31 | from here: “For he has shown contempt for the word of the Lord” | Berakhot 24b:20 | <b>Rav Asi said</b> that this is derived from the verse: <b>“Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity”</b> (Isaiah 5:18), meaning that this man brings sin upon himself for naught. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> it is derived <b>from here: “For he has shown contempt for the word of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:31), meaning that uttering God’s word in a place of filth shows contempt for the Lord. |
| Numbers 15:38 | as it is written: “And they will make for themselves ritual fringes” | Berakhot 12b:21 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, these three are mentioned explicitly: The yoke of mitzvot</b> is mentioned in the portion of ritual fringes, <b>as it is written: “And you shall look upon them and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord</b> and you shall do them” (Numbers 15:39). <b>Ritual fringes</b> are mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written: “And they will make for themselves ritual fringes”</b> (Numbers 15:38). <b>The exodus from Egypt</b> is also mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written:</b> “I am the Lord, your God, <b>who took you out</b> from the Land of Egypt” (Numbers 15:41). <b>But where do we</b> derive the other elements mentioned above: Admonition against <b>the opinions of the heretics,</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, <b>and</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of idolatry?</b> |
| Numbers 15:39 | as it is written: “And you shall look upon them and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord | Berakhot 12b:21 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, these three are mentioned explicitly: The yoke of mitzvot</b> is mentioned in the portion of ritual fringes, <b>as it is written: “And you shall look upon them and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord</b> and you shall do them” (Numbers 15:39). <b>Ritual fringes</b> are mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written: “And they will make for themselves ritual fringes”</b> (Numbers 15:38). <b>The exodus from Egypt</b> is also mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written:</b> “I am the Lord, your God, <b>who took you out</b> from the Land of Egypt” (Numbers 15:41). <b>But where do we</b> derive the other elements mentioned above: Admonition against <b>the opinions of the heretics,</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, <b>and</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of idolatry?</b> |
| Numbers 15:41 | who took you out | Berakhot 12b:21 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, these three are mentioned explicitly: The yoke of mitzvot</b> is mentioned in the portion of ritual fringes, <b>as it is written: “And you shall look upon them and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord</b> and you shall do them” (Numbers 15:39). <b>Ritual fringes</b> are mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written: “And they will make for themselves ritual fringes”</b> (Numbers 15:38). <b>The exodus from Egypt</b> is also mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written:</b> “I am the Lord, your God, <b>who took you out</b> from the Land of Egypt” (Numbers 15:41). <b>But where do we</b> derive the other elements mentioned above: Admonition against <b>the opinions of the heretics,</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, <b>and</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of idolatry?</b> |
| Numbers 16:21 | it is written “Separate yourselves from among this congregation” | Berakhot 21b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>How is this inferred</b> from that verse? The Gemara responds: This must be understood in light of a <i>baraita</i>, <b>which was taught by Rabbenai, the brother</b> of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: It is inferred</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] between the words <b>among, among.

| Numbers 18:26 | on the stalks is exempt from teruma gedola , as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe” | Berakhot 47a:15 | We learned in the mishna: If, among the diners, one ate <b>first tithe from which its <i>teruma</i> was</b> already <b>taken,</b> he may be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara remarks: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <i>teruma</i> was already taken there is no problem. Why was it necessary for the mishna to teach that one can join a <i>zimmun</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>It was only necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> a case where the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, and he separated the <i>teruma</i> of the tithes</b> but <b>did not separate the <i>teruma gedola</i>.</b> <i>Teruma gedola</i> was not separated from the tithe that was eaten by the Levite. Although this should not be done <i>ab initio</i>, after the fact it is permitted, and one who eats first tithe produce under these circumstances may be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: First tithe</b> in which the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks is exempt from <i>teruma gedola</i>, as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26). This verse <b>teaches</b> that the Levite is obligated to set apart <b>a tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe <b>and not <i>teruma gedola</i> and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b> |
| Numbers 18:29 | “From all of that is given to you, you shall set apart | Berakhot 47b:1 | <b>“From all of that is given to you, you shall set apart</b> that which is the Lord’s <i>teruma</i>” (Numbers 18:29). God’s <i>teruma</i>, <i>teruma gedola</i>, must be taken from all of the Levites’ gifts. The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to require <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from grain in piles and not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This,</b> after it was threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that,</b> which remained on the stalk, <b>did not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> The verse regarding <i>teruma gedola</i> states: “The first of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4), is given to the priest. Once it is considered grain, the right of the priest takes effect and the Levite is required to separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. |
| Numbers 19:14 | that matters of Torah are only retained by one who kills himself over it? As it is stated: “This is the Torah: When one dies in a tent” | Berakhot 63b:14 | The Gemara offers <b>an alternative</b> explanation of this verse: <b>“Keep silence [<i>hasket</i>] and hear, Israel”; break [<i>kattetu</i>] yourselves over words of the Torah.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that matters of Torah are only retained by one who kills himself over it? As it is stated: “This is the Torah: When one dies in a tent”</b> (Numbers 19:14); true Torah study demands the total devotion of one who is willing to dedicate his life in the tent of Torah. |
| Numbers 21:9 | He ground the copper snake | Berakhot 10b:7 | <b>With regard to three</b> actions the Sages <b>agreed with him:</b> <br><b>He suppressed the Book of Remedies, and they agreed with him.</b> <br><b>He ground the copper snake</b> through which miracles were performed for Israel (Numbers 21:9), destroying it because it had been used in idol worship (II Kings 18:4), <b>and they agreed with him.</b> <br><b>He dragged the bones of his</b> evil <b>father,</b> King Ahaz, <b>on a bed of ropes;</b> meaning he did not accord his father a funeral fit for a king (II Chronicles 28:27), <b>and they agreed with him.</b> |
| Numbers 21:14 | And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa, | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Numbers 21:15 | as it is stated: “And at the cascade of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies upon the border of Moab” | Berakhot 54b:1 | <b>and prepared caves for themselves and they hid in them. They said: When Israel passes here we will kill them. And they did not know</b> that the <b>Ark</b> of the Covenant <b>preceded</b> the children of <b>Israel and would flatten mountains before them.

When Et and Hev,</b> the lepers, <b>arrived, they saw the blood that was emerging from between the mountains, and they came and told Israel</b> what had happened. Israel <b>recited</b> a <b>song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: “And at the cascade of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies upon the border of Moab”</b> (Numbers 21:15). This refers to the cascade of the brooks where the mountain, which had once been a valley, spread out in the direction of the mountain in Ar, in Moab. |
| Numbers 23:8 | And that is what Balaam said to Balak: “How can I curse whom God has not cursed? And how can I condemn whom God has not condemned?” | Berakhot 7a:13 | <b>And that is what Balaam said to Balak: “How can I curse whom God has not cursed? And how can I condemn whom God has not condemned?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). This verse <b>teaches that all those days,</b> God <b>was not angry.</b> |
| Numbers 23:22 | as it is written therein: “God, who brought them forth out of Egypt, | Berakhot 12b:15 | The Gemara seeks: <b>Why</b> did the Sages seek to add the blessings of Balaam in the first place? <b>If you say</b> that they did so <b>because</b> the exodus from Egypt is mentioned, <b>as it is written therein: “God, who brought them forth out of Egypt,</b> is like the horns of the wild ram” (Numbers 23:22), certainly mention of the Exodus is not unique to this Torah portion. Many other portions mention the exodus as well. <b>Let us say the portion of usury</b> (Leviticus 25:35–38) or the <b>portion of weights</b> (Leviticus 19:35–37), <b>as the exodus from Egypt is written therein</b> as well. In addition, they are brief and would not constitute an encumbrance on the congregation. |
| Numbers 23:22 | as it is written: “God who brought them forth [ motziam ] from Egypt | Berakhot 38a:14 | We learned in the mishna <b>that over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What does</b> one who eats bread <b>recite</b> before eating? <b>Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that the blessing is phrased: <b>Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rava said: Everyone agrees that</b> the term <b><i>motzi</i> means brought,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “God who brought them forth [<i>motziam</i>] from Egypt</b> is for them like the horns of the wild ox” (Numbers 23:22). <b>When do they disagree? With regard to</b> the term <b><i>hamotzi</i>, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brought forth,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “Who brought forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] for you water from a rock of flint”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the term <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brings forth</b> in the present tense, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am the Lord your God <b>who is bringing you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, <i>hamotzi</i> is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past. |
| Numbers 24:6 | tents juxtaposed to streams, as it is written: “As streams stretched forth, as gardens by the riverside; as aloes [ ahalim ] planted | Berakhot 16a:1 | <b>tents juxtaposed to streams, as it is written: “As streams stretched forth, as gardens by the riverside; as aloes [<i>ahalim</i>] planted</b> by the Lord, as cedars by the water” (Numbers 24:6)? The Gemara vocalizes the word <i>ohalim</i>, tents, rather than <i>ahalim</i>. They are juxtaposed in order <b>to tell you: Just as streams elevate a person from ritual impurity to purity</b> after he immerses himself in their water, <b>so too tents</b> of Torah <b>elevate a person from the scale of guilt to the scale of merit.</b> |
| Numbers 24:9 | because it is written therein: “He couched, He lay down like a lion and a lioness; who shall rouse Him? | Berakhot 12b:16 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said:</b> The reason the Sages sought to establish the portion of Balak as part of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> is <b>because it is written therein: “He couched, He lay down like a lion and a lioness; who shall rouse Him?</b> Those who bless You are blessed and those who curse You are cursed” (Numbers 24:9). This is reminiscent of what is said in <i>Shema</i>: When you lie down, and when you rise. |
| Numbers 24:16 | except for Balaam the wicked, about whom it is written: “He who knows the knowledge of the Most High” | Berakhot 7a:8 | <b>How much</b> time does <b>His anger</b> last? God’s anger lasts <b>a moment. And how</b> long <b>is a moment? One fifty-eight thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eighth of an hour, that is a moment.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And no creature can</b> precisely <b>determine that moment</b> when God becomes angry, <b>except for Balaam the wicked, about whom it is written: “He who knows the knowledge of the Most High”</b> (Numbers 24:16). |
| Numbers 27:18 | as it is written: “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit” | Berakhot 54b:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in the midrash: They are the <b>stones that</b> remained <b>suspended</b> in the air and did not fall <b>because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>] and they fell down because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They</b> remained <b>suspended because of a man; that is Moses,</b> whom the verse refers to as a man, <b>as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest”</b> (Numbers 12:3), <b>and it is written:</b> “And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the Lord; <b>the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth”</b> (Exodus 9:33). Moses’ hailstones remained suspended. And the stones <b>descended because of a man; that is Joshua,</b> who was also called man, <b>as it is written: “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit”</b> (Numbers 27:18). <b>And it is written</b> that when Joshua and his people waged war against the army of the Emorite kings, God told him not to fear them because God would deliver them into his hands; and indeed, they died by means of these stones: <b>“As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beit Ḥoron, that the Lord cast down great stones</b> from heaven upon them unto Azeka, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew by sword” (Joshua 10:11). |
| Numbers 30:3 | it is written: “He shall not nullify [ lo yaḥel ] his word” | Berakhot 32a:19 | The Torah continues: <b>“And Moses beseeched [<i>vayḥal</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11). Many interpretations were given for this uncommon term, <i>vayḥal</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It <b>teaches that Moses stood in prayer before the Holy One, Blessed be He, until it made him ill [</b><i>heḥelahu</i><b>]</b> from overexertion. <b>And Rava said:</b> Moses stood in prayer <b>until he nullified His vow,</b> as the term <i>vayḥal</i> alludes to nullification of an oath. <b>Here it is written <i>vayḥal</i>, and there</b> referring to vows, <b>it is written: “He shall not nullify [<i>lo yaḥel</i>] his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). <b>And</b> with regard to vows, <b>the Master said: He</b> who vowed <b>cannot nullify</b> his vow, <b>but others,</b> the court, <b>can nullify</b> his vow <b>for him.</b> Here, it is as if Moses nullified the Lord’s vow to destroy Israel. |
| Numbers 31:50 | her, didn’t Rav Sheshet say: Why did the verse enumerate | Berakhot 24a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak stated: An</b> exposed <b>handbreadth in a woman</b> constitutes <b>nakedness.</b> The Gemara asks: Regarding <b>which</b> <i>halakha</i> was this said? <b>If you say</b> that it comes to prohibit <b>looking at</b> an exposed handbreadth in <b>her, didn’t Rav Sheshet say: Why did the verse enumerate</b> “anklets and bracelets, rings, earrings and girdles” (Numbers 31:50), <b>jewelry that is</b> worn <b>externally,</b> over her clothing, e.g., bracelets, <b>together with jewelry</b> worn <b>internally,</b> beneath her clothing, near her nakedness, e.g., girdles? This was <b>to tell you: Anyone who gazes upon a woman’s little finger</b> is considered <b>as if he gazed upon her</b> naked <b>genitals,</b> for if his intentions are impure, it makes no difference where he looks or how much is exposed; even less than a handbreadth. |
| Numbers 32:3 | “Atarot and Divon | Berakhot 8b:1 | This applies to every verse, <b>even</b> a verse like: <b>“Atarot and Divon</b> and Yazer and Nimra and Ḥeshbon and Elaleh and Sevam and Nevo and Beon” (Numbers 32:3). While that verse is comprised entirely of names of places that are identical in Hebrew and Aramaic, one is nevertheless required to read the verse twice and its translation once, <b>as one who completes his</b> Torah <b>portions with the congregation</b> is rewarded that <b>his days and years are extended.</b> |
| Numbers 33:3 | Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand | Berakhot 9a:25 | The Gemara cites an alternative explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Elazer ben Azarya and Rabbi Akiva. <b>Rabbi Abba said: Everyone agrees that when</b> the children of <b>Israel were redeemed from Egypt</b> were given permission to leave, <b>they were redeemed only in the evening, as it is stated:</b> “In the spring <b>the Lord, your God, took you out from Egypt at night”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1). <b>And when they</b> actually <b>left, they left only during the day, as it is stated:</b> “On the fifteenth of the first month, <b>on the day after the</b> offering of the <b>Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand</b> before the eyes of Egypt” (Numbers 33:3), indicating that they actually went out during the day. |
| Deuteronomy 1:1 | “And Di Zahav” | Berakhot 32a:7 | The Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai,</b> however, <b>say</b> proof that Moses spoke impertinently toward God on High is derived <b>from here,</b> Moses’ rebuke at the beginning of Deuteronomy: <b>“And Di Zahav”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:1). This is an entry in a list of places where Moses had spoken to Israel. As there was no place encountered by that name, it is interpreted as an allusion to another matter. |
| Deuteronomy 3:23 | [ titḥonen ], as it is written: “And I pleaded [ va’etḥanan ] before the Lord” | Berakhot 30b:9 | The Gemara points out that both Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda based their positions on the prayers of Moses. <b>The one who said: So that his mind will be in a pleading</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥonen</i>], as it is written: “And I pleaded [<i>va’etḥanan</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And the one who said: So that his mind will be in a beseeching</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥolel</i>] as it is written: “And Moses besought [<i>vayeḥal</i>] the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11). |
| Deuteronomy 3:23 | “And I beseeched the Lord at that time” | Berakhot 32a:32 | Based on Moses’ prayers, <b>Rabbi Simlai taught: One should always set forth praise of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and then pray</b> for his own needs. <b>From where do we</b> derive that one should conduct himself in this manner? <b>From Moses, as it is written</b> in his prayer: <b>“And I beseeched the Lord at that time”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And</b> immediately afterward in his prayer, <b>it is written: “Lord, God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for what God is there in the heavens or on earth who can perform deeds such as Yours and Your might”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:24)?

| Deuteronomy 3:25 | Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon” | Berakhot 48b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Grace after Meals is from the Torah?

The Gemara explains: <b>And you shall bless, that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all. <b>The Lord, your God, that is the <i>zimmun</i> blessing</b> in which God’s name is invoked. <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land; good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25), which is interpreted homiletically as referring to Jerusalem and the Temple. <b>That He gave you, that is: Who is good and does good.</b> However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>You said</b> that it can be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: When one is satisfied, he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> and thank God for food; <b>when he is hungry, all the more so</b> that he should recite a blessing to offer thanks for the food he will eat. |

| Deuteronomy 4:9 | from Mount Horeb. As it is stated: “And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children” | Berakhot 21b:15 | At any rate, we see that in Deuteronomy, Rabbi Yehuda derives homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed verses. Why does he fail to derive that one who experiences a seminal emission is prohibited from engaging in matters of Torah from the juxtaposition of the verses? <b>They replied: Indeed, in <i>Mishne Torah</i></b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>does derive homiletic interpretations</b> from the juxtaposition of verses, <b>but</b> he requires <b>these juxtaposed verses</b> in order <b>to</b> derive <b>another</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes to him</b> credit <b>as if he received</b> the Torah <b>from Mount Horeb. As it is stated: “And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9) <b>after which it is written: “The day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb.”</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda cannot derive from that same juxtaposition a prohibition banning one who experienced a seminal emission from engaging in matters of Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | and you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children” | Berakhot 21b:8 | We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> with regard to one who experiences a seminal emission; <b>he recites a blessing beforehand and afterward</b> in both the case of <i>Shema</i> and in the case of food. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabbi Yehuda holds that one who experienced a seminal emission is permitted</b> to engage <b>in matters of Torah? Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: From where</b> in the Torah is it derived <b>that one who experiences a seminal emission is prohibited from</b> engaging <b>in matters of Torah? As it is stated:</b> “Just take heed and guard your soul diligently lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart, for all the days of your life, <b>and you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9), from which we derive, among other things, the obligation to study Torah. <b>And, juxtaposed to it,</b> is the verse: <b>“The day that you stood</b> before the Lord your God at Horeb” (Deuteronomy 4:10). This juxtaposition teaches us that <b>just as below,</b> at the revelation at Mount Sinai, <b>those who experienced a seminal emission were prohibited</b> and were commanded to refrain from relations with their wives and immerse themselves, <b>so too here,</b> throughout the generations, <b>those who experience a seminal emission are prohibited</b> from engaging in Torah study. |

| Deuteronomy 5:12 | “Observe | Berakhot 20b:10 | <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> This has a unique explanation. In the Ten Commandments in the book of Exodus, <b>the verse said: “Remember</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Exodus 20:8), while in the book of Deuteronomy it is said: <b>“Observe</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Deuteronomy 5:12). From these two variants we can deduce that <b>anyone included in</b> the obligation to <b>observe</b> Shabbat by avoiding its desecration, <b>is</b> also <b>included in</b> the mitzva to <b>remember</b> Shabbat by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>Since these women are included in</b> the mitzva <b>to observe</b> Shabbat, as there is no distinction between men and women in the obligation to observe prohibitions in general and to refrain from the desecration of Shabbat in particular, so too <b>are they included in</b> the mitzva of <b>remembering</b> Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | as it is stated: “Hear, | Berakhot 13a:27 | The Gemara seeks to clarify further: <b>And what is the reason for the Rabbis’</b> opinion? The Gemara answers: The source upon which the Rabbis base their opinion is, <b>as it is stated: “Hear,</b> Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4), which they understand to mean that <i>Shema</i> must be understood. Therefore, one may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>in any language that you</b> can <b>hear</b> and understand. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | “Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One” | Berakhot 6a:22 | <b>You have made Me a single entity in the world, as it is stated</b> that Israel declares God’s oneness by saying: <b>“Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> because of this, <b>I will make you a single entity in the world,</b> unique and elevated with the utterance: <b>“Who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land?”</b> Consequently, the Holy One, Blessed be He, is glorified through the glory of Israel whose praises are written in God’s phylacteries. |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | as it is stated: “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, | Berakhot 54a:6 | The mishna articulates a general principle: <b>One is obligated to recite a blessing for the bad</b> that befalls him <b>just as he recites a blessing for the good</b> that befalls him, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,</b> with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:5). The mishna explains this verse as follows: “<b>With all your heart”</b> means <b>with your two inclinations, with your good inclination and your evil inclination,</b> both of which must be subjugated to the love of God. <b>“With all your soul”</b> means <b>even if God takes your soul. “And with all your might”</b> means <b>with all your money,</b> as money is referred to in the Bible as might. <b>Alternatively,</b> it may be explained that “<b>with all your might”</b> means <b>with every measure that He metes out to you;</b> whether it is good or troublesome, <b>thank Him.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | “And you shall love the Lord your God | Berakhot 61b:5 | We learned in our mishna the explanation of the verse: <b>“And you shall love the Lord your God</b> with all your heart and all your soul and all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:5). This was elaborated upon when <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If it is stated: “With all your soul,” why does it state: “With all your might”?</b> Conversely, <b>if it stated: “With all your might,” why does it state: “With all your soul”? Rather,</b> this means that <b>if one’s body is dearer to him than his property, therefore it is stated: “With all your soul”;</b> one must give his soul in sanctification of God. <b>And if one’s money is dearer to him than his body, therefore it is stated: “With all your might”;</b> with all your assets. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: “With all your soul”</b> means: <b>Even if</b> God <b>takes your soul.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:6 | will be | Berakhot 13a:26 | The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion? The Gemara answers: The source for his <i>halakha</i> lies in the emphasis on the word: <b>“And</b> these words, which I command you this day, <b>will be</b> upon your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:6). “Will be” means <b>as they are, so shall they be;</b> they should remain unchanged, in their original language. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | when you lie down and when you rise” | Berakhot 21a:8 | <b>Rav Yosef raises an objection:</b> How can you say that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> is only by rabbinic law when it is explicitly written: “And you shall recite them to your children and speak of them when you sit in your home and when you walk by the way, <b>when you lie down and when you rise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7)? <b>Abaye said to him: That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to matters of Torah.</b> One need not interpret the verse in the conventional manner, as obligating the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, but rather as referring to the general obligation to study Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | Until the end of the first watch. | Berakhot 2a:1 | The beginning of tractate <i>Berakhot</i>, the first tractate in the first of the six orders of Mishna, opens with a discussion of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, as the recitation of <i>Shema</i> encompasses an acceptance of the yoke of Heaven and of the mitzvot, and as such, forms the basis for all subsequent teachings. The Mishna opens with the laws regarding the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i>: <br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From when,</b> that is, from what time, does <b>one recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma.</i></b> Until when does the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> extend? <b>Until the end of the first watch.</b> The term used in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:7) to indicate the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <i>beshokhbekha</i>, when you lie down, which refers to the time in which individuals go to sleep. Therefore, the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> is the first portion of the night, when individuals typically prepare for sleep. <b>That is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | when you lie down, and when you arise” | Berakhot 2a:8 | The Gemara offers a single response to both questions: <b>The <i>tanna</i> bases himself on the verse as it is written:</b> “You will talk of them when you sit in your home, and when you walk along the way, <b>when you lie down, and when you arise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7). By teaching the laws of the evening <i>Shema</i> first, the <i>tanna</i> has established that the teachings of the Oral Torah correspond to that which is taught in the Written Torah. <b>And</b> based on the Written Torah, <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> the oral law: <b>When is the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> of lying down</b> as commanded in the Torah? <b>From when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> Just as the Written Torah begins with the evening <i>Shema</i>, so too must the Oral Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | “And you shall bind them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | mezuza , | Berakhot 20b:4 | We also learned in the mishna that women are exempt <b>from phylacteries.</b> The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious</b> as well. The donning of phylacteries is only in effect at particular times; during the day but not at night, on weekdays but not on Shabbat or Festivals. The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since</b> the mitzva of phylacteries <b>is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>,</b> as it is written: “And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hands and they shall be frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), followed by: “And you shall write them upon the door posts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9), just as women are obligated in the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>, so too they are obligated in the mitzva of phylacteries. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, women are exempt. |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And write them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them [ ukhtavtam ] | Berakhot 15b:23 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava:</b> The verse, <b>“And you shall write them [<i>ukhtavtam</i>]</b> on the door posts of your house and your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9), should be understood as though it were written: “And you shall write them completely [<i>ukhtav tam</i>],” i.e., in their entirety. <b>Everything must be in writing</b> in the <i>mezuza</i> or phylacteries, <b>even the commands</b> to write <i>mezuzot</i> and phylacteries. |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | if one erred between writing and writing, | Berakhot 16a:4 | <b>One who recited</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and erred, and does not know where</b> exactly <b>he erred;</b> if he was <b>in the middle of a paragraph</b> when he realized his error, <b>he must return to the beginning</b> of the paragraph; <b>if</b> he was <b>between one paragraph and another</b> when he realized his error but does not remember between which paragraphs, <b>he must return to the first</b> break between <b>paragraphs.</b> Similarly, <b>if one erred between writing and writing,</b> i.e., between the verse: “And you shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9) in the first paragraph and the identical verse (Deuteronomy 11:20) in the second paragraph, <b>he must return to the first writing.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:13 | and He will bless the fruit of your body” | Berakhot 51b:5 | The Gemara relates: <b>Ulla happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Naḥman. He ate bread, recited Grace after Meals, and gave the cup of blessing to Rav Naḥman. Rav Naḥman said to him: Master, please send the cup of blessing to Yalta,</b> my wife. Ulla <b>responded to him:</b> There is no need, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: The fruit of a woman’s body is blessed only from the fruit of a man’s body, as it is stated:</b> “And He will love you, and bless you, and make you numerous, <b>and He will bless the fruit of your body”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:13). The Gemara infers: “He will bless <b>the fruit of her body” was not stated. Rather,</b> “He will bless <b>the fruit of your</b> [masculine singular] <b>body.”</b> For his wife to be blessed with children, it is sufficient to give the cup to Rav Naḥman. |
| Deuteronomy 8:5 | Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: “As a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you” | Berakhot 5a:22 | <b>Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: “As a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:5), <b>and it is written thereafter: “For the Lord your God will bring you to a good land.”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | in terms of blessing as well, as it is stated: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” | Berakhot 41a:8 | <b>As Rav Yosef, and some say Rabbi Yitzḥak, said: Each</b> food whose significance is manifest in that it <b>precedes</b> the others <b>in this verse,</b> which sings the praises of Eretz Yisrael, <b>takes precedence</b> over the others <b>in terms of blessing as well, as it is stated: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:8). |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | “A land of wheat and barley, | Berakhot 44a:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley,</b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless the Lord your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). Rabban Gamliel concludes from here that the fruits for which Eretz Yisrael was praised are included in the mitzva to recite a blessing after eating. Since that Torah portion alludes to three blessings, fruit also requires three blessings. |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | orla , and to teach that Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing” | Berakhot 36b:15 | <b>The Gemara raised an objection</b> to this based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>, that regarding the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>Rabbi Meir would say: By inference from that which is stated: “You shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>,” don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food? Rather,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Any tree for food”? To include a tree whose wood and fruit have the same taste. And which</b> tree <b>is this? This is the pepper</b> tree. <b>And</b> this comes <b>to teach you that the peppers,</b> and even the wood portions, are edible and are therefore <b>obligated in</b> the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>, and to teach that Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Obviously,</b> peppers are fit for consumption. |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity” | Berakhot 44a:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley,</b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless the Lord your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10).

| Deuteronomy 8:10 | He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God” | Berakhot 20b:15 | After citing the <i>halakha</i> that one who eats a quantity of food that does not satisfy his hunger is obligated by rabbinic law to recite Grace after Meals, the Gemara cites a related homiletic interpretation. <b>Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Asi: The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, in Your Torah it is written:</b> “The great, mighty and awesome God <b>who favors no one and takes no bribe”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>yet You,</b> nevertheless, <b>show favor to Israel, as it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <b>He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless the Lord until one is satiated; <b>yet they are exacting with themselves</b> to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten <b>as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk.</b> Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” | Berakhot 21a:3 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: From where is</b> the mitzva <b>by Torah law</b> to recite <b>Grace after Meals,</b> derived? <b>As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10). |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless the Lord your God | Berakhot 44a:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley,</b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless the Lord your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10).

Since that Torah portion alludes to three blessings, fruit also requires three blessings. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | Grace after Meals is from the Torah? As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless | Berakhot 48b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Grace after Meals is from the Torah? As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless</b> the Lord, your God, for the good land that He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Gemara explains: <b>And you shall bless, that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all. <b>The Lord, your God, that is the <i>zimmun</i> blessing</b> in which God’s name is invoked. <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land; good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25), which is interpreted homiletically as referring to Jerusalem and the Temple. <b>That He gave you, that is: Who is good and does good.</b> However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>You said</b> that it can be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: When one is satisfied, he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> and thank God for food; <b>when he is hungry, all the more so</b> that he should recite a blessing to offer thanks for the food he will eat. |
| Deuteronomy 8:14 | from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget the Lord” | Berakhot 32a:12 | On a similar note, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: That is what people say</b> in a popular maxim: <b>Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me”</b> (Hosea 13:6). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This principle is derived not from the verse in Hosea, but <b>from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14). <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn</b> to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:20). |
| Deuteronomy 8:15 | as it is written: “Who brought forth [ hamotzi ] for you water from a rock of flint” | Berakhot 38a:14 | We learned in the mishna <b>that over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What does</b> one who eats bread <b>recite</b> before eating? <b>Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that the blessing is phrased: <b>Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rava said: Everyone agrees that</b> the term <b><i>motzi</i> means brought,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “God who brought them forth [<i>motziam</i>] from Egypt</b> is for them like the horns of the wild ox” (Numbers 23:22). <b>When do they disagree? With regard to</b> the term <b><i>hamotzi</i>, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brought forth,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “Who brought forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] for you water from a rock of flint”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the term <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brings forth</b> in the present tense, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am the Lord your God <b>who is bringing you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, <i>hamotzi</i> is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past. |
| Deuteronomy 9:14 | “Leave Me be, that I may destroy them” | Berakhot 32a:14 | The Gemara elaborates upon additional aspects of the sin of the Golden Calf. It is stated: <b>“And the Lord said to Moses: Go and descend,</b> for your people whom you have lifted out of the land of Egypt have been corrupted” (Exodus 32:7). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“go and descend”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, descend from your greatness. Isn’t it only for the sake of Israel,</b> so that you may serve as an emissary, <b>that I granted you prominence; and now that Israel has sinned, why do I</b> need <b>you?</b> There is no need for an emissary. <b>Immediately, Moses’ strength waned and he was powerless to speak</b> in defense of Israel. <b>And once</b> God <b>said</b> to Moses: <b>“Leave Me be, that I may destroy them”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:14), <b>Moses said</b> to himself: If God is telling me to let Him be, it must be because <b>this matter is dependent upon me. Immediately Moses stood and was strengthened in prayer, and asked</b> that God have <b>mercy</b> on the nation of Israel and forgive them for their transgression. |
| Deuteronomy 9:14 | and I will make from you a nation mightier | Berakhot 7a:35 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that all of God’s promises are fulfilled? We know this <b>from Moses our teacher,</b> as God promised and <b>said: “Leave Me alone; I will destroy them</b> and blot out their name from under heaven; <b>and I will make from you a nation mightier</b> and greater than they” (Deuteronomy 9:14). <b>Even though</b> Moses <b>prayed</b> to have the decree repealed, <b>and</b> it <b>was nullified, the promise was fulfilled</b> and Moses’ <b>descendants</b> became a nation mightier and greater than the 600,000 Israelites in the desert. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Levites: <b>“The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer…and the sons of Eliezer were Reḥaviya the chief.</b> And Eliezer had no other sons; <b>and the sons of Reḥaviya were very many”</b> (I Chronicles 23:15–17). |
| Deuteronomy 9:25 | for the forty days and forty nights | Berakhot 34a:11 | Continuing on the subject of prayer, <b>the Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident where one student descended</b> to serve as prayer leader <b>before the ark in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer, and he was excessively prolonging his prayer. His students</b> complained and <b>said to him: How long-winded he is. He said to them: Is</b> this student <b>prolonging</b> his prayer any more <b>than Moses our teacher</b> did? <b>As about</b> Moses <b>it is written:</b> “And I prostrated myself before the Lord <b>for the forty days and forty nights</b> that I prostrated myself” (Deuteronomy 9:25). There is no limit to the duration of a prayer. |
| Deuteronomy 10:10 | and it is written thereafter: “And the Lord heard me that time as well, | Berakhot 32b:8 | The Gemara cites other statements in praise of prayer: <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer is</b> assured that <b>his prayer does not return unanswered;</b> it will surely be accepted. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Moses our teacher, as it is stated</b> that Moses said: “So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; <b>and I prayed to the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:26–27), <b>and it is written thereafter: “And the Lord heard me that time as well,</b> the Lord would not destroy you” (Deuteronomy 10:10). |
| Deuteronomy 10:12 | as it is stated: “And now Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear | Berakhot 33b:23 | Tangentially, the Gemara cites an additional statement by Rabbi Ḥanina concerning principles of faith. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.</b> Man has free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear</b> the Lord your God, to walk in all of His ways, to love Him and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The Lord asks man to perform these matters because ultimately, the choice is in his hands. |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | who favors no one and takes no bribe” | Berakhot 20b:15 | After citing the <i>halakha</i> that one who eats a quantity of food that does not satisfy his hunger is obligated by rabbinic law to recite Grace after Meals, the Gemara cites a related homiletic interpretation. <b>Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Asi: The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, in Your Torah it is written:</b> “The great, mighty and awesome God <b>who favors no one and takes no bribe”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>yet You,</b> nevertheless, <b>show favor to Israel, as it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <b>He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless the Lord until one is satiated; <b>yet they are exacting with themselves</b> to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten <b>as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk.</b> Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor. |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year” | Berakhot 55a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: Three</b> matters <b>require</b> a plea for <b>mercy</b> to bring them about: <b>A good king, a good year, and a good dream.</b> These three, kings, years, and dreams, are all bestowed by God and one must pray that they should be positive and constructive. The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses:</b> He turns it whithersoever He will” (Proverbs 21:1). A <b>good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). And a <b>good dream, as it is written:</b> “O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore <b>You will recover me [<i>vataḥlimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). Due to their apparent etymological similarity, the word <i>taḥlimeni</i> is interpreted as deriving from the word <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Deuteronomy 11:14 | and it is written: “And you shall gather your grain, | Berakhot 35b:4 | On a similar note, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction: It is written, “I will take back My grain at its time</b> and wine in its season” (Hosea 2:11), <b>and it is written: “And you shall gather your grain,</b> your wine and your oil” (Deuteronomy 11:14). To whom does the grain belong: To God, or to the people? |
| Deuteronomy 11:15 | then: “And you shall eat and be satisfied” | Berakhot 40a:1 | Continuing to discuss the <i>halakhot</i> of breaking bread, <b>Rav said:</b> One who broke bread, and before eating it, offered a piece to another, and said: <b>Take</b> it and <b>recite a blessing, take</b> it and <b>recite a blessing, need not recite the blessing</b> a second time, because that is considered to have been for the purpose of the blessing. If, however, he said: <b>Bring salt or bring relish, he must recite the blessing</b> a second time, as that is considered an interruption between the blessing and eating the bread. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if he said: <b>Bring salt</b> or <b>bring relish,</b> it is not considered an interruption <b>and he need not recite the blessing</b> a second time. Only if he said: <b>Mix</b> the food <b>for the oxen, mix</b> the food <b>for the oxen,</b> it is considered an interruption <b>and he is required to recite the blessing</b> a second time. <b>And Rav Sheshet said: Even</b> if he said: <b>Mix for the oxen, he need not recite a blessing</b> a second time, as that is also considered to be for the purpose of the blessing, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One is prohibited from eating before feeding his animals, as it is stated: “And I will give grass in your fields for your animals”</b> first <b>and</b> only <b>then: “And you shall eat and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:15). In the verse, preparation of food for one’s cattle precedes preparation of his own food. Consequently, it is considered part of the preparation for one’s own meal. |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | to speak of them” | Berakhot 13b:5 | At first the Gemara understands that Rav Zutra required recitation only in the second paragraph, while in the first paragraph only intent was required. Therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>What is different,</b> that <b>from here on,</b> beginning with the second paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of recitation?</b> Is it because <b>it is written:</b> “And you shall teach them to your children, <b>to speak of them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19)? This is no proof, as <b>here too,</b> in the first paragraph <b>it is written: “And you shall speak of them.”</b> The mitzva of recitation applies to the first paragraph as well. |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | “And you shall teach them [ velimadtem ] | Berakhot 15b:27 | On a similar note: <b>Rav Ovadya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava:</b> That which was stated: <b>“And you shall teach them [<i>velimadtem</i>]</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 11:19) teaches that <b>your teaching must be complete [<i>tam</i>] that one</b> should <b>leave space between adjacent</b> words, where the last letter of the first and the first letter of the second are identical. One must distinguish between the words and enunciate each one clearly. |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | begin: “In order to lengthen your days” | Berakhot 16a:5 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: They only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one did not</b> yet <b>begin: “In order to lengthen your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21) which follows that verse at the end of the second paragraph. <b>However, if he</b> already <b>began</b> to recite: <b>In order to lengthen your days,</b> he can assume that <b>he assumed his routine and continued</b> and completed the second paragraph. |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land | Berakhot 8a:6 | The Gemara relates that when the Sages <b>told Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land</b> the Lord swore to your forefathers to give to them like the days of heaven on the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21); lengthened in Eretz Yisrael <b>but not outside of the Land.</b> Why then, do the residents of Babylonia live long lives? <b>When they told him</b> that the people in Babylonia <b>go early</b> in the morning <b>and go late</b> in the evening <b>to the synagogue, he said: That is what was effective for them</b> in extending their lives. |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | “ Benei beliya’al have gone out from your midst | Berakhot 31b:4 | <b>“Do not take your maidservant as a wicked woman [<i>bat beliya’al</i>]</b> for out of the abundance of my complaint and anger have I spoken until now” (I Samuel 1:16). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that when a drunk person prays it is as if he engaged in idol worship</b> is derived as <b>it is written here</b> that Hannah, suspected of praying while drunk, defends herself and says: “Do not take your maidservant <b>as a <i>bat beliya’al</i>”;</b> and <b>it is written there,</b> with regard to a city that has been instigated to engage in idol worship: <b>“<i>Benei beliya’al</i> have gone out from your midst</b> and have lured the inhabitants of their city, saying let us go and serve other gods which we have not known” (Deuteronomy 13:14). By means of this verbal analogy it is derived: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the idolatrous city, the term <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship, so too here,</b> in the case of one who prays drunk, <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | And the Torah says: “And bind up [ vetzarta ] the money in your hand” | Berakhot 47b:10 | We also learned in the mishna that if one ate <b>second tithe</b> and consecrated food that had not been redeemed, he may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara remarks: <b>It is obvious?</b> Why was it necessary for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>It was only necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they were redeemed, but not redeemed properly, i.e., second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>],</b> a silver bullion that had not been engraved. <b>And the Torah says: “And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), which the Sages interpreted as follows: <i>Vetzarta</i> refers to <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it. Consecrated property;</b> in a case <b>where he redeemed it</b> by exchanging it <b>for land instead of money, and the Torah states: “He will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). |
| Deuteronomy 15:11 | as it is stated: “For the poor shall not cease from the land” | Berakhot 34b:20 | <b>And</b> the Gemara notes that this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The only</b> difference <b>between this world and the days of the Messiah is</b> with regard to <b>servitude to</b> foreign <b>kingdoms alone.</b> While in the days of the Messiah, Israel will be independent and free from enslavement to foreign powers, the world order will remain otherwise unchanged, <b>as it is stated: “For the poor shall not cease from the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:11), which indicates that the ways of the world are set and unchanging. |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | the Lord, your God, took you out from Egypt at night” | Berakhot 9a:25 | The Gemara cites an alternative explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Elazer ben Azarya and Rabbi Akiva. <b>Rabbi Abba said: Everyone agrees that when</b> the children of <b>Israel were redeemed from Egypt</b> were given permission to leave, <b>they were redeemed only in the evening, as it is stated:</b> “In the spring <b>the Lord, your God, took you out from Egypt at night”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1). <b>And when they</b> actually <b>left, they left only during the day, as it is stated:</b> “On the fifteenth of the first month, <b>on the day after the</b> offering of the <b>Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand</b> before the eyes of Egypt” (Numbers 33:3), indicating that they actually went out during the day. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | as it is stated: “That you may remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life” | Berakhot 12b:24 | Ben Zoma derived it <b>as it is stated: “That you may remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). <b>The days of your life,</b> refers to daytime alone; however, the addition of the word all, as it is stated: <b>All the days of your life,</b> comes to add nights as well. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “Bread of affliction” | Berakhot 39b:8 | This resolution is reinforced in a unique case, as <b>Rav Pappa said: Everyone agrees that</b> while fulfilling the mitzva of eating <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover, one places the piece inside the whole and breaks. What is the reason?</b> With regard to <i>matza</i> the phrase <b>“Bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3) <b>is written,</b> and the poor typically eat their bread in pieces. Therefore, eating <i>matza</i> on Passover evening, the broken <i>matza</i> is also significant. |
| Deuteronomy 16:6 | “There you will offer the Paschal lamb, in the evening when the sun sets at the time when you left the land of Egypt” | Berakhot 9a:23 | Concerning the tannaitic dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya regarding until when the Paschal lamb may be eaten, the Gemara remarks: The dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> is parallel to</b> the dispute between <b>those <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who disagree over the same issue. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“There you will offer the Paschal lamb, in the evening when the sun sets at the time when you left the land of Egypt”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:6). Upon closer examination, it seems that this verse mentions three distinct times: In the evening, refers to the afternoon until sunset; when the sun sets, refers to the time of sunset itself; and the time when you left the land of Egypt refers to, as explained in Exodus, the early hours of the morning. Therefore it seems that these times parallel the different stages of the mitzva of the Paschal lamb, and it is regarding these details that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses the dead shall be put to death” | Berakhot 18b:3 | In contrast to the righteous, who are referred to as living even after their death, the verse states explicitly: <b>“The dead know nothing.” These are the wicked, who</b> even <b>during their lives are called dead, as</b> the prophet Ezekiel <b>said</b> in reference to a king of Israel who was alive: <b>“And you are a slain, wicked prince of Israel”</b> (Ezekiel 21:30). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses the dead shall be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). This is puzzling. As long as the accused has not been sentenced to death, he <b>is alive. Rather,</b> this person who is wicked is considered <b>dead from the outset.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | you shall not deviate | Berakhot 19b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why? Let us</b> also <b>say</b> here: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.” Rav bar Shaba interpreted this</b> prohibition, which is overridden by human dignity, <b>before Rav Kahana</b> as referring <b>to the prohibition of:</b> “According to the Torah taught to you and the ruling handed down to you, you shall do, <b>you shall not deviate</b> to the left or the right from that which they tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). The Yeshiva students <b>laughed at him,</b> as the <b>prohibition of “you shall not deviate” is by Torah law,</b> like all other Torah prohibitions. Why should human dignity override it any more than any other Torah prohibition? |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | become grain. | Berakhot 47b:1 | <b>“From all of that is given to you, you shall set apart</b> that which is the Lord’s <i>teruma</i>” (Numbers 18:29). God’s <i>teruma</i>, <i>teruma gedola</i>, must be taken from all of the Levites’ gifts. The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to require <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from grain in piles and not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This,</b> after it was threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that,</b> which remained on the stalk, <b>did not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> The verse regarding <i>teruma gedola</i> states: “The first of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4), is given to the priest. Once it is considered grain, the right of the priest takes effect and the Levite is required to separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | Come and hear: | Berakhot 19b:12 | The Gemara cites an additional proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Come and hear:</b> With regard to the laws of returning a lost object, it is stated: “You shall not see the ox of your brother or his sheep go astray and ignore them; return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). The <i>baraita</i> explains that the seemingly extraneous expression <b>and disregard them</b> must be understood to give license that <b>at times you disregard</b> lost objects <b>and at times you do not disregard them.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | There it is different, as it is written: “And disregard them,” | Berakhot 19b:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is written: “And disregard them,”</b> indicating that under certain circumstances one is permitted to disregard a lost object. In that case, there is a biblical directive that creates an exception to the prohibition: “You may not disregard” (Deuteronomy 22:3). We found a case in which human dignity overrides a Torah prohibition. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us derive</b> a general principle that human dignity takes precedence over all mitzvot in the Torah <b>from this</b> case. This possibility is rejected: <b>We do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>prohibitions</b> from <b>monetary</b> laws, and the case of the lost object merely entails a monetary loss, unlike other prohibitions. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | Rabbi Yoshiya with regard to diverse kinds, as it is written: “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds” | Berakhot 22a:13 | <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya with regard to diverse kinds, as it is written: “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> This means that <b>one</b> who sows diverse kinds <b>is not liable</b> by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat and barley and a</b> grape <b>pit with a single hand motion,</b> meaning that while sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibition of diverse kinds that applies to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | with the produce [ utevuat ] of the vineyard” | Berakhot 35a:5 | <b>And according to the one who taught: A fourth year grapevine, this</b> works out <b>well if he derives</b> this matter <b>from a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>],</b> and therefore need not derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <i>hillulim</i>. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It is stated here</b> with regard to the laws of the prohibition of fruit for the tree’s first three years: “But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, <b>so that it may increase your produce [<i>tevuato</i>];</b> I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:25). <b>And it is stated below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forfeited <b>with the produce [<i>utevuat</i>] of the vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). Based on a verbal analogy, it can be derived: <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards; so too, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the fruits of a sapling, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards.</b> Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, <b>one extra <i>hillul</i></b> remains from which to derive <b>the blessing.</b> Since he derives that the laws of fourth-year saplings apply only to grapes from the verbal analogy, he can derive the requirement to recite blessings before partaking of food from the word <i>hillulim</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | “And the man who lay with her must give | Berakhot 21b:14 | <b>And from where</b> do we know <b>that</b> the verse <b>is written with regard to a woman raped by his father? As</b> the previous section, <b>juxtaposed to it,</b> deals with the laws of rape: <b>“And the man who lay with her must give</b> her father fifty shekels…because he has violated her” (Deuteronomy 22:29). |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt” | Berakhot 21b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> him from marrying <b>a woman raped by his father and a woman seduced by his father. And Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1). The last expression, “and shall not uncover his father’s skirt,” implies that: <b>A skirt that has been seen by his father,</b> i.e., any woman who has had sexual relations with his father, <b>may not be uncovered</b> by his son, i.e., his son may not marry her. |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | Wasn’t it already stated: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; | Berakhot 28a:6 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said to him: You are forbidden to enter into the congregation. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: You are permitted to enter into the congregation. Rabban Gamliel said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord;</b> even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the congregation of the Lord forever” (Deuteronomy 23:4)? How can you permit him to enter the congregation? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Do Ammon and Moab reside in their place? Sennacherib already came and,</b> through his policy of population transfer, <b>scrambled all the nations</b> and settled other nations in place of Ammon. Consequently, the current residents of Ammon and Moab are not ethnic Ammonites and Moabites, <b>as it is stated in</b> reference to Sennacherib: <b>“I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants”</b> (Isaiah 10:13). <b>And</b> although it is conceivable that this particular convert is an ethnic Ammonite, nevertheless, there is no need for concern due to the halakhic principle: <b>Anything that parts</b> from a group <b>parts from the majority,</b> and the assumption is that he is from the majority of nations whose members are permitted to enter the congregation. |
| Deuteronomy 23:6 | but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you” | Berakhot 55b:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Three transformations:</b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing;</b><br><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12);<br><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together;</b><br><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12);<br>and: <b>“Nevertheless the Lord your God would not hearken unto Balaam;</b><br><b>but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). |
| Deuteronomy 23:8 | “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land” | Berakhot 63b:22 | <b>Rabbi Yosei began</b> to speak <b>in honor of the hosts, and taught:</b> It is said: <b>“You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as the Egyptians, who only befriended Israel,</b> even when they hosted them, <b>for their own benefit,</b> as Pharaoh said to Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle”</b> (Genesis 47:6), are treated <b>this way, all the more so</b> should <b>one who hosts a Torah scholar in his home, providing him with food and drink and availing him of his possessions</b> without concern for personal gain, be treated this way. |
| Deuteronomy 23:13 | it is written: “You shall also have a place outside the camp, to which you will go” | Berakhot 25a:15 | <b>And in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, as Rabbi Yonatan</b> raised a <b>contradiction</b> between two verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “You shall also have a place outside the camp, to which you will go”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:13), meaning that one must exit the camp before attending to his bodily needs but there is no obligation to cover it; <b>and it is written</b> in another verse: <b>“And you shall have a spade</b> among your weapons; and when you ease yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and turn back <b>and cover your excrement”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:14), indicating a clear obligation to conceal one’s excrement. |

| Deuteronomy 24:16 | and children shall not be put to death for the fathers; | Berakhot 7a:26 | The Gemara expands upon these righteous and wicked individuals: <b>The Master said: The righteous</b> person <b>who prospers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a righteous</b> person. <b>The righteous</b> person <b>who suffers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a wicked</b> person. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it so</b> that one is always punished for his ancestors’ transgressions? <b>Isn’t it written: “He visits iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</b> and upon the children’s children, unto the third and fourth generations” (Exodus 34:7). <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: “Fathers shall not die for their children, <b>and children shall not be put to death for the fathers;</b> every man shall die for his own transgression” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between the two verses.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied” | Berakhot 35b:12 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> bringing it into the <b>courtyard determines</b> its status as having completed the production process and obligates the produce to be tithed, <b>as it is written</b> in the confession of the tithes: “And I have given to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan and the widow, <b>and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | “I have removed the consecrated from the house” | Berakhot 35b:11 | Along these lines, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi El’ai: Come and see that the latter generations are not like the earlier generations.</b> In the <b>earlier generations,</b> people <b>would bring their fruits into their courtyards through the main gate in order to obligate them in tithes.</b> However, <b>the latter generations bring their fruits through roofs, through courtyards and through enclosed courtyards,</b> avoiding the main gate <b>in order to exempt them from</b> the mitzva of <b>tithing.

| Deuteronomy 26:13 | “I did not transgress your mitzvot and I did not forget” | Berakhot 40b:10 | The Gemara considers <b>the matter</b> of Rav’s opinion <b>itself</b> and cites the fundamental dispute in that regard. <b>Rav said: Any blessing that does not contain mention of God’s name is not</b> considered a <b>blessing. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any blessing that does not contain mention of</b> God’s <b>sovereignty is not</b> considered a <b>blessing. Abaye said: It stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: In the confession of the tithes, one recites, <b>“I did not transgress your mitzvot and I did not forget”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13). The meaning of phrase, <b>I did not transgress,</b> is that I did not refrain <b>from blessing You</b> when separating tithes; and the meaning of the phrase, <b>and I did not forget,</b> is that I did not forget <b>to mention Your name in</b> the blessing recited <b>over it. However, this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>did not teach</b> that one must mention God’s <b>sovereignty</b> in the blessing. |
| Deuteronomy 26:19 | “And to elevate you | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation,</b> to whom God is close, like the Lord our God whenever we call upon Him?” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation,</b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today?” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel,</b> who is like you? A people saved by the Lord, the shield of your help, and that is the sword of your excellence. And your enemies shall dwindle away before you, and you shall tread upon their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29); <b>“Or has God attempted</b> to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders” (Deuteronomy 4:34); <b>“And to elevate you</b> above all nations that He has made, in praise, in name and in glory; that you may be a holy people to the Lord, your God, as He has spoken” (Deuteronomy 26:19). |
| Deuteronomy 27:9 | as it is written: “Pay attention, and hear, Israel” | Berakhot 15b:15 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> as to whether or not a deaf person fulfills his obligation <b>is</b> only <b>in</b> the case of <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, but with regard to the rest of the mitzvot, everyone agrees that he does not fulfill</b> his obligation if he does not hear his recitation, <b>as it is written: “Pay attention, and hear, Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:9); meaning that one is required to listen and hear. |
| Deuteronomy 27:9 | it says: “Pay attention, and hear [ shema ], Israel” | Berakhot 16a:10 | <b>Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, raised a contradiction before Rava: We learned</b> in our mishna: <b>Laborers may recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>atop the tree or atop the course of stones</b> in a wall under construction. <b>We see that he does not require intent,</b> simple recitation is sufficient. <b>And he raised a contradiction</b> from the verbal analogy taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> must focus his heart, as it is stated: “Hear [<i>Shema</i>], Israel.” And below,</b> later in Deuteronomy, <b>it says: “Pay attention, and hear [<i>shema</i>], Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:9). <b>Just as there</b> one must <b>pay attention, so too here</b> one must <b>pay attention.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:9 | “Keep silence [ hasket ] and hear, Israel; this day you have become a people | Berakhot 63b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda again began</b> to speak <b>in honor of Torah and taught:</b> When Moses took leave of Israel on his last day in this world, he said: <b>“Keep silence [<i>hasket</i>] and hear, Israel; this day you have become a people</b> unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 27:9). This is surprising: <b>Was the Torah given to Israel on that day?

| Deuteronomy 28:10 | “All the peoples of the earth shall see | Berakhot 56a:8 | They said to him: The verse: <b>“All the peoples of the earth shall see</b> that the name of the Lord is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said: Your name will become well-known as head of the yeshiva, and you will be feared by all.

| Deuteronomy 28:10 | don phylacteries in a dream should anticipate greatness, as it is stated: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you; | Berakhot 57a:3 | <b>One who</b> sees himself <b>don phylacteries in a dream should anticipate greatness, as it is stated: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you;</b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: That the Name of the Lord is called upon you, refers to phylacteries of the head,</b> as they represent God’s name upon man. <b>One who</b> sees himself <b>pray in a dream,</b> it is <b>an auspicious omen.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where he saw in the dream that he <b>had not</b> yet <b>finished</b> his prayer and is therefore still close to God. If, in the dream, he had already finished his prayer, it is not an omen. |
| Deuteronomy 28:10 | that phylacteries provide strength for Israel?

| Deuteronomy 28:48 | others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy | Berakhot 35b:7 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Is it possible that a person plows in the plowing season and sows in the sowing season and harvests in the harvest season and threshes in the threshing season and winnows in the windy season,</b> as grain is separated from the chaff by means of the wind, and is constantly busy; <b>what will become of Torah? Rather,</b> one must dedicate himself exclusively to Torah at the expense of other endeavors; as <b>when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks,</b> and foreigners will be your plowmen and your vinedressers” (Isaiah 61:5). <b>When Israel does not perform God’s will, their work is performed by them</b> themselves, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall gather your grain.” Moreover,</b> if Israel fails to perform God’s will, <b>others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy</b> whom God shall send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness and in want of all things” (Deuteronomy 28:48). |
| Deuteronomy 28:66 | “And your life shall hang in doubt before you [ minneged ]” | Berakhot 24a:19 | Moreover, <b>the Symbolic Interpreters</b> of the Torah <b>said</b> that the verse: <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you [<i>minneged</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:66), that is the punishment of <b>one who hangs his phylacteries.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:69 | covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant” | Berakhot 5a:19 | <b>And that is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, and</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions.</b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, as it is written: “The salt of the covenant</b> with your God <b>should not be excluded</b> from your meal-offering; with all your sacrifices you must offer salt” (Leviticus 2:13). <b>And</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:69). <b>Just as,</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to salt, the salt sweetens</b> the taste of <b>the meat</b> and renders it edible, <b>so too</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to suffering, the suffering cleanses a person’s transgressions,</b> purifying him for a more sublime existence. |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | “It is your life and the length of your days” | Berakhot 55a:8 | The Gemara details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the <b>Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written</b> of the Torah: <b>“It is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who conducts himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,</b> as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? <b>Because he conducted himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority,</b> and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died. |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days” | Berakhot 61b:7 | Rabbi Akiva <b>answered him: I will relate a parable. To what can this be compared?</b> It is like <b>a fox walking along a riverbank when he sees fish gathering</b> and fleeing <b>from place to place.</b> <br>The fox <b>said to them: From what are you fleeing?</b> <br><b>They said to him:</b> We are fleeing <b>from the nets that people cast upon us.</b> <br><b>He said to them: Do you wish to come up onto dry land, and we will reside together just as my ancestors resided with your ancestors?</b> <br>The fish <b>said to him: You are the one of whom they say, he is the cleverest of animals? You are not clever; you are a fool. If we are afraid in</b> the water, <b>our</b> natural <b>habitat</b> which gives us <b>life,</b> then <b>in a habitat</b> that causes our <b>death, all the more so.</b> <br>The moral is: <b>So too, we</b> Jews, <b>now that we sit and engage in Torah</b> study, <b>about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20), we fear the empire <b>to this extent; if we proceed to</b> sit <b>idle from its</b> study, as its abandonment is the habitat that causes our death, <b>all the more so</b> will we fear the empire. |
| Deuteronomy 31:20 | from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn | Berakhot 32a:12 | On a similar note, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: That is what people say</b> in a popular maxim: <b>Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me”</b> (Hosea 13:6). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This principle is derived not from the verse in Hosea, but <b>from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14). <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn</b> to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:20). |
| Deuteronomy 32:3 | As it is stated: “When I proclaim the Lord’s name, give glory to our God” | Berakhot 21a:4 | And <b>from where is</b> the mitzva <b>by Torah law</b> to recite <b>the blessing over the Torah before it</b> is read, derived? <b>As it is stated: “When I proclaim the Lord’s name, give glory to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3), meaning that before one proclaims the Lord’s name by reading the Torah, he must give glory to God. |
| Deuteronomy 32:3 | praise to our God” | Berakhot 45a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the basic mitzva of <i>zimmun</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived<b>,</b> that after a meal in which three diners participated, a <i>zimmun</i> must be recited? <b>Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together”</b> (Psalms 34:4), i.e., the one reciting the blessing turns to at least two others to praise God together. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The source of the mitzva of <i>zimmun</i> is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>here: “When I call the Name of the Lord, give</b> [plural] <b>praise to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3). |
| Deuteronomy 32:6 | his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you, | Berakhot 35b:2 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel. |
| Deuteronomy 32:15 | from here: “And Jeshurun grew fat and kicked” | Berakhot 32a:13 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “And Jeshurun grew fat and kicked”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:15). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> in the Torah is it derived that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, ultimately conceded to Moses</b> that the reason for the sin of the Golden Calf was indeed the riches lavished upon Israel? <b>As it is stated: “And I gave them an abundance of silver and gold, which they used for the Ba’al”</b> (Hosea 2:10). |
| Deuteronomy 32:18 | And Rock means nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Of the Rock that gave birth to you, you have been unmindful, | Berakhot 5b:26 | <b>Not only that, but it causes the Divine Presence to remove itself from Israel, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“The Rock will be moved from its place.”</b> The rock, God, is forced to remove His presence. <b>And Rock means nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Of the Rock that gave birth to you, you have been unmindful,</b> and you have forgotten God Who bore you” (Deuteronomy 32:18). |
| Deuteronomy 32:24 | nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [ reshef ] and bitter destruction [ ketev meriri ], | Berakhot 5a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> upon his bed, demons stay away from him.</b> This is alluded to, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But man is born into trouble, <b>and the sparks [<i>reshef</i> ] fly [<i>uf</i> ] upward”</b> (Job 5:7). The verse is explained: The word <b>fly [<i>uf</i> ]</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah,</b> as Torah is difficult to grasp and easy to lose, like something that floats away, <b>as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone;</b> for riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies into the heavens” (Proverbs 23:5). The word <b>“sparks”</b> means <b>nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [<i>reshef</i>] and bitter destruction [<i>ketev meriri</i>],</b> and the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of the dust” (Deuteronomy 32:24). Here we see <i>reshef</i> listed along with <i>ketev meriri</i>, both of which are understood by the Sages to be names of demons. |
| Deuteronomy 32:32 | “Their grapes are grapes of gall, | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite:</b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall,</b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Deuteronomy 32:47 | what is his reward? Rabbi Abbahu said: Of him the verse says: “And it is through this matter that you will prolong your days” | Berakhot 24b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>And if he stopped</b> his recitation, <b>what is his reward? Rabbi Abbahu said: Of him the verse says: “And it is through this matter that you will prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:47), meaning that by being careful with one’s speech one merits longevity. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | for good, as it is written: “He shined forth from Mount Paran” | Berakhot 33a:23 | <b>He said to him: Yes. At least in its place,</b> in the appropriate context, <b>it is great.</b> At times it is necessary. <b>That is that which Ulla said: Why</b> are <b>these two vengeances</b> mentioned in a single verse? <b>One for good and one for evil.</b> Vengeance <b>for good, as it is written: “He shined forth from Mount Paran”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2) with regard to God’s vengeance against the wicked; vengeance <b>for evil, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth”</b> with regard to the punishment of Israel. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them” | Berakhot 62a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why must one not wipe</b> himself <b>with his right</b> hand, <b>but with his left? Rava said: Because the Torah was given with the right</b> hand, <b>as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Because</b> the right hand <b>is close to the mouth,</b> i.e., people eat with the right hand. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Because one ties the phylacteries</b> onto his left hand <b>with</b> his right hand. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Because one points to the</b> cantillation <b>notes of the Torah with</b> his right hand. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | “From His right hand, a fiery law for His people” | Berakhot 6a:18 | Specifically, <b>“His right hand” refers to the Torah, as it is stated</b> in describing the giving of the Torah: <b>“From His right hand, a fiery law for His people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>“The arm of His strength,”</b> His left hand, <b>refers to phylacteries, as it is stated: “The Lord gave strength to His nation”</b> (Psalms 29:11), in the form of the mitzva of phylacteries. |
| Deuteronomy 33:4 | he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [ morasha ] of the congregation of Jacob” | Berakhot 57a:4 | <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with his mother [<i>em</i>] in a dream, he should anticipate</b> attaining <b>understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [<i>im</i>] you call for understanding”</b> (Proverbs 2:3), and in this homiletic interpretation <i>im</i> is considered to be the equivalent of <i>em</i>. <b>One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with a betrothed young woman</b> in a dream, <b>he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [<i>morasha</i>] of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>morasha</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>me’orasa</i>, betrothed. One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with a married woman in a dream is assured that he is one</b> who has a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> He receives his place as well as that of another person in the Garden of Eden, as the married woman represents a portion belonging to someone else. However, the Gemara adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where <b>he did not know her and was not thinking about her that evening;</b> rather, he saw an unidentified woman in his dream by chance. |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | rise early and recite: “His firstling bullock, majesty is his” | Berakhot 56b:15 | <b>One who sees an ox in a dream,</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “His firstling bullock, majesty is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“And if an ox gore a man”</b> (Exodus 21:28). |
| Deuteronomy 33:23 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who recites a blessing over a full cup, they give him a boundless inheritance, as it is stated: “And full of the blessing of the Lord, possess the sea and the south” | Berakhot 51a:18 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who recites a blessing over a full cup, they give him a boundless inheritance, as it is stated: “And full of the blessing of the Lord, possess the sea and the south”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:23), indicating that one whose cup is full will receive God’s blessing and will inherit from all sides. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He merits and inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:29 | “Happy are you, Israel, | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation,</b> to whom God is close, like the Lord our God whenever we call upon Him?” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation,</b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today?” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel,</b> who is like you? A people saved by the Lord, the shield of your help, and that is the sword of your excellence. And your enemies shall dwindle away before you, and you shall tread upon their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29); <b>“Or has God attempted</b> to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders” (Deuteronomy 4:34); <b>“And to elevate you</b> above all nations that He has made, in praise, in name and in glory; that you may be a holy people to the Lord, your God, as He has spoken” (Deuteronomy 26:19). |
| Deuteronomy 34:4 | that the dead converse with each other? As it is stated: “And the Lord said to him, this is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: | Berakhot 18b:17 | In any case, with regard to the crux of the issue, <b>Rabbi Yonatan also reconsidered</b> his opinion, <b>as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the dead converse with each other? As it is stated: “And the Lord said to him, this is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying:</b> I will give it to your offspring” (Deuteronomy 34:4). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“saying”?</b> It means that <b>God told Moses: Go and tell Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</b> that <b>the oath that I swore to you I have already fulfilled for your descendants.</b> |
| Joshua 1:7 | “Only be strong and be extremely courageous, observe and do all of the Torah | Berakhot 32b:12 | For each of these, a biblical proof is cited: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Torah and good deeds</b> require bolstering? <b>As it is stated</b> in the instruction to Joshua: <b>“Only be strong and be extremely courageous, observe and do all of the Torah</b> that Moses My servant commanded you; do not deviate to the right or to the left, that you may succeed wherever you go” (Joshua 1:7). In this verse, observe refers to Torah study and do refers to good deeds (Maharsha); the apparently repetitive language is not extraneous. The Gemara derives: <b>Be strong in Torah and be courageous in good deeds.</b> |
| Joshua 1:8 | the verse states: “And you shall gather your grain”? Because it is stated: “This Torah shall not depart from your mouths, | Berakhot 35b:6 | <b>The Sages taught: What</b> is the meaning of that which <b>the verse states: “And you shall gather your grain”? Because it is stated: “This Torah shall not depart from your mouths,</b> and you shall contemplate in it day and night” (Joshua 1:8), <b>I might</b> have thought <b>that these matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written;</b> one is to literally spend his days immersed exclusively in Torah study. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall gather your grain,</b> your wine and your oil,” <b>assume in their</b> regard, <b>the way of the world;</b> set aside time not only for Torah, but also for work. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Joshua 2:6 | “She had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the trees of flax” | Berakhot 43b:1 | <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Over this jasmine [<i>simlak</i>], one recites: Who creates fragrant trees. Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Over these spikenards,</b> which grow next to <b>the sea, one recites: Who creates fragrant trees. Mar Zutra said: What is the verse</b> from which we derive that even a plant with soft stalks can be called a tree? From the verse: <b>“She had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the trees of flax”</b> (Joshua 2:6); evidently, even stalks of flax are called “trees.” |
| Joshua 3:17 | the crossings of the Jordan, as it is stated: “The priests who bore the ark of God’s covenant stood on dry land within the Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry land until the entire nation finished crossing the Jordan” | Berakhot 54a:15 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted,</b> the miracles at <b>the crossings of the sea</b> are recorded explicitly in the Torah, <b>as it is stated: “And the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground</b> and the water was a wall for them on their right and on their left” (Exodus 14:22). So too, the miracle at <b>the crossings of the Jordan, as it is stated: “The priests who bore the ark of God’s covenant stood on dry land within the Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry land until the entire nation finished crossing the Jordan”</b> (Joshua 3:17). |
| Joshua 6:20 | Didn’t they fall, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the shofar , that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat” | Berakhot 54b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> also taught that we recite a blessing for <b>the wall of Jericho that was swallowed</b> up in its place. The Gemara asks: <b>Were the walls of Jericho swallowed up</b> into the ground? <b>Didn’t they fall, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat”</b> (Joshua 6:20)? The Gemara explains: <b>Since the width and height</b> of the walls <b>were equal to one another, therefore, they were swallowed.</b> Had they merely fallen it would have had no effect, as their width was equal to their height. |
| Joshua 6:20 | And the wall of Jericho that was swallowed, as it is written: “And the wall fell down flat” | Berakhot 54b:8 | <b>And</b> one must recite a blessing upon seeing <b>Lot’s wife, as it is stated: “But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt”</b> (Genesis 19:26). <b>And the wall of Jericho that was swallowed, as it is written: “And the wall fell down flat”</b> (Joshua 6:20). |
| Joshua 10:11 | “As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beit Ḥoron, that the Lord cast down great stones | Berakhot 54b:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in the midrash: They are the <b>stones that</b> remained <b>suspended</b> in the air and did not fall <b>because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>] and they fell down because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They</b> remained <b>suspended because of a man; that is Moses,</b> whom the verse refers to as a man, <b>as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest”</b> (Numbers 12:3), <b>and it is written:</b> “And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the Lord; <b>the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth”</b> (Exodus 9:33). Moses’ hailstones remained suspended. And the stones <b>descended because of a man; that is Joshua,</b> who was also called man, <b>as it is written: “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit”</b> (Numbers 27:18). <b>And it is written</b> that when Joshua and his people waged war against the army of the Emorite kings, God told him not to fear them because God would deliver them into his hands; and indeed, they died by means of these stones: <b>“As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beit Ḥoron, that the Lord cast down great stones</b> from heaven upon them unto Azeka, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew by sword” (Joshua 10:11). |
| Joshua 10:13 | And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Judges 5:20 | For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Judges 6:12 | and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor” | Berakhot 54a:9 | The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah. |
| Judges 6:12 | “The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor” | Berakhot 63a:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>And if you say: Boaz said this on his own,</b> and it proves nothing with regard to normative practice, <b>come and hear</b> a proof from the verse: <b>“The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it was an angel who said</b> this <b>to Gideon,</b> that perhaps this verse was the angel informing Gideon that the Lord is with him, but it is not the standard formula of a greeting, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the verse: <b>“And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22); the customs of the nation’s elders are an adequate source from which to derive <i>halakha</i>. |
| Judges 7:19 | What is Rabbi Natan’s reasoning? As it is written: “And Gideon, and the one hundred men who were with him, came to the edge of camp at the beginning of the middle watch” | Berakhot 3b:11 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is Rabbi Natan’s reasoning? As it is written: “And Gideon, and the one hundred men who were with him, came to the edge of camp at the beginning of the middle watch”</b> (Judges 7:19). <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Middle means nothing other than</b> that <b>there is one before it and one after it.</b> From the fact that the verse refers to a middle watch, the fact that the night is comprised of three watches may be inferred. |
| Judges 8:33 | went astray after the Be’alim” | Berakhot 12b:22 | In response, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> where these elements were derived from allusions in the verse, “You shall stray neither after your hearts nor after your eyes, after which you would lust” (Numbers 15:39). <b>As it was taught: “After your hearts” refers to</b> following opinions <b>of heresy</b> that may arise in one’s heart. The Gemara offers a proof, <b>as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’;</b> they have been corrupt, they have acted abominably; there is none who does good” (Psalms 14:1). The phrase: <b>“After your eyes,”</b> in <b>this</b> verse refers to following <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, that a person might see and desire, <b>as it is stated: “And Samson said to his father, ‘That one take for me, for she is upright in my eyes’”</b> (Judges 14:3). The passage: <b>“You shall stray after”</b> refers to promiscuity, which in the parlance of the prophets is a metaphor for <b>idol worship, as it is stated:</b> “The children of Israel again <b>went astray after the Be’alim”</b> (Judges 8:33). |
| Judges 9:13 | As it is stated: “And the vine replied: Should I leave my wine, which gladdens God and man, | Berakhot 35a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> did <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Sanctified for praises,” come for that</b> purpose? <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to derive other matters. <b>One</b> being <b>that the Merciful One said: Redeem it and then eat it.</b> This midrash interprets <i>hillul</i>, praise, as <i>ḥillul</i>, redemption. <b>And the other</b> matter derived from this verse is: <b>An object which</b> is offered upon the altar and <b>requires a song</b> of praise when it is offered, as is the case with the libation of wine, <b>requires redemption. And that which does not require a song</b> of praise, all other fruits, <b>does not require redemption. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>one only recites a song</b> of praise in the Temple <b>over the</b> libation of <b>wine</b> on the altar? <b>As it is stated: “And the vine replied: Should I leave my wine, which gladdens God and man,</b> and go and wave above the trees?” (Judges 9:13). <b>If</b> wine <b>gladdens people, in what</b> way <b>does it gladden God?</b> Rather, derive <b>from here that one only recites a song</b> of praise <b>over wine,</b> as wine gladdens God when offered as part of the service in the Temple.In any case, other <i>halakhot</i> have been derived from this verse. From where, then, is the requirement to recite blessings derived? |
| Judges 13:11 | Manoah, was an ignoramus, as it is written: “And Manoah…went after his wife” | Berakhot 61a:22 | <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> From the following verse we know that Samson’s father, <b>Manoah, was an ignoramus, as it is written: “And Manoah…went after his wife”</b> (Judges 13:11). |
| Judges 14:3 | as it is stated: “And Samson said to his father, ‘That one take for me, for she is upright in my eyes’” | Berakhot 12b:22 | In response, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> where these elements were derived from allusions in the verse, “You shall stray neither after your hearts nor after your eyes, after which you would lust” (Numbers 15:39). <b>As it was taught: “After your hearts” refers to</b> following opinions <b>of heresy</b> that may arise in one’s heart.

| Judges 15:5 | kerem ; as it is written: “And burnt up from the shocks and the standing grain and the olive yards [ kerem zayit ]” | Berakhot 35a:14 | The Gemara questions this point: <b>Is an olive derived from</b> the fact that it <b>has an aspect</b> of being offered upon the <b>altar? Isn’t it written explicitly with regard to</b> the olive <b>listed</b> that the orchard in which it grows is called <b><i>kerem</i>; as it is written: “And burnt up from the shocks and the standing grain and the olive yards [<i>kerem zayit</i>]”</b> (Judges 15:5)? Just as the orchard in which grapes grow is called <i>kerem</i>, and grapes require a blessing, the olive also grows in a <i>kerem</i> and should require a blessing. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Nevertheless, an analogy may not be drawn between the two; where the olive grows <b>is called <i>kerem zayit</i>, it is not called <i>kerem</i> unmodified,</b> which is a term reserved for grapevines. |
| Judges 16:17 | “If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak” | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Ruth 2:4 | as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you” | Berakhot 54a:9 | The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah. |
| 1 Samuel 1:10 | as the verse states: “And she felt bitterness of soul, | Berakhot 30b:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that prayer should be undertaken in an atmosphere of gravity. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? Rabbi Elazar said: They are derived from the verses describing the prayer of Hannah, mother of Samuel, <b>as the verse states: “And she felt bitterness of soul,</b> and she prayed to the Lord and she wept and wept” (I Samuel 1:10). |
| 1 Samuel 1:11 | not forget Your maidservant and will give Your maidservant” | Berakhot 31b:14 | In the oath/prayer uttered by Hannah, she refers to herself as “Your servant” [<i>amatekha</i>] three times: <b>“The affliction of Your maidservant…</b>and <b>not forget Your maidservant and will give Your maidservant”</b> (I Samuel 1:11). |
| 1 Samuel 1:11 | “And she swore an oath and said, Lord of Hosts [ Tzeva’ot ] | Berakhot 31b:6 | Incidental to this discussion of Hannah’s prayer, the Gemara explores related topics. In her prayer, Hannah said: <b>“And she swore an oath and said, Lord of Hosts [<i>Tzeva’ot</i>]</b> if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant and will give Your maidservant a male child, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall be no razor come upon his head” (I Samuel 1:11). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From the day that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created His world, there was no person who called the Holy One, Blessed be He, Lord of Hosts until Hannah came and called Him Lord of Hosts.</b> This is the first time in the Bible that God is referred to by this name. |
| 1 Samuel 1:13 | and her voice could not be heard” | Berakhot 31a:24 | Furthermore, <b>I might have</b> thought <b>that one may make his voice heard in his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer; it has already been articulated by Hannah</b> in her prayer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved <b>and her voice could not be heard”</b> (I Samuel 1:13). |
| 1 Samuel 1:13 | of Hannah? | Berakhot 31a:27 | <b>Rav Hamnuna said: How many significant</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>can be derived from these verses</b> of the prayer <b>of Hannah?</b> As it says: “And Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved and her voice could not be heard, so Eli thought her to be drunk” (I Samuel 1:13). The Gemara elaborates: <b>From</b> that which is stated <b>here: “And Hannah spoke in her heart,”</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one who prays must focus his heart</b> on his prayer is derived. And <b>from</b> that which is stated <b>here: “Only her lips moved,”</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one who prays must enunciate</b> the words <b>with his lips,</b> not only contemplate them in his heart, is derived. <b>From</b> that which is written <b>here: “And her voice could not be heard,”</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one is forbidden to raise his voice in his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> as it must be recited silently. <b>From</b> the continuation of the verse <b>here: “So Eli thought her to be drunk,”</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a drunk person is forbidden to pray.</b> That is why he rebuked her. |
| 1 Samuel 1:14 | “And Eli said to her: How long will you remain drunk? | Berakhot 31a:28 | On the subject of Eli’s rebuke of Hannah, as it is stated: <b>“And Eli said to her: How long will you remain drunk?</b> Remove your wine from yourself” (I Samuel 1:14); <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one who sees in another</b> |
| 1 Samuel 1:15 | “And Hannah answered and she said no, my master, | Berakhot 31b:1 | <b>an unseemly matter, he must reprimand him,</b> is derived. <b>“And Hannah answered and she said no, my master,</b> I am a woman of sorrowful spirit, and I have drunk neither wine nor liquor, but I pour out my soul before the Lord” (I Samuel 1:15). Regarding the words: “No, my master,” <b>Ulla, and some say Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that <b>she said to him,</b> in an allusion: <b>With regard to this matter, you are not a master, and the Divine Spirit does not rest upon you, as you</b> falsely <b>suspect me of this.</b> |
| 1 Samuel 1:16 | “Do not take your maidservant as a wicked woman [ bat beliya’al ] | Berakhot 31b:4 | <b>“Do not take your maidservant as a wicked woman [<i>bat beliya’al</i>]</b> for out of the abundance of my complaint and anger have I spoken until now” (I Samuel 1:16). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that when a drunk person prays it is as if he engaged in idol worship</b> is derived as <b>it is written here</b> that Hannah, suspected of praying while drunk, defends herself and says: “Do not take your maidservant <b>as a <i>bat beliya’al</i>”;</b> and <b>it is written there,</b> with regard to a city that has been instigated to engage in idol worship: <b>“<i>Benei beliya’al</i> have gone out from your midst</b> and have lured the inhabitants of their city, saying let us go and serve other gods which we have not known” (Deuteronomy 13:14). By means of this verbal analogy it is derived: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the idolatrous city, the term <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship, so too here,</b> in the case of one who prays drunk, <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship.</b> |
| 1 Samuel 1:17 | “And Eli answered and said: May you go in peace” | Berakhot 31b:5 | The verse continues: <b>“And Eli answered and said: May you go in peace”</b> (I Samuel 1:17). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>that one who suspects another of something that he has not</b> done, <b>he must appease him. Moreover,</b> the one who suspected him <b>must bless him,</b> as Eli continued and offered Hannah a blessing, <b>as it is stated: “And may the God of Israel grant your request</b> that you have asked of Him” (I Samuel 1:17). |
| 1 Samuel 1:25 | as it is stated: “And they slaughtered the cow and they brought the youth to Eli” | Berakhot 31b:20 | Additionally, Hannah’s emphasis in speaking to Eli, <b>“for this youth I prayed”</b> (I Samuel 1:27), indicates that she came to protect him from danger. As <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Samuel was</b> one who <b>taught <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher.</b> Hannah wanted to pray that he not be punished by death at the hand of Heaven for his transgression, <b>as it is stated: “And they slaughtered the cow and they brought the youth to Eli”</b> (I Samuel 1:25). This verse is puzzling. <b>Because they slaughtered the cow,</b> therefore, <b>they brought the youth to Eli?</b> What does one have to do with the next? |
| 1 Samuel 1:26 | I am the woman who stood here with you | Berakhot 31b:19 | When Hannah came to the Temple with her son Samuel, she told Eli: “My lord, as your soul lives, my lord, <b>I am the woman who stood here with you</b> to pray to the Lord” (I Samuel 1:26). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of</b> one who is <b>praying</b> is derived. As the verse says: “Who stood here with you,” indicating that Eli stood alongside Hannah because she was praying. |
| 1 Samuel 1:27 | “for this youth I prayed” | Berakhot 31b:20 | Additionally, Hannah’s emphasis in speaking to Eli, <b>“for this youth I prayed”</b> (I Samuel 1:27), indicates that she came to protect him from danger. As <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Samuel was</b> one who <b>taught <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher.</b> Hannah wanted to pray that he not be punished by death at the hand of Heaven for his transgression, <b>as it is stated: “And they slaughtered the cow and they brought the youth to Eli”</b> (I Samuel 1:25). This verse is puzzling. <b>Because they slaughtered the cow,</b> therefore, <b>they brought the youth to Eli?</b> What does one have to do with the next? |
| 1 Samuel 2:2 | “There is none holy like the Lord, for there is none like You, and there is no Rock like our God” | Berakhot 10a:21 | Other interpretations of this verse exist. The Gemara relates how <b>Rav Shimi bar Ukva, and some say Mar Ukva, would regularly</b> study <b>before Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi,</b> who was well versed in <i>aggada</i> and <b>would arrange the <i>aggada</i> before Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> <br>Once, Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi <b>said to him: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Bless the Lord, my soul, and all that is within me bless His Holy name”?</b> <br>Rav Shimi bar Ukva <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi: <b>Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like the attribute of flesh and blood,</b> as this verse praises the formation of man in his mother’s womb. <b>The attribute of flesh and blood is</b> such that he <b>shapes a form on the wall</b> for all to see, yet <b>he cannot instill it with a spirit and soul, bowels and intestines.</b> While <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not so,</b> as God <b>shapes one form within another form,</b> a child in its mother’s womb, <b>and instills it with spirit and soul, bowels and intestines. And this is</b> the explanation of <b>what Hannah said</b> with regard to the birth of Samuel: <b>“There is none holy like the Lord, for there is none like You, and there is no Rock like our God”</b> (I Samuel 2:2). |
| 1 Samuel 2:3 | as it is stated: “For God of knowledge is the Lord” | Berakhot 33a:19 | <b>And Rav Ami said</b> in praise of knowledge: <b>Great is knowledge that was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated: “For God of knowledge is the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>And</b> since knowledge is regarded so highly, <b>anyone without knowledge, it is forbidden to have compassion upon him, as it is stated: “For they are a people of no wisdom, so their Creator will have no compassion upon them</b> and their Creator will not be gracious unto them” (Isaiah 27:11). If God shows no mercy for those who lack wisdom, all the more so should people refrain from doing so. |
| 1 Samuel 2:10 | correspond to the nine mentions of God’s name that Hannah said in her prayer | Berakhot 29a:11 | The Gemara asks further: <b>Corresponding to what</b> were <b>these nine</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>Rosh HaShana</b> additional prayer instituted? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of Kartignin said:</b> They <b>correspond to the nine mentions of God’s name that Hannah said in her prayer</b> (I Samuel 2:10). The connection between Hannah’s prayer and Rosh HaShana is based on what <b>the Master said: On Rosh HaShana, Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered</b> and the divine decree that they would conceive their sons was issued. |
| 1 Samuel 7:17 | As it is stated: “And he returned to Rama, for there was his house, | Berakhot 10b:21 | <b>Abaye, and some say Rabbi Yitzḥak, said:</b> A great man <b>who seeks to enjoy</b> the contributions of those who seek to honor him <b>may enjoy</b> those gifts, <b>as Elisha</b> enjoyed gifts given him by the woman from Shunem, among others. <b>And one who does not seek to enjoy</b> these gifts <b>should not enjoy them, as</b> was the practice of the prophet <b>Samuel from Rama,</b> who would not accept gifts from anyone at all. From where do we know that this was Samuel’s custom? <b>As it is stated: “And he returned to Rama, for there was his house,</b> and there he judged Israel, and he built an altar to the Lord” (I Samuel 7:17). <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Every place where</b> Samuel <b>went, his house was with him,</b> so he would have everything that he needed and not be forced to benefit from public contributions. One may opt to conduct himself in accordance with either of these paths. |
| 1 Samuel 9:2 | he was taller than the people from the shoulders up” | Berakhot 48b:9 | Tangentially, the Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did these maidens go on <b>so expansively</b> while speaking to Saul? <b>It is because women are chatterers. And Shmuel said</b> a different reason: They spoke expansively <b>in order to gaze upon Saul’s beauty</b> longer, <b>as it is written</b> about him: “An excellent young man; no one among the Israelites was better than he; <b>he was taller than the people from the shoulders up”</b> (I Samuel 9:2). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that their expansiveness was initiated by God, because <b>one sovereignty does not overlap with its counterpart, even</b> one <b>hairbreadth.</b> Saul’s coronation was delayed so that Samuel’s leadership would not be curtailed. |
| 1 Samuel 9:13 | “As soon you come into the city, find him right away, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he will bless the sacrifice; and afterwards all those who are invited will eat; | Berakhot 48b:8 | <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> That source for the obligation to recite a blessing beforehand <b>is not necessary, as it says</b> when the maidens told Saul: <b>“As soon you come into the city, find him right away, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he will bless the sacrifice; and afterwards all those who are invited will eat;</b> now go, for you shall find him at this time of day” (I Samuel 9:13). A blessing recited prior to eating is explicitly mentioned in that verse. |
| 1 Samuel 12:23 | “As for me, far be it from me that I should transgress against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you, | Berakhot 12b:6 | <b>And Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava said in the name of Rav: Anyone who can ask for mercy on behalf of another, and does not ask is called a sinner, as it is stated</b> following Samuel’s rebuke of the people: <b>“As for me, far be it from me that I should transgress against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,</b> but I will teach you the good and the right way” (I Samuel 12:23). Had Samuel refrained from prayer, he would have committed a sin. |
| 1 Samuel 14:45 | “The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation | Berakhot 55b:9 | <b>And three redemptions, as it is written:</b><br><b>“He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me;</b> for they were many that strove with me” (Psalms 55:19);<br><b>“The redeemed of the Lord shall return,</b> and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;<br>they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35:10);<br>and: <b>“The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation</b> in Israel?<br>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not” (I Samuel 14:45). |
| 1 Samuel 15:6 | that which is written: “And Saul said unto the Kenites: Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites lest I destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt” | Berakhot 63b:21 | The Gemara returns to the homilies offered by the Sages in the vineyard of Yavne. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya began</b> to speak <b>in honor of the hosts and taught: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And Saul said unto the Kenites: Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites lest I destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt”</b> (I Samuel 15:6)? <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as Jethro,</b> the forbearer of the Kenite tribe, who <b>only befriended Moses for his own honor,</b> is treated <b>in this way</b> and rewarded that his merit would protect his descendants; <b>all the more so</b> should <b>one who hosts a Torah scholar in his home, providing him with food and drink and availing him of his possessions,</b> be rewarded with that protection. |
| 1 Samuel 17:12 | “And the man in the days of Saul was old, and came among men” | Berakhot 58a:7 | On the topic of multitudes, the Gemara cites another verse: <b>“And the man in the days of Saul was old, and came among men”</b> (I Samuel 17:12). <b>Rava, and some say Rav Zevid, and some say Rav Oshaya, said: This</b> refers to <b>Yishai, father of David, who</b> always <b>went out with multitudes, and entered with multitudes, and taught Torah with multitudes. Ulla said: We hold there is no multitude in Babylonia.</b> The Sage <b>taught: A multitude is no fewer than six hundred thousand</b> people. |
| 1 Samuel 22:8 | as it is written: “And there is none of you that is ill over me or tells unto me” | Berakhot 12b:8 | The Gemara seeks to clarify the source of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need of mercy? <b>If you say</b> that it is <b>because</b> of what Saul said to his men, <b>as it is written: “And there is none of you that is ill over me or tells unto me”</b> (I Samuel 22:8), meaning that because Saul was a Torah scholar, it would have been appropriate for people to make themselves ill worrying about him; this is not an absolute proof. <b>Perhaps a king is different,</b> and excessive worry is appropriate in that case. Rather, proof that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need for mercy is <b>from here:</b> When David speaks of his enemies, Doeg and Ahitophel, who were Torah scholars, he says: <b>“But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth,</b> I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Psalms 35:13). One must be concerned to the extent that he dresses in sackcloth and fasts for the recovery of a Torah scholar. |
| 1 Samuel 24:3 | As it is written: “And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet, | Berakhot 62b:9 | <b>And what is this</b> modesty? <b>As it is written: “And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet,</b> to defecate. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave” (I Samuel 24:3). <b>It was taught</b> that the Sages said: <b>There was a fence within a fence, and a cave within a cave,</b> and Saul entered to defecate in the interest of modesty. With regard to the use of the term, <b>to cover</b> his feet, <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that,</b> even there, <b>he covered himself</b> with his garment <b>like a <i>sukka</i>.</b> |
| 1 Samuel 24:4 | “Then David arose, and cut off the corner of Saul’s robe privily” | Berakhot 62b:10 | The Gemara continues with a homiletic interpretation of the verse: <b>“Then David arose, and cut off the corner of Saul’s robe privily”</b> (I Samuel 24:4). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Anyone who treats clothing with contempt,</b> like David who tore Saul’s robe for no reason, will be punished in that <b>ultimately he will not benefit from</b> his garments, <b>as it is stated: “Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat”</b> (I Kings 1:1). |
| 1 Samuel 24:10 | and he said to kill you; and you spared you” | Berakhot 62b:7 | With regard to modesty in a bathroom, the Gemara cites an additional biblical allusion. When David found Saul in the cave and spared him, tearing the corner of his coat, he said to him: “Behold this day, your eyes have seen how the Lord has delivered you today into my hand in the cave, <b>and he said to kill you; and you spared you”</b> (I Samuel 24:10). |
| 1 Samuel 25:6 | and peace be to your house, | Berakhot 55b:10 | <b>And three</b> mentions of <b>peace, as it is written:</b><br><b>“Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the Lord that creates the expression of the lips; and I will heal him”</b> (Isaiah 57:19); <br><b>“Then the spirit clothed Amasai,</b> who was chief of the captains: Yours are we, David, and on your side, you son of Yishai;<br><b>peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers”</b> (I Chronicles 12:19);<br>and: <b>“Thus you shall say: All hail and peace be both unto you,</b><br><b>and peace be to your house,</b> and peace be unto all that you have” (I Samuel 25:6). |
| 1 Samuel 26:19 | “If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering” | Berakhot 62b:11 | As for David’s statement to Saul: <b>“If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering”</b> (I Samuel 26:19), <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: Do you call Me an inciter?</b> In retribution, <b>I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul</b> unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them” (Exodus 30:12). <b>Immediately</b> after God said this to David, <b>“Satan stood up against Israel</b> and incited David to number Israel” (I Chronicles 21:1). Moreover, <b>it is written:</b> “And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, <b>and He incited David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judea”</b> (II Samuel 24:1). The proportional response to David’s calling God an inciter was that He incited David. <b>And when he counted them, he did not take a ransom from them,</b> and he was punished, <b>as it is written: “So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the appointed time”</b> (II Samuel 24:15). |
| 1 Samuel 28:15 | “And Samuel said to Saul, why have you angered me to bring me up? And Saul said, I am very pained, and the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has removed Himself from me and answers me no more, neither by the hands of the prophets nor by dreams. And I call to you to tell me what to do” | Berakhot 12b:10 | However this proof is rejected: <b>Perhaps a community is different,</b> as a community is forgiven more easily than an individual. <b>Rather,</b> proof that an individual ashamed of his actions is forgiven for his transgressions is cited <b>from here,</b> when King Saul consulted Samuel by means of a necromancer before his final war with the Philistines: <b>“And Samuel said to Saul, why have you angered me to bring me up? And Saul said, I am very pained, and the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has removed Himself from me and answers me no more, neither by the hands of the prophets nor by dreams. And I call to you to tell me what to do”</b> (I Samuel 28:15). Saul says that he consulted prophets and dreams, but <b>he did not say</b> that he consulted <b>the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b> |
| 1 Samuel 28:19 | As it is stated: “And Samuel said to Saul: Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me” | Berakhot 12b:12 | The Gemara concludes: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that Saul was pardoned by</b> God in <b>the heavens</b> for his transgressions? <b>As it is stated: “And Samuel said to Saul: Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me”</b> (I Samuel 28:19). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With me</b> does not only mean that they will die, but also means, in a statement that contains an aspect of consolation, that they will be <b>in my company</b> among the righteous in heaven, as Saul was pardoned for his transgressions. |
| 1 Samuel 30:17 | mean evening? Doesn’t neshef mean morning? As it is written: “And David slew them from the neshef until the evening of the next day” | Berakhot 3b:23 | To this point, the discussion has been based on the assumption that <i>neshef</i> means evening. The Gemara asks: <b>Does <i>neshef</i></b> really <b>mean evening? Doesn’t <i>neshef</i> mean morning? As it is written: “And David slew them from the <i>neshef</i> until the evening of the next day”</b> (I Samuel 30:17). <b>Doesn’t</b> this verse mean <b>from the morning until the night,</b> in which case <i>neshef</i> must mean morning? |
| 2 Samuel 6:12 | “The Lord has blessed the house of Oved-edom…because of the ark of God” | Berakhot 63b:23 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, began</b> to speak <b>in honor of the hosts, and taught:</b> It is stated: <b>“The Lord has blessed the house of Oved-edom…because of the ark of God”</b> (II Samuel 6:12). <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as in reward for honoring the ark, which neither ate nor drank, but before which</b> Oved-edom simply <b>swept and sprinkled</b> water to settle the dust, he was treated <b>this way</b> and merited a blessing, <b>all the more so</b> should <b>one who hosts a Torah scholar in his home, providing him with food and drink and availing him of his possessions</b> without concern for his personal gain, be rewarded with such a blessing. |
| 2 Samuel 7:10 | “be disturbed no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore, as in the beginning” | Berakhot 7b:23 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> Setting a fixed place for prayer is so important that <b>one who sets a fixed place for his prayer, his enemies fall beneath him, as it is said: “And I will appoint a place for My nation, Israel, and I will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place.”</b> Through setting aside a place for prayer, they will merit to <b>“be disturbed no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore, as in the beginning”</b> (II Samuel 7:10). |
| 2 Samuel 7:29 | And from Your blessing may Your servant’s house be blessed forever” | Berakhot 50a:4 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Isn’t it written</b> that King David articulated his prayer in that manner: “Be pleased, therefore, to bless Your servant’s house, that it abide before You forever; for You, Lord God, have spoken. <b>And from Your blessing may Your servant’s house be blessed forever”</b> (II Samuel 7:29). David said: From Your blessing. The Gemara answers: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request it is different,</b> as it is inappropriate to demand the full bounty of God’s blessing. The Gemara questions this: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request, too, is it not written</b> that a request for the full bounty of God’s blessing is granted: <b>“Open your mouth wide, that I will fill it”</b> (Psalms 81:11)? What one receives corresponds to what he requests. The Gemara answered: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> where it is wholly appropriate to make excessive requests. |
| 2 Samuel 10:12 | As it is stated: “Be strong and we will be strong for the sake of our nation | Berakhot 32b:14 | <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>occupation</b> requires bolstering? <b>As it is stated: “Be strong and we will be strong for the sake of our nation</b> and for the cities of our God” (II Samuel 10:12). All of one’s labor requires bolstering. |
| 2 Samuel 12:11 | “Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your house” | Berakhot 7b:14 | <b>So too</b> was the case with <b>David. When the Holy One, Blessed be He, told him,</b> through Natan the prophet, after the incident with Bathsheba, <b>“Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your house”</b> (II Samuel 12:11), David <b>was despondent. He said: Perhaps</b> it will be <b>a slave or a <i>mamzer</i></b> who will rise up in my house, a person of such lowly status, who <b>will have no pity on me. But once</b> David <b>saw that Absalom was the one</b> through whom the prophecy was to be fulfilled, <b>he rejoiced,</b> as he was certain that Absalom would show him mercy. <b>That is why</b> David <b>said a psalm,</b> not a lament, thanking God for punishing him in the least severe manner possible. |
| 2 Samuel 12:13 | “The Lord also [ gam ] has put away your sin; you shall not die” | Berakhot 56b:19 | The Gemara says: <b>One who sees Ishmael in a dream,</b> it is an omen that <b>his prayer</b> will be <b>heard,</b> just as Ishmael’s prayer was heard. The Gemara notes: This refers <b>specifically</b> to where one saw <b>Ishmael, son of Abraham,</b> but <b>not</b> if one saw <b>a random Arab. One who sees a camel [<i>gamal</i>] in a dream,</b> it is an omen that <b>death was decreed upon him from heaven but he was spared. Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“I will go down with you into Egypt; and I will also surely bring you up again [<i>gam alo</i>]” (</b>Genesis 46:4<b>),</b> the acronym for which is <i>gamal</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The source for this is <b>from here,</b> another verse: <b>“The Lord also [<i>gam</i>] has put away your sin; you shall not die”</b> (II Samuel 12:13). |
| 2 Samuel 15:9 | Absalom: “Go in peace” | Berakhot 64a:9 | <b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who takes leave from another should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather,</b> he should say: <b>Go to peace. As we see</b> that, on the one hand, <b>Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace”</b> (Exodus 4:18), and <b>Moses ascended and was successful.</b> On the other hand, <b>David said to</b> his son, <b>Absalom: “Go in peace”</b> (II Samuel 15:9), and Absalom <b>went and was</b> ultimately <b>hanged.</b> |
| 2 Samuel 16:23 | and so it says: “Now the counsel of Ahitophel, which he counseled in those days, was as a man who inquires of the word of God; | Berakhot 3b:32 | The individuals named in this verse correspond with the roles in the <i>aggada</i> as follows: <b>Ahitophel is the adviser</b> whose advice they sought first with regard to going to war, <b>and so it says: “Now the counsel of Ahitophel, which he counseled in those days, was as a man who inquires of the word of God;</b> so was the counsel of Ahitophel both with David and with Absalom” (II Samuel 16:23). |
| 2 Samuel 20:23 | “And Benayahu ben Yehoyada was over the Kereti and over the Peleti ” | Berakhot 4a:2 | <b>And so it says</b> regarding Benayahu ben Yehoyada’s position as head of the Sanhedrin: <b>“And Benayahu ben Yehoyada was over the <i>Kereti</i> and over the <i>Peleti</i>”</b> (II Samuel 20:23). <b>And why was</b> the Sanhedrin <b>called <i>Kereti UPeleti</i>?</b> It was called <b><i>Kereti</i></b> because <b>they were decisive [<i>koretim</i>] in their pronouncements.</b> It was called <b><i>Peleti</i></b> because <b>their pronouncements</b> and wisdom <b>were wondrous [<i>mufla’im</i>]</b>. The head of the <i>Kereti UPeleti</i> was the head of the Sanhedrin. According to the order of the verse, upon being instructed by King David to go to war, the Sages first consulted with Ahitophel, then with the Sanhedrin, then they would ask the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> was <b>the general of the king’s army, Yoav,</b> given the command to ready the military for battle. |
| 2 Samuel 21:6 | and we will hang them up unto the Lord in the Giva of Saul, the chosen of the Lord” | Berakhot 12b:13 | <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that proof that Saul was pardoned is derived <b>from here,</b> from what the Gibeonites said to David: “Let seven men of his sons be given to us <b>and we will hang them up unto the Lord in the Giva of Saul, the chosen of the Lord”</b> (II Samuel 21:6). Certainly the Gibeonites, who were furious at Saul, would not refer to him as the chosen of the Lord. Therefore, this phrase must be understood as having been spoken by <b>a Divine Voice that emerged and said the chosen of the Lord,</b> because Saul had been pardoned for his transgressions and included among the completely righteous.<br>The Gemara returns to the primary focus of the chapter, the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. |
| 2 Samuel 23:20 | as it is stated: “And Benayahu, son of Yehoyada, son of a valiant man of Kabze’el, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow” | Berakhot 18a:14 | Rabbi Yonatan <b>said to him: Do</b> the dead <b>know so much? Isn’t it stated: “And the dead know nothing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:5)? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If you read</b> the verse, <b>you did not</b> read it <b>a second time, and if you</b> read it <b>a second time, you did not</b> read it <b>a third time, and if you</b> read it <b>a third time, they did not explain it to you</b> properly. The meaning of the verse: “For the living know that they will die, and the dead know nothing and have no more reward, for their memory has been forgotten” (Ecclesiastes 9:5): <b>For the living know that they will die, these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living.</b> An allusion to this is <b>as it is stated: “And Benayahu, son of Yehoyada, son of a valiant man of Kabze’el, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow”</b> (II Samuel 23:20). |
| 2 Samuel 24:1 | and He incited David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judea” | Berakhot 62b:11 | As for David’s statement to Saul: <b>“If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering”</b> (I Samuel 26:19), <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: Do you call Me an inciter?</b> In retribution, <b>I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul</b> unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them” (Exodus 30:12). <b>Immediately</b> after God said this to David, <b>“Satan stood up against Israel</b> and incited David to number Israel” (I Chronicles 21:1).

| 2 Samuel 24:16 | and said to the angel that destroyed the many [ rav ] people: | Berakhot 62b:13 | It is also stated there: “The Lord repented Him of the evil <b>and said to the angel that destroyed the many [<i>rav</i>] people:</b> It is enough; now stay your hand” (II Samuel 24:16). Explaining the meaning of the word <i>rav</i>, <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the angel: Take for me a great one [<i>rav</i>] from among them, who is worthy of defraying several</b> of Israel’s <b>debts.</b> As a result, <b>at that moment Avishai ben Tzeruya, who was equivalent to the majority of the Sanhedrin, died.</b> His death atoned for the entire nation. |
| 1 Kings 1:1 | as it is stated: “Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat” | Berakhot 62b:10 | The Gemara continues with a homiletic interpretation of the verse: <b>“Then David arose, and cut off the corner of Saul’s robe privily”</b> (I Samuel 24:4). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Anyone who treats clothing with contempt,</b> like David who tore Saul’s robe for no reason, will be punished in that <b>ultimately he will not benefit from</b> his garments, <b>as it is stated: “Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat”</b> (I Kings 1:1). |
| 1 Kings 1:31 | as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [ vatikod ] with her face to the ground” | Berakhot 34b:3 | Having mentioned Solomon bowing, the Gemara distinguishes between various types of bowing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> means bowing <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face,</b> with his face toward the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means bowing <b>upon one’s knees, as</b> regarding Solomon <b>it is stated:</b> He finished praying and <b>“he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling [<i>mikkeroa</i>] upon his knees.”</b> Finally, <b><i>hishtaḥava’a</i>, that is</b> bowing with <b>one’s hands and legs spread</b> in total submission, <b>as it is stated</b> in Jacob’s question to Joseph in response to his dream: <b>“Shall we, I and your mother and your brothers, come and bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground?”</b> (Genesis 37:10). |
| 1 Kings 8:28 | it is stated: “To hear the song and the prayer | Berakhot 31a:25 | <i>Halakhot</i> regarding the order of the prayers were also learned from the prayers of biblical characters. I <b>might have</b> thought <b>that one should request his own needs first, and afterwards recite prayers</b> of thanksgiving and praise; <b>it has already been articulated by Solomon</b> that this is not so, as in Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Holy Temple <b>it is stated: “To hear the song and the prayer</b> that Your servant prays before You today” (I Kings 8:28). In this verse, <b>song is prayer</b> in the sense of thanks and praise, and <b>prayer is</b> one’s <b>request</b> of his personal needs. Therefore, one who is praying <b>does not speak matters of request after</b> he began to recite <b><i>emet veyatziv</i></b> prior to the <i>Amida</i> prayer, which is the essence of prayer. Rather, he begins with praise in the first three blessings of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, and only thereafter does he include requests for his needs. <b>But after the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> there is no limit. If he desires to recite <b>even the equivalent of the order of the confession of Yom Kippur,</b> he may <b>recite</b> it. |
| 1 Kings 8:28 | to listen to the song and the prayer | Berakhot 6a:7 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Binyamin said: One’s prayer is only</b> fully <b>heard in a synagogue, as it is stated</b> with regard to King Solomon’s prayer in the Temple: “Yet have You turned toward the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, Lord my God, <b>to listen to the song and the prayer</b> which Your servant prays before You on this day” (I Kings 8:28). The following verse concludes: “To hear the prayer Your servant directs toward this place” (I Kings 8:29). We see that one’s prayer is heard specifically in the Temple, of which the synagogue is a microcosm (Rav Yoshiyahu Pinto). It may be inferred that <b>in a place of song,</b> a synagogue where God’s praises are sung, <b>there prayer should be.</b> |
| 1 Kings 8:35 | One who was standing in the Temple should focus his heart toward the Holy of Holies, as it is stated: “And they shall pray toward this place” | Berakhot 30a:9 | <b>One who was standing</b> in prayer <b>in the Diaspora should focus his heart toward Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “And they shall pray to You by way of their land</b> which You have given to their fathers” (I Kings 8:48). <br><b>One who was standing in Eretz Yisrael should focus his heart toward Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And they shall pray to the Lord by way of the city that You have chosen”</b> (I Kings 8:44). <br><b>One who was standing in Jerusalem should focus his heart toward the Temple, as it is stated: “And they shall pray toward this house”</b> (II Chronicles 6:32). <br><b>One who was standing in the Temple should focus his heart toward the Holy of Holies, as it is stated: “And they shall pray toward this place”</b> (I Kings 8:35). <br><b>One who was standing in the Holy of Holies should focus his heart toward the seat of the ark-cover [<i>kapporet</i>],</b> atop the ark, the dwelling place of God’s glory. <br><b>One who was standing behind the seat of the ark-cover should visualize himself as if standing before the ark-cover</b> and turn toward it.<br><b>Consequently,</b> one <b>standing</b> in prayer <b>in the East turns to face west,</b> and one standing <b>in the West turns to face east.</b> One standing <b>in the South turns to face north,</b> and one standing <b>in the North turns to face south; Consequently, all of</b> the people of <b>Israel focus</b> themselves <b>focusing their hearts toward one place,</b> the Holy of Holies in the Temple. |

| 1 Kings 18:2 | as it is stated: “And Elijah went to appear to Ahab” | Berakhot 10a:26 | With regard to redemption and prayer, the Gemara tells the story of Hezekiah’s illness, his prayer to God, and subsequent recuperation. <b>Rav Hamnuna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> praising the Holy One, Blessed be He: <b>“Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of the matter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1)? This verse means: <b>Who is like the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who knows how to effect compromise [<i>peshara</i>] between two righteous individuals, between Hezekiah,</b> the king of Judea, <b>and Isaiah</b> the prophet. They disagreed over which of them should visit the other. <b>Hezekiah said: Let Isaiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Elijah</b> the prophet, <b>who went to Ahab,</b> the king of Israel, <b>as it is stated: “And Elijah went to appear to Ahab”</b> (I Kings 18:2). This proves that it is the prophet who must seek out the king. <b>And Isaiah said: Let Hezekiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Yehoram ben Ahab,</b> king of Israel, <b>who went to Elisha</b> the prophet, as it is stated: “So the king of Israel, Jehosaphat and the king of Edom went down to him” (II Kings 3:12). |
| 1 Kings 18:37 | and You have turned their hearts backward” | Berakhot 31b:27 | <b>And</b> on a similar note, <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Elijah spoke impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High</b> as well in his prayer at Mount Carmel, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Answer me, Lord, answer me, that this people will know that You are the Lord, God, <b>and You have turned their hearts backward”</b> (I Kings 18:37), claiming that God caused Israel to sin. On this topic, <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, ultimately conceded to Elijah</b> that he was correct? |
| 1 Kings 18:37 | “Answer me, Lord, answer me, | Berakhot 9b:8 | Having explained the use of the double language of “I will be that I will be,” the Gemara proceeds to explain the double language employed by Elijah on Mount Carmel: <b>“Answer me, Lord, answer me,</b> that this people will know that You are the Lord, God, and You have turned their hearts backward” (I Kings 18:37). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Why did Elijah say answer me twice?</b> This repetition <b>teaches that Elijah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, answer me that fire will descend from heaven and consume everything that is on the altar, and answer me that You will divert their mind</b> from devising alternative explanations for what they witnessed so <b>that they will not say that they were acts of sorcery. As it is stated</b> that Elijah said: <b>“And You have turned their hearts backward,”</b> God can restore them to the proper path as well. |
| 2 Kings 3:11 | as it is stated: “Here is Elisha son of Shafat, who poured water over Elijah’s hands” | Berakhot 7b:26 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Service of Torah is greater than its study,</b> i.e., serving a Torah scholar and spending time in his company is greater than learning Torah from him. Torah study is one component of a Torah life, but one who serves a Torah scholar learns about every aspect of life from his actions. This is derived from the verse that speaks in praise of Elisha, <b>as it is stated: “Here is Elisha son of Shafat, who poured water over Elijah’s hands”</b> (II Kings 3:11). The verse <b>does not say</b> that <b>he learned</b> from Elijah, <b>rather</b> that <b>he poured</b> water, which <b>teaches</b> that <b>the service of Torah</b> represented by Elisha pouring water over Elijah’s hands <b>is greater than its study.</b> |
| 2 Kings 3:12 | who went to Elisha | Berakhot 10a:26 | With regard to redemption and prayer, the Gemara tells the story of Hezekiah’s illness, his prayer to God, and subsequent recuperation. <b>Rav Hamnuna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> praising the Holy One, Blessed be He: <b>“Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of the matter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1)? This verse means: <b>Who is like the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who knows how to effect compromise [<i>peshara</i>] between two righteous individuals, between Hezekiah,</b> the king of Judea, <b>and Isaiah</b> the prophet. They disagreed over which of them should visit the other. <b>Hezekiah said: Let Isaiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Elijah</b> the prophet, <b>who went to Ahab,</b> the king of Israel, <b>as it is stated: “And Elijah went to appear to Ahab”</b> (I Kings 18:2). This proves that it is the prophet who must seek out the king. <b>And Isaiah said: Let Hezekiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Yehoram ben Ahab,</b> king of Israel, <b>who went to Elisha</b> the prophet, as it is stated: “So the king of Israel, Jehosaphat and the king of Edom went down to him” (II Kings 3:12). |
| 2 Kings 4:9 | “And she said to her husband: Behold now, I perceive that he is a holy man of God | Berakhot 10b:22 | Regarding the woman from Shunem: <b>“And she said to her husband: Behold now, I perceive that he is a holy man of God</b> who passes by us continually” (II Kings 4:9). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: From here,</b> where the woman from Shunem perceived the prophet’s greatness before her husband did, derive <b>that a woman recognizes</b> the character of her <b>guests more than a man</b> does. |
| 2 Kings 4:10 | “Let us make, I pray thee, a small chamber on the roof, | Berakhot 10b:14 | Having mentioned the chamber on the roof built for Elisha by the woman from Shunem, the Gemara now describes the entire event. The woman from Shunem suggested to her husband: <b>“Let us make, I pray thee, a small chamber on the roof,</b> and let us place a bed, table, stool and candlestick for him there, and it will be, when he comes to us, that he will turn in there” (II Kings 4:10). |
| 2 Kings 4:27 | stated: “And Geihazi approached her to push her away [ lehodfa ]” | Berakhot 10b:24 | With regard to the verse: <b>“He is holy,” Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> The woman from Shunem intimated that: <b>He is holy,</b> but <b>his attendant,</b> Geihazi, <b>is not holy,</b> as she saw no indication of holiness in him (<i>Iyyun Ya’akov</i>). Here too, she correctly perceived the character of her guest, <b>as it is</b> later <b>stated: “And Geihazi approached her to push her away [<i>lehodfa</i>]”</b> (II Kings 4:27). And <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: He grabbed her by the majesty of her beauty [<i>hod yofya</i>],</b> meaning that when he pushed her he grabbed her breasts in a licentious manner. |
| 2 Kings 4:30 | Elisha, as it is written: “And he arose and followed her” | Berakhot 61a:23 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects to this: If that is so</b> that you understand the verse literally, what do you say about the verse <b>with regard to Elkana,</b> the father of the prophet Samuel, <b>as it is written: “And Elkana walked after his wife,”</b> and what of the verse <b>with regard to</b> the prophet <b>Elisha, as it is written: “And he arose and followed her”</b> (II Kings 4:30)? <b>Does</b> this verse <b>mean</b> that he <b>literally walked after her? Rather,</b> certainly this verse means that <b>he followed her words and advice.</b> <b>Here, too,</b> then the verse concerning Manoah may be similarly interpreted; he <b>followed</b> his wife’s <b>words</b> <b>and followed her advice,</b> and did not literally walk behind her.  |
| 2 Kings 8:1 | Famine, as it is written: “For the Lord has called for a famine; | Berakhot 55a:10 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three matters are proclaimed by the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself: Famine, plenty, and a good leader.</b> The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>Famine, as it is written: “For the Lord has called for a famine;</b> and it shall also come upon the land seven years” (II Kings 8:1). <b>Plenty, as it is written: “And I will call for the grain, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you”</b> (Ezekiel 36:29). And <b>a good leader, as it is written: “And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: See, I have called by name Bezalel,</b> son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah” (Exodus 31:1–2). |
| 2 Kings 18:16 | He cut off the doors of the Sanctuary and sent them to the king of Assyria | Berakhot 10b:8 | Yet, <b>with regard to three</b> other innovations, the Sages of his generation <b>did not agree with him:</b> <br><b>He stopped up the waters of the Gihon,</b> the Pool of Siloam, diverting its water into the city by means of a tunnel (II Chronicles 32:30), <b>and they did not agree with him.</b> <br><b>He cut off the doors of the Sanctuary and sent them to the king of Assyria</b> (II Kings 18:16), <b>and they did not agree with him.</b> <br><b>He intercalated Nisan in Nisan,</b> creating a leap year by adding an extra month during the month of Nisan. That intercalation must be performed before the end of Adar (II Chronicles 30:2). |
| 2 Kings 18:21 | “Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed” | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| 2 Kings 19:34 | as it is stated: “And I will protect this city to save it, for My sake and for the sake of David, My servant” | Berakhot 10b:13 | <b>Hezekiah,</b> however, <b>based</b> his request <b>upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You”</b> (Isaiah 38:3). When God answered his prayers, <b>it was based upon the merit of others</b> with no mention made of Hezekiah’s own merit, <b>as it is stated: “And I will protect this city to save it, for My sake and for the sake of David, My servant”</b> (II Kings 19:34). <b>And that is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness;</b> but You have, in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back” (Isaiah 38:17)? This verse teaches that <b>even when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent him peace</b> and told him that he would recover from his illness, <b>it was bitter for him,</b> because God did not take his merit into consideration. |
| 1 Chronicles 1:27 | “Abram is Abraham” | Berakhot 13a:4 | Having mentioned the changing of Jacob’s name, the Gemara addresses the changing of the names of Abraham and Sarah. What is the meaning of changing Abram’s name to Abraham? As it is stated: <b>“Abram is Abraham”</b> (I Chronicles 1:27). |
| 1 Chronicles 5:1 | but, since he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, | Berakhot 7b:8 | <b>While my son,</b> Reuben, <b>even though Joseph took his birthright from him by force, as it is written:</b> “And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; <b>but, since he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph,</b> son of Israel” (I Chronicles 5:1). <b>Nevertheless, he was not jealous of him, as it is written</b> when Joseph’s brothers sought to kill him: <b>“And Reuben heard and he saved him from their hands,</b> saying ‘Let us not take his life’” (Genesis 37:21). |
| 1 Chronicles 12:19 | peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers” | Berakhot 55b:10 | <b>And three</b> mentions of <b>peace, as it is written:</b><br><b>“Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the Lord that creates the expression of the lips; and I will heal him”</b> (Isaiah 57:19); <br><b>“Then the spirit clothed Amasai,</b> who was chief of the captains: Yours are we, David, and on your side, you son of Yishai;<br><b>peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers”</b> (I Chronicles 12:19);<br>and: <b>“Thus you shall say: All hail and peace be both unto you,</b><br><b>and peace be to your house,</b> and peace be unto all that you have” (I Samuel 25:6). |
| 1 Chronicles 17:21 | “Who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land?” | Berakhot 6a:20 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin: What is written in the phylacteries of the Master of the world? Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin replied:</b> It is written: <b>“Who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land?”</b> (I Chronicles 17:21). God’s phylacteries serve to connect Him, in a sense, to the world, the essence of which is Israel. |
| 1 Chronicles 21:1 | “Satan stood up against Israel | Berakhot 62b:11 | As for David’s statement to Saul: <b>“If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering”</b> (I Samuel 26:19), <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: Do you call Me an inciter?</b> In retribution, <b>I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul</b> unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them” (Exodus 30:12). <b>Immediately</b> after God said this to David, <b>“Satan stood up against Israel</b> and incited David to number Israel” (I Chronicles 21:1). Moreover, <b>it is written:</b> “And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, <b>and He incited David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judea”</b> (II Samuel 24:1). The proportional response to David’s calling God an inciter was that He incited David. <b>And when he counted them, he did not take a ransom from them,</b> and he was punished, <b>as it is written: “So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the appointed time”</b> (II Samuel 24:15). |
| 1 Chronicles 21:15 | “The Lord beheld, and He repented him | Berakhot 62b:14 | On a parallel note, it is said: <b>“The Lord beheld, and He repented him</b> of the evil” (I Chronicles 21:15). The Gemara asks: <b>What did the Lord behold?</b> |
| 1 Chronicles 26:8 | “All these were of the sons of Oved-edom; they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service; sixty-two of Oved-edom” | Berakhot 64a:1 | <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Oved-edom had <b>sons…Peulletai the eighth,” and</b> in the continuation of the same verse <b>it is written: “For God blessed him”</b> (I Chronicles 26:4–5); apparently, these eight children were the blessing, as it is stated: <b>“All these were of the sons of Oved-edom; they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service; sixty-two of Oved-edom”</b> (I Chronicles 26:8). Each of the nine women gave birth to six sons, for a total of fifty-four. If one adds the original eight, there were sixty-two altogether. |
| 1 Chronicles 27:34 | As it is written: “And after Ahitophel was Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Evyatar, and the general of the king’s army, Yoav” | Berakhot 3b:31 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this <i>aggada</i> based? <b>As it is written: “And after Ahitophel was Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Evyatar, and the general of the king’s army, Yoav”</b> (I Chronicles 27:34). |

| 2 Chronicles 6:32 | One who was standing in Jerusalem should focus his heart toward the Temple, as it is stated: “And they shall pray toward this house” | Berakhot 30a:9 | <b>One who was standing</b> in prayer <b>in the Diaspora should focus his heart toward Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “And they shall pray to You by way of their land</b> which You have given to their fathers” (I Kings 8:48). <br><b>One who was standing in Eretz Yisrael should focus his heart toward Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And they shall pray to the Lord by way of the city that You have chosen”</b> (I Kings 8:44). <br><b>One who was standing in Jerusalem should focus his heart toward the Temple, as it is stated: “And they shall pray toward this house”</b> (II Chronicles 6:32). <br><b>One who was standing in the Temple should focus his heart toward the Holy of Holies, as it is stated: “And they shall pray toward this place”</b> (I Kings 8:35). <br><b>One who was standing in the Holy of Holies should focus his heart toward the seat of the ark-cover [<i>kapporet</i>],</b> atop the ark, the dwelling place of God’s glory. <br><b>One who was standing behind the seat of the ark-cover should visualize himself as if standing before the ark-cover</b> and turn toward it.<br><b>Consequently,</b> one <b>standing</b> in prayer <b>in the East turns to face west,</b> and one standing <b>in the West turns to face east.</b> One standing <b>in the South turns to face north,</b> and one standing <b>in the North turns to face south; Consequently, all of</b> the people of <b>Israel focus</b> themselves <b>focusing their hearts toward one place,</b> the Holy of Holies in the Temple. |

| Nehemiah 4:15 | “And we perform the work, and half of them grasp their spears from dawn until the emergence of the stars” | Berakhot 2b:8 | The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From when does one begin to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in the evening? From the time when people enter to eat their bread on Shabbat eve.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> As they do in our mishna, <b>the Rabbis say: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, a sign for which is the emergence of the stars.

As <b>it is stated</b> with regard to the building of the walls of Jerusalem: <b>“And we perform the work, and half of them grasp their spears from dawn until the emergence of the stars”</b> (Nehemiah 4:15). <b>And it says: “That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day”</b> (Nehemiah 4:16).

| Nehemiah 4:16 | And it says: “That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day” | Berakhot 2b:8 | The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From when does one begin to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in the evening?

| Nehemiah 9:5 | are included | Berakhot 53b:29 | The Gemara responds: This is subject to <b>a tannaitic dispute, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both the one who recites a blessing and the one who answers</b> amen <b>are included</b> among those who “stand up and bless” (Nehemiah 9:5), but <b>they hurry to</b> reward, i.e., <b>the one who recites the blessing, more than</b> they hurry to reward, i.e., <b>the one who answers amen.</b> |
| Nehemiah 9:5 | that one does not answer amen in the Temple? As it is stated: “Stand up and bless the Lord, your God, from everlasting to everlasting” | Berakhot 63a:4 | The Gemara explains: <b>Why</b> were they insistent upon this formula <b>to that extent? Because one does not answer amen in the Temple.</b> Because there is a unique response to the blessings in the Temple, a unique formula for their conclusion was instituted. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not answer amen in the Temple? As it is stated: “Stand up and bless the Lord, your God, from everlasting to everlasting”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5), which refers to the conclusion. <b>The verse</b> in Nehemiah <b>continues: “And let them say: Blessed be Your glorious name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). The response is exalted above other blessings. |
| Nehemiah 9:7 | “You are the Lord, God, Who chose Abram | Berakhot 13a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, and some say Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida, raised an objection</b> to the statements of bar Kappara and Rabbi Eliezer based on what is said in the recounting of the history of the Jewish people: <b>“You are the Lord, God, Who chose Abram</b> and took him out of Ur Kasdim and made his name Abraham” (Nehemiah 9:7). Here the Bible refers to him as Abram. |
| Esther 4:2 | It says: “For none may enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth” | Berakhot 62b:24 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda, says: This</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>is unnecessary.</b> It could be otherwise derived. <b>It says: “For none may enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth”</b> (Esther 4:2). <b>This matter</b> can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: Just as sackcloth, which is</b> generally <b>not</b> considered <b>repulsive before</b> one who is <b>flesh and blood, is</b> forbidden within the king’s gate, <b>all the more so spitting, which is repulsive,</b> should be forbidden <b>before the King of Kings.</b> |
| Job 1:21 | “The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” | Berakhot 60b:11 | <b>And the Rabbis said:</b> The proof is <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord”</b> (Job 1:21). |
| Job 3:13 | Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Job 3:22 | “Who rejoice in exultation and are glad when they can find a grave” | Berakhot 8a:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The time of finding</b> refers to a respectful <b>burial,</b> for which one should pray. Supporting Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: What</b> is the <b>verse</b> that teaches that the time of finding refers to burial? <b>“Who rejoice in exultation and are glad when they can find a grave”</b> (Job 3:22), as there are situations in which one is relieved when his body finds a grave in which to rest. <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said, that is the</b> meaning of the <b>folk saying: A person should even pray for mercy until the final shovelful</b> of dirt <b>is thrown</b> upon his grave. |
| Job 3:25 | said to him: Do you wish to bring suffering upon yourself; as it is stated: “For that which I did fear is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has overtaken me” | Berakhot 60a:18 | In a similar vein, the Gemara relates: <b>Yehuda bar Natan was coming and going after Rav Hamnuna.</b> Yehuda bar Natan <b>sighed;</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him: Do you wish to bring suffering upon yourself; as it is stated: “For that which I did fear is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has overtaken me”</b> (Job 3:25)? He responded: <b>Is it not said: “Happy is the man who fears always”?</b> Rav Hamnuna answered: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah.</b> |
| Job 5:7 | and the sparks [ reshef ] fly [ uf ] upward” | Berakhot 5a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> upon his bed, demons stay away from him.</b> This is alluded to, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But man is born into trouble, <b>and the sparks [<i>reshef</i> ] fly [<i>uf</i> ] upward”</b> (Job 5:7). The verse is explained: The word <b>fly [<i>uf</i> ]</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah,</b> as Torah is difficult to grasp and easy to lose, like something that floats away, <b>as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone;</b> for riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies into the heavens” (Proverbs 23:5). The word <b>“sparks”</b> means <b>nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [<i>reshef</i>] and bitter destruction [<i>ketev meriri</i>],</b> and the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of the dust” (Deuteronomy 32:24). Here we see <i>reshef</i> listed along with <i>ketev meriri</i>, both of which are understood by the Sages to be names of demons. |
| Job 9:9 | it is written: “Who makes Ursa Major, Orion, and Pleiades, | Berakhot 58b:12 | On the subject of stars, the Gemara notes that <b>Shmuel raised a contradiction</b> between the implications of two verses with regard to constellations. On the one hand <b>it is written: “Who makes Ursa Major, Orion, and Pleiades,</b> and the chambers of the south” (Job 9:9); Orion precedes Pleiades. <b>And</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “He Who makes Pleiades and Orion”</b> (Amos 5:8); Pleiades precedes Orion. <b>So how</b> is this reconciled? The Gemara replies: <b>Were it not for Orion’s heat, the universe could not exist because of the cold of Pleiades;</b> and conversely, <b>were it not for the cold of Pleiades, the universe could not exist because of the heat of Orion.</b> |
| Job 9:10 | I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out” | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Job 13:15 | “Though He slay me, I will trust in Him” | Berakhot 10a:32 | With regard to the fact that one should not despair of God’s mercy, the Gemara cites that <b>it was also said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Eliezer both said: Even if a sharp sword is resting upon a person’s neck, he should not prevent himself from</b> praying for <b>mercy, as it is stated</b> in the words of Job: <b>“Though He slay me, I will trust in Him”</b> (Job 13:15). Even though God is about to take his life, he still prays for God’s mercy. |
| Job 14:21 | anguish? The other said to him: From where would he know? Isn’t it written: “His sons are honored yet he shall not know it, | Berakhot 18b:4 | The Gemara relates a story on this topic: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya went out to the villages</b> to oversee the laborers. <b>They forgot what they had learned and were struggling to recall it. One</b> of them <b>said to the other:</b> Does <b>our</b> deceased <b>father know of</b> our <b>anguish? The other said to him: From where would he know? Isn’t it written: “His sons are honored yet he shall not know it,</b> they come to sorrow and he shall not understand them” (Job 14:21)? The dead do not know. |
| Job 14:22 | not know? Isn’t it written: “Only in his flesh does he feel pain, in his soul does he mourn” | Berakhot 18b:5 | <b>The other said</b> back <b>to him: And</b> do the dead truly <b>not know? Isn’t it written: “Only in his flesh does he feel pain, in his soul does he mourn”</b> (Job 14:22)? Based on this verse <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> Gnawing <b>maggots are as excruciating to the dead as</b> the stab of <b>a needle to the flesh of the living.</b> The dead must have the capacity to feel and know. |
| Job 18:4 | as it is stated: “You who throw your soul in your face, for your sake will the earth be forsaken? | Berakhot 5b:25 | Another of Abba Binyamin’s statements with regard to the laws of prayer <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Binyamin says: If two</b> people <b>enter</b> a synagogue outside of the city <b>in order to pray, and one began praying before</b> the other <b>and did not wait for the other</b> person to complete his prayer, <b>and left</b> him alone in the synagogue, <b>his prayer is thrown back in his face.</b> Because he left the other person alone and caused him to be distracted during his prayer, his own prayer is thrown back in his face, <b>as it is stated: “You who throw your soul in your face, for your sake will the earth be forsaken?</b> The Rock will be moved from its place” (Job 18:4). This verse indicates that one who left the other person alone effectively causes his soul, as prayer is the outpouring of the soul before God, to be thrown in his face. God says to that person: For your sake, do you think because you left, the earth will be forsaken, that God will leave the world and the prayer of the other person will go unheard? |
| Job 22:25 | be doubled, as it is stated: “And the Almighty be your treasure, and precious [ toafot ] silver unto you” | Berakhot 63a:20 | <b>Rav Huna bar Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar: Anyone who includes the name of heaven in his distress,</b> i.e., who turns and prays to God in his time of trouble, <b>his livelihood will</b> ultimately <b>be doubled, as it is stated: “And the Almighty be your treasure, and precious [<i>toafot</i>] silver unto you”</b> (Job 22:25). If you include God in your trouble, your silver will be doubled. <i>Eif</i>, which in Aramaic means double, is etymologically similar to <i>toafot</i>. |
| Job 36:5 | from here: “Behold, God is mighty, He despises no one” | Berakhot 8a:3 | <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here: “Behold, God is mighty, He despises no one”</b> (Job 36:5). He adopts an alternative reading of the verse: “Behold, God will not despise” the prayer of “the mighty,” i.e., the community. <b>And it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me; for there were many with me.</b> God shall hear and answer them…” (Psalms 55:19–20). This verse teaches that the prayer was answered because there were many with me when it was offered. |
| Job 36:24 | With regard to a good guest, what does he say? “Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung” | Berakhot 58a:6 | <b>With regard to a good guest, what does he say? “Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung”</b> (Job 36:24); he praises and acknowledges those who helped him. <b>With regard to a bad guest it is written: “Men do therefore fear him;</b> he regards not any who are wise of heart” (Job 37:24). |
| Job 37:24 | With regard to a bad guest it is written: “Men do therefore fear him; | Berakhot 58a:6 | <b>With regard to a good guest, what does he say? “Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung”</b> (Job 36:24); he praises and acknowledges those who helped him. <b>With regard to a bad guest it is written: “Men do therefore fear him;</b> he regards not any who are wise of heart” (Job 37:24). |
| Job 38:31 | “Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the bands of Orion?” | Berakhot 58b:13 | <b>And we learned</b> a tradition that <b>if the tail of</b> the constellation <b>Scorpio</b> did <b>not</b> rest <b>in the River of Fire, anyone stung by a scorpion would not survive. And that is what the All-Merciful said to Job</b> of the relationship between heat and cold among the stars: <b>“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the bands of Orion?”</b> (Job 38:31); God alternates intensifying the power of different constellations in order to raise or lower the temperature. |
| Job 38:32 | with her sons?” | Berakhot 58b:15 | With regard to the verse: “Who makes Ursa Major, Orion, and Pleiades” (Job 9:9), the Gemara asks: <b>What is Ursa Major [<i>Ash</i>]? Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is the star called <b><i>Yota</i>.</b> This name was unfamiliar as well, so the Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>Yota</i>?</b> There is disagreement; <b>some say</b> that <i>Yota</i> is the group of stars comprising the <b>tail of Aries, while others say</b> that <i>Yota</i> belongs to <b>the head of Taurus.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that <i>Yota</i> is the group of stars comprising the <b>tail of Aries, as it is written: “Or can you guide Ursa</b> Major <b>with her sons?”</b> (Job 38:32); <b>apparently it was incomplete and</b> the tail <b>appears</b> |
| Job 38:32 | with her sons?” | Berakhot 59a:3 | The Gemara argues: <b>Then</b> God should have <b>created two other</b> new <b>stars</b> for Pleiades. The Gemara responds: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore</b> those same stars <b>to</b> Ursa Major, <b>as it is stated: “Or can you guide [<i>tanḥem</i>] Ursa</b> Major <b>with her sons?”</b> (Job 38:32), which is interpreted homiletically in the sense of consolation [<i>tanḥumim</i>] apparently due to the restoration of those stars. |
| Job 41:10 | Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Psalms 1:1 | Every chapter that was dear to David, he began with “happy is” and concluded with “happy is.” He opened with “happy is,” as it is written: “Happy is the man | Berakhot 10a:1 | <b>Every chapter that was dear to David, he began with “happy is” and concluded with “happy is.” He opened with “happy is,” as it is written: “Happy is the man</b> who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked or stood in the way of sinners or sat in the dwelling place of the scornful” (Psalms 1:1). <b>And he concluded with “happy,” as it is written</b> at the end of the chapter: “Pay homage in purity, lest He be angry, and you perish on the way when His anger is kindled suddenly. <b>Happy are those who take refuge in Him”</b> (Psalms 2:12). We see that these two chapters actually constitute a single chapter. |
| Psalms 2:11 | “Serve the Lord in fear and rejoice with trembling” | Berakhot 30b:19 | The Gemara rejects this too: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps, actually I would say to you</b> that it should be read as it is written: <b>Specifically, “in the beauty,”</b> and it means that one should pray in beautiful clothing, <b>as</b> in the case <b>of Rav Yehuda who would adorn himself and then pray.</b> Rav Yehuda believed that one who comes before the King must wear his most beautiful clothing. The Gemara has yet to find a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one must approach prayer from an atmosphere of gravity. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> it can be derived <b>from here,</b> from this verse: <b>“Serve the Lord in fear and rejoice with trembling”</b> (Psalms 2:11). |
| Psalms 2:12 | Happy are those who take refuge in Him” | Berakhot 10a:1 | <b>Every chapter that was dear to David, he began with “happy is” and concluded with “happy is.” He opened with “happy is,” as it is written: “Happy is the man</b> who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked or stood in the way of sinners or sat in the dwelling place of the scornful” (Psalms 1:1). <b>And he concluded with “happy,” as it is written</b> at the end of the chapter: “Pay homage in purity, lest He be angry, and you perish on the way when His anger is kindled suddenly. <b>Happy are those who take refuge in Him”</b> (Psalms 2:12). We see that these two chapters actually constitute a single chapter. |
| Psalms 3:1 | A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom” | Berakhot 10a:8 | In explaining passages from Psalms, the Gemara relates another instance of a response to the question of a heretic: <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1), <b>and</b> similarly <b>it is said:</b> “To the chief musician, <i>al tashḥet</i>, <b>a <i>mikhtam</i> of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave”</b> (Psalms 57:1). <b>Which event was first? Since the event with Saul was first,</b> it would have been appropriate <b>to write it first.</b> |
| Psalms 3:1 | As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom” | Berakhot 7b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> other aggadic statements <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> The existence of <b>wayward</b> children <b>in a person’s home is more troublesome than the war of Gog and Magog,</b> the ultimate war, the climax of the travails of Messianic times. <b>As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1). <b>And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me”</b> (Psalms 3:2). <b>While concerning the war of Gog and Magog,</b> which is alluded to in the second chapter of Psalms, <b>it is written: “Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples speak for naught?</b> The kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed…He that sits in heaven laughs, the Lord mocks them” (Psalms 2:1–4). <b>Yet</b> in this chapter describing the war of Gog and Magog <b>“how numerous are my enemies” is not written,</b> as it is not as difficult as raising a wayward son like Absalom. |
| Psalms 3:2 | And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me” | Berakhot 7b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> other aggadic statements <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> The existence of <b>wayward</b> children <b>in a person’s home is more troublesome than the war of Gog and Magog,</b> the ultimate war, the climax of the travails of Messianic times. <b>As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1). <b>And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me”</b> (Psalms 3:2). <b>While concerning the war of Gog and Magog,</b> which is alluded to in the second chapter of Psalms, <b>it is written: “Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples speak for naught?</b> The kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed…He that sits in heaven laughs, the Lord mocks them” (Psalms 2:1–4). <b>Yet</b> in this chapter describing the war of Gog and Magog <b>“how numerous are my enemies” is not written,</b> as it is not as difficult as raising a wayward son like Absalom. |
| Psalms 3:8 | And that is what is written: “You break the teeth of the wicked” | Berakhot 54b:5 | Og <b>wanted to remove it</b> from his head; <b>his teeth were extended to one side</b> of his head <b>and to the other and he was unable to</b> remove it. <b>And that is what is written: “You break the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8). <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the homiletic interpretation of <b>Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakish, as Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “You break the teeth of the wicked”? Do not read</b> it as: <b>You break [<i>shibarta</i>], but rather</b> as: <b>You lengthened [<i>shirbavta</i>].</b> |
| Psalms 4:5 | “Tremble, and do not sin; say to your heart upon your bed and be still, Selah” | Berakhot 4b:27 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Even though one recited <i>Shema</i> in the synagogue, it is a mitzva to recite it upon his bed</b> in fulfillment of the verse: “When you lie down.” <b>Rabbi Yosei said: What verse</b> alludes to the fact that one must recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening, upon his bed, as well? <b>“Tremble, and do not sin; say to your heart upon your bed and be still, Selah”</b> (Psalms 4:5). This is understood to mean: Recite <i>Shema</i>, about which it is written, “on your hearts,” upon your bed, and afterward be still and sleep. |
| Psalms 5:4 | with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward” | Berakhot 6b:28 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering”</b> (Psalms 141:2). <br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward”</b> (Psalms 5:4). |
| Psalms 5:8 | “But as for me, by Your abundant loving-kindness I will enter Your house, at Your Holy Temple I will bow in reverence for You” | Berakhot 30b:17 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said,</b> it can be proved <b>from here,</b> as David said: <b>“But as for me, by Your abundant loving-kindness I will enter Your house, at Your Holy Temple I will bow in reverence for You”</b> (Psalms 5:8). Entering into prayer like entering the Holy Temple must be performed reverentially. |
| Psalms 7:12 | God is furious every day” | Berakhot 7a:7 | The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, God becomes angry, as it is stated: “God vindicates the righteous, <b>God is furious every day”</b> (Psalms 7:12). |
| Psalms 10:5 | As it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times; | Berakhot 7b:18 | From these verses in Psalms and Proverbs, it would seem that one is encouraged to provoke the wicked. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak say: If you see a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling, do not provoke him.</b> As long as he is enjoying good fortune, there is no point in confronting him. <b>As it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times;</b> Your judgments are far beyond him; as for his adversaries, he snorts at them” (Psalms 10:5). The verse teaches us that the ways of the wicked will always succeed. <b>And not only that, but he emerges victorious in judgment, as it is stated: “Your judgments are far beyond him,”</b> meaning that even when he is brought to justice, it does not affect him. <b>And not only that, but he witnesses his enemies’</b> downfall, <b>as it is stated: “As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.”</b> |
| Psalms 10:17 | direct their hearts, Your ear will listen” | Berakhot 31a:17 | Returning to the topic of preparation for prayer, <b>the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who prays must focus his heart toward Heaven. Abba Shaul says: An indication of</b> the importance of this <b>matter</b> is stated in the verse: “The desire of the humble You have heard, Lord; <b>direct their hearts, Your ear will listen”</b> (Psalms 10:17). In other words, if one focuses his heart in prayer as a result of God directing his heart, his prayer will be accepted as God’s ear will listen. |
| Psalms 12:9 | As it is stated: “The wicked walk round about, | Berakhot 6b:18 | Back to the topic of deference for a synagogue, the Gemara records that <b>Rav Huna said: One who prays behind the synagogue is called wicked,</b> as while the entire congregation is facing one direction to pray, he faces the opposite direction creating the impression that he is treating the synagogue and its congregation with contempt. <b>As it is stated: “The wicked walk round about,</b> when vileness is exalted among the sons of men” (Psalms 12:9). In other words, only the wicked walk round about the synagogue in order to pray. |
| Psalms 14:1 | as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’; | Berakhot 12b:22 | In response, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> where these elements were derived from allusions in the verse, “You shall stray neither after your hearts nor after your eyes, after which you would lust” (Numbers 15:39). <b>As it was taught: “After your hearts” refers to</b> following opinions <b>of heresy</b> that may arise in one’s heart. The Gemara offers a proof, <b>as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’;</b> they have been corrupt, they have acted abominably; there is none who does good” (Psalms 14:1). The phrase: <b>“After your eyes,”</b> in <b>this</b> verse refers to following <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, that a person might see and desire, <b>as it is stated: “And Samson said to his father, ‘That one take for me, for she is upright in my eyes’”</b> (Judges 14:3). The passage: <b>“You shall stray after”</b> refers to promiscuity, which in the parlance of the prophets is a metaphor for <b>idol worship, as it is stated:</b> “The children of Israel again <b>went astray after the Be’alim”</b> (Judges 8:33). |
| Psalms 17:14 | male children, as it is stated: “And whose belly You fill with Your treasure [ utzfunekha ], who have sons in plenty | Berakhot 5b:23 | In praise of that stringency, the Sages added that <b>Rabbi Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who places his bed facing north to south will</b> be rewarded with <b>male children, as it is stated: “And whose belly You fill with Your treasure [<i>utzfunekha</i>], who have sons in plenty</b> and leave their abundance to their babies” (Psalms 17:14). This verse indicates that one who sets his bed facing north will be rewarded with sons in plenty, as north [<i>tzafon</i>] is etymologically similar to Your treasure [<i>tzfunekha</i>]. |
| Psalms 17:14 | “From death, by Your hand, O Lord, from death | Berakhot 61b:10 | <b>The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: This is Torah and this its reward?</b> As it is stated: <b>“From death, by Your hand, O Lord, from death</b> of the world” (Psalms 17:14); Your hand, God, kills and does not save. God <b>said</b> the end of the verse <b>to</b> the ministering angels: <b>“Whose portion is in this life.”</b> And then <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: Happy are you, Rabbi Akiva, as you are destined for life in the World-to-Come,</b> as your portion is already in eternal life. |
| Psalms 19:15 | “May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You” | Berakhot 4b:14 | <b>They say</b> in response: <b>Since the Sages instituted</b> the practice of reciting: <b>Help us lie down, it is considered one extended blessing of redemption,</b> and therefore does not constitute an interruption. <b>As if you fail to say</b> that the sections added by the Sages are considered no less significant than the original prayers, <b>then can one juxtapose redemption to prayer</b> even <b>in the morning? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Before</b> every prayer <b>one recites</b> the verse: <b>“Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory”</b> (Psalms 51:17) as a prelude to prayer? <b>Afterward, one recites</b> the verse: <b>“May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You”</b> (Psalms 19:15). Doesn’t the verse: Lord, open my lips, constitute an interruption between redemption and prayer? |
| Psalms 19:15 | be acceptable | Berakhot 9b:19 | In practice, the Gemara asks: <b>How is one able to juxtapose redemption and prayer? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: At the beginning</b> of prayer, <b>one says: “Lord, open my lips,</b> that my mouth may declare Your glory” (Psalms 51:17), <b>and at the end</b> of prayer one says: <b>“May the words of my mouth</b> and the meditation of my heart <b>be acceptable</b> before You, Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer” (Psalms 19:15). If so, the first verse is an interruption between redemption and prayer. |
| Psalms 20:2 | that which is written: “The Lord will answer you on the day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob set you upon high” | Berakhot 64a:6 | <b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The Lord will answer you on the day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob set you upon high”</b> (Psalms 20:2)? Is God specifically <b>the God of Jacob and not the God of Abraham and Isaac?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> the general principle is derived: <b>One who owns a beam should approach</b> carrying <b>the thick portion of the beam.</b> A builder, carrying a beam in order to affix it in a building, must calibrate it and measure carefully so that the thick part of the beam fits in its place; so too must Jacob, who fathered and raised the children who would become the people of Israel, continue to pray for them and complete the task of nation-building. |
| Psalms 24:1 | Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s, | Berakhot 35a:21 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s,</b> the world and all those who live in it” (Psalms 24:1). Rabbi Levi expressed this concept differently. <b>Rabbi Levi raised a contradiction: It is written: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s,” and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The heavens are the Lord’s and the earth He has given over to mankind”</b> (Psalms 115:16). There is clearly a contradiction with regard to whom the earth belongs. He himself resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult.

| Psalms 26:6 | to him as if he built an altar and offered a sacrifice upon it, as it is written: “I will wash in purity my hands, and I will encircle the altar of the Lord” | Berakhot 15a:2 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who relieves himself, washes his hands, dons phylacteries, recites <i>Shema</i>, and prays, the verse ascribes</b> credit <b>to him as if he built an altar and offered a sacrifice upon it, as it is written: “I will wash in purity my hands, and I will encircle the altar of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 26:6). <b>Rava said to him: Do you not maintain, Master,</b> that one who does so, <b>it is as if he immersed</b> his entire body, <b>as it is written: “I will wash in purity,” and it is not written: “I will wash my hands”?</b> |
| Psalms 27:13 | believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” | Berakhot 4a:14 | With regard to David’s statement, “Keep my soul, for I am pious,” the Gemara asks: <b>Did David call himself pious? Isn’t it written: “If I had not [<i>luleh</i></b>] <b>believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living”</b> (Psalms 27:13). The dots that appear over the word <i>luleh</i> in the text indicate doubt and uncertainty of his piety, and whether he was deserving of a place in the land of the living (see <i>Avot DeRabbi Natan</i> 34). <b>In the name of Rabbi Yosei, it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Why</b> do <b>dots</b> appear <b>over the word <i>luleh</i>,</b> as if there are some reservations? Because <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe. I</b> have every <b>confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the World-to-Come</b> since God’s ultimate goodness is manifest in the land of eternal life, <b>but</b> I still harbor uncertainty with regard to myself, and <b>I do not know whether or not I</b> definitely <b>have a portion among them.</b> In any case, apparently David was uncertain whether or not he deserved to receive a portion of God’s reward for the righteous; how, then, could he characterize himself as pious? |
| Psalms 27:14 | pray again, as it is stated: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord” | Berakhot 32b:10 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: A person who prayed and saw that he was not answered</b> should <b>pray again, as it is stated: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord”</b> (Psalms 27:14). One should turn to God with hope, and if necessary turn to God again with hope. |
| Psalms 29:2 | bow to the Lord in the beauty of holiness [ behadrat kodesh ]” | Berakhot 30b:18 | The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps David is different, as he would excessively afflict himself in prayer</b> in order to atone for his transgression with Bathsheba. Consequently, his cannot serve as a paradigm for proper conduct in prayer. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said,</b> it can be derived <b>from here,</b> from this verse that David said, not about his own worship, but about worship of God in general: “Give, unto the Lord, the honor of His name, <b>bow to the Lord in the beauty of holiness [<i>behadrat kodesh</i>]”</b> (Psalms 29:2). <b>Do not read: In the beauty of [<i>behadrat</i>]</b> holiness. <b>Rather</b> read: <b>In trembling of [<i>beḥerdat</i>]</b> holiness; one must enter into prayer from an atmosphere of gravity engendered by sanctity. |
| Psalms 29:11 | “May the Lord give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace” | Berakhot 64a:14 | The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>].</b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you. For the sake of the House of the Lord, our God, I will seek your good”</b> (Psalms 122:8–9), and <b>“May the Lord give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 29:11 | refers to phylacteries, as it is stated: “The Lord gave strength to His nation” | Berakhot 6a:18 | Specifically, <b>“His right hand” refers to the Torah, as it is stated</b> in describing the giving of the Torah: <b>“From His right hand, a fiery law for His people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>“The arm of His strength,”</b> His left hand, <b>refers to phylacteries, as it is stated: “The Lord gave strength to His nation”</b> (Psalms 29:11), in the form of the mitzva of phylacteries. |
| Psalms 30:6 | angry for a moment? As it is stated: “His anger is but for a moment, His favor, for a lifetime” | Berakhot 7a:15 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that God <b>is</b> only <b>angry for a moment? As it is stated: “His anger is but for a moment, His favor, for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead, <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. |
| Psalms 30:12 | You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness” | Berakhot 55b:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Three transformations:</b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing;</b><br><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12);<br><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together;</b><br><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12);<br>and: <b>“Nevertheless the Lord your God would not hearken unto Balaam;</b><br><b>but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). |
| Psalms 31:6 | Abaye said: Even a Torah scholar must recite at least one verse of prayer, such as: “Into Your hand I trust my spirit; You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth” | Berakhot 5a:1 | <b>If one is a Torah scholar, he need not</b> recite <i>Shema</i> on his bed since he is always engaged in the study of Torah and will likely fall asleep engrossed in matters of Torah. <b>Abaye said: Even a Torah scholar must recite at least one verse of prayer, such as: “Into Your hand I trust my spirit; You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth”</b> (Psalms 31:6). |
| Psalms 31:13 | as it is stated: “I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a lost vessel” | Berakhot 58b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees his friend after thirty days</b> have passed since last seeing him <b>recites: Blessed…Who has given us life, sustained us and brought us to this time.</b> One who sees his friend <b>after twelve months recites: Blessed…Who revives the dead.</b> As <b>Rav said: A dead person is only forgotten from the heart after twelve months</b> have elapsed, <b>as it is stated: “I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a lost vessel”</b> (Psalms 31:13), and with regard to the laws of lost objects, it is human nature to despair of recovering a lost object after twelve months (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 28a). |
| Psalms 32:1 | Rav Kahana also said: I consider impudent one who specifies his transgression, as it is stated: “Happy is he whose iniquity is forgiven, whose transgression is covered over” | Berakhot 34b:31 | Employing parallel language, <b>Rav Kahana also said: I consider impudent one who specifies his transgression, as it is stated: “Happy is he whose iniquity is forgiven, whose transgression is covered over”</b> (Psalms 32:1); one who conceals his transgressions indicates that he is ashamed of them, and due to his shame he will be forgiven. |
| Psalms 32:6 | “For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding, | Berakhot 8a:9 | Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Gemara seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding,</b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife,</b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22). |
| Psalms 34:3 | “Praise God with me | Berakhot 48b:6 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is not necessary</b> to interpret the verse this way; rather, it should be understood in a slightly different manner, as follows: <b>“And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless,” that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all; <b>however, the <i>zimmun</i> blessing is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“Praise God with me</b> and we will exalt His name together” (Psalms 34:3). He continues: <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land. Good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: This good mountain and Lebanon. They instituted</b> the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, at Yavne</b> and, as such, it has no biblical source. However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>The verse states: That he gave you.</b> A blessing must be recited over food <b>from</b> the moment that God <b>gave it to you,</b> not only afterward. |
| Psalms 34:4 | Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together” | Berakhot 45a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the basic mitzva of <i>zimmun</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived<b>,</b> that after a meal in which three diners participated, a <i>zimmun</i> must be recited? <b>Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together”</b> (Psalms 34:4), i.e., the one reciting the blessing turns to at least two others to praise God together. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The source of the mitzva of <i>zimmun</i> is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>here: “When I call the Name of the Lord, give</b> [plural] <b>praise to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3). |
| Psalms 34:15 | greet him first, as it is stated: “Seek peace and pursue it” | Berakhot 6b:37 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who is aware that another</b> person <b>is accustomed to greet him</b> is not only obligated to return his greeting, but <b>he</b> must <b>greet him first, as it is stated: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>If</b> the other person <b>extended</b> his <b>greeting to him and he did not respond, he is called a robber, as it is stated: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard, the spoils of the poor is in your houses”</b> (Isaiah 3:14). The only way to steal from a pauper who owns nothing is to rob him of his dignity by refusing to return his greeting. |
| Psalms 35:10 | As it is written: “All of my bones shall say: Lord, who is like You” | Berakhot 25a:4 | <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: He is prohibited from reciting <i>Shema</i>. What is the reason for Rav Ḥisda’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “All of my bones shall say: Lord, who is like You”</b> (Psalms 35:10). Since this praise is undertaken with one’s entire body, he may not recite <i>Shema</i> even if just one limb is not appropriately clean. |
| Psalms 35:13 | “But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, | Berakhot 12b:8 | The Gemara seeks to clarify the source of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need of mercy? <b>If you say</b> that it is <b>because</b> of what Saul said to his men, <b>as it is written: “And there is none of you that is ill over me or tells unto me”</b> (I Samuel 22:8), meaning that because Saul was a Torah scholar, it would have been appropriate for people to make themselves ill worrying about him; this is not an absolute proof. <b>Perhaps a king is different,</b> and excessive worry is appropriate in that case. Rather, proof that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need for mercy is <b>from here:</b> When David speaks of his enemies, Doeg and Ahitophel, who were Torah scholars, he says: <b>“But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth,</b> I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Psalms 35:13). One must be concerned to the extent that he dresses in sackcloth and fasts for the recovery of a Torah scholar. |
| Psalms 36:2 | evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes” | Berakhot 61b:2 | With regard to one’s inclinations, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart. The <b>evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes”</b> (Psalms 36:2). <b>Middling people are ruled by both</b> the good and evil inclinations, <b>as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul”</b> (Psalms 109:31). |
| Psalms 37:1 | written: “Do not compete with evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust” | Berakhot 7b:16 | <b>That</b> statement <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita,</i> as <b>Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Matun, says: One is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness,</b> and the keepers of the Torah will fight them.” <b>And if someone whispered to you, saying,</b> on the contrary, <b>isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “Do not compete with evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust”</b> (Psalms 37:1), meaning that one should avoid provoking the wicked, <b>say to him:</b> Only <b>one whose heart strikes him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he committed <b>says this. Rather,</b> the true meaning of the verse is: <b>Do not compete with evil-doers, to be like the evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust to be like the unjust.</b> |
| Psalms 39:3 | and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong” | Berakhot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren,</b> who learn only the Written Torah, <b>know this</b> concept <b>as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>Rather,</b> one must interpret the verse: <b>Anyone who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>yet does not engage</b> in that study, not only does <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> fail to protect him, but He <b>brings upon him hideous afflictions,</b> that embarrass him <b>and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong”</b> (Psalms 39:3). The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong.” |
| Psalms 39:13 | as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears” | Berakhot 32b:5 | On the subject of prayer, <b>Rabbi Elazar also said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the gates of prayer were locked</b> and prayer is not accepted as it once was, <b>as it is said</b> in lamentation of the Temple’s destruction: <b>“Though I plead and call out, He shuts out my prayer”</b> (Lamentations 3:8). Yet, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that the gates of prayer were locked</b> with the destruction of the Temple, <b>the gates of tears were not locked,</b> and one who cries before God may rest assured that his prayers will be answered, <b>as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears”</b> (Psalms 39:13). Since this prayer is a request that God should pay heed to the tears of one who is praying, he is certain that at least the gates of tears are not locked. |
| Psalms 46:9 | the verse says: “Go, see the works of the Lord, who has made desolations [ shamot ] upon the earth” | Berakhot 7b:10 | Regarding the basic assumption that these homiletic interpretations of names are allusions to one’s future, the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that the name affects</b> one’s life? <b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that <b>the verse says: “Go, see the works of the Lord, who has made desolations [<i>shamot</i>] upon the earth”</b> (Psalms 46:9). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>shamot</i>, rather</b> as <b><i>shemot</i>, names.</b> The names given to people are, therefore, “the works of the Lord upon the earth.” |
| Psalms 51:17 | “Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory” | Berakhot 4b:14 | <b>They say</b> in response: <b>Since the Sages instituted</b> the practice of reciting: <b>Help us lie down, it is considered one extended blessing of redemption,</b> and therefore does not constitute an interruption. <b>As if you fail to say</b> that the sections added by the Sages are considered no less significant than the original prayers, <b>then can one juxtapose redemption to prayer</b> even <b>in the morning? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Before</b> every prayer <b>one recites</b> the verse: <b>“Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory”</b> (Psalms 51:17) as a prelude to prayer? <b>Afterward, one recites</b> the verse: <b>“May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You”</b> (Psalms 19:15). Doesn’t the verse: Lord, open my lips, constitute an interruption between redemption and prayer? |
| Psalms 51:17 | one says: “Lord, open my lips, | Berakhot 9b:19 | In practice, the Gemara asks: <b>How is one able to juxtapose redemption and prayer? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: At the beginning</b> of prayer, <b>one says: “Lord, open my lips,</b> that my mouth may declare Your glory” (Psalms 51:17), <b>and at the end</b> of prayer one says: <b>“May the words of my mouth</b> and the meditation of my heart <b>be acceptable</b> before You, Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer” (Psalms 19:15). If so, the first verse is an interruption between redemption and prayer. |
| Psalms 55:18 | written: “Evening and morning and afternoon | Berakhot 20b:5 | We also learned in the mishna that women, slaves, and children are <b>obligated in prayer.</b> The Gemara explains that, although the mitzva of prayer is only in effect at particular times, which would lead to the conclusion that women are exempt, nevertheless, since prayer <b>is</b> supplication for <b>mercy</b> and women also require divine mercy, they are obligated. However, <b>lest you say: Since</b> regarding prayer it is <b>written: “Evening and morning and afternoon</b> I pray and cry aloud and He hears my voice” (Psalms 55:18), perhaps prayer should be <b>considered a time-bound, positive mitzva</b> and women would be exempt, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that, fundamentally, the mitzva of prayer is not time-bound and, therefore, everyone is obligated. |
| Psalms 55:18 | as it is written: “Evening and morning and noon, | Berakhot 31a:23 | Daniel does not describe how these three prayers are distributed during the day. I <b>might have</b> thought <b>that one may include all</b> three prayers <b>at one time; it has already been articulated by David</b> that one may not do so, <b>as it is written: “Evening and morning and noon,</b> I pray and cry aloud and He hears my voice” (Psalms 55:18). |
| Psalms 55:19 | “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me; | Berakhot 55b:9 | <b>And three redemptions, as it is written:</b><br><b>“He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me;</b> for they were many that strove with me” (Psalms 55:19);<br><b>“The redeemed of the Lord shall return,</b> and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;<br>they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35:10);<br>and: <b>“The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation</b> in Israel?<br>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not” (I Samuel 14:45). |
| Psalms 56:11 | “In God, I will praise His word; in the Lord, I will praise His word” | Berakhot 60b:9 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said:</b> The proof is <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“In God, I will praise His word; in the Lord, I will praise His word”</b> (Psalms 56:11). The Gemara explains that <b>In God, I will praise His word; that is</b> the revelation of God’s <b>attribute of benevolence,</b> while: <b>In the Lord, I will praise His word; that is the attribute of suffering;</b> even if God brings suffering to bear upon me, I will still praise Him. |
| Psalms 57:1 | a mikhtam of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave” | Berakhot 10a:8 | In explaining passages from Psalms, the Gemara relates another instance of a response to the question of a heretic: <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1), <b>and</b> similarly <b>it is said:</b> “To the chief musician, <i>al tashḥet</i>, <b>a <i>mikhtam</i> of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave”</b> (Psalms 57:1). <b>Which event was first? Since the event with Saul was first,</b> it would have been appropriate <b>to write it first.</b> |
| Psalms 57:9 | “Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will wake the dawn” | Berakhot 4a:3 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Adda, and some say Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> From <b>what verse</b> is it derived that David’s lyre would wake him at midnight? <b>“Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will wake the dawn”</b> (Psalms 57:9). This means that the playing lyre has already woken, and now I must engage in Torah study until dawn. |
| Psalms 63:5 | that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands” | Berakhot 16b:17 | The Gemara cites an aggadic statement concerning prayer and the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands”</b> (Psalms 63:5)? <b>So I will bless You as I live, refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> and <b>to Your name I will raise my hands, refers to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> which is characterized as lifting one’s hands to God. <b>And if one does so,</b> recites <i>Shema</i> and prays, <b>the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied”</b> (Psalms 63:6). <b>And not only</b> does he receive this reward, <b>but he inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “With lips of joys [<i>renanot</i>], my mouth praises You”</b> (Psalms 63:6). The plural, joys, refers to two joys, that of this world and that of the World-to-Come. |
| Psalms 63:6 | the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied” | Berakhot 16b:17 | The Gemara cites an aggadic statement concerning prayer and the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands”</b> (Psalms 63:5)? <b>So I will bless You as I live, refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> and <b>to Your name I will raise my hands, refers to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> which is characterized as lifting one’s hands to God. <b>And if one does so,</b> recites <i>Shema</i> and prays, <b>the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied”</b> (Psalms 63:6). <b>And not only</b> does he receive this reward, <b>but he inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “With lips of joys [<i>renanot</i>], my mouth praises You”</b> (Psalms 63:6). The plural, joys, refers to two joys, that of this world and that of the World-to-Come. |
| Psalms 66:12 | it is as if he was punished with two punishments: Fire and water. As it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and water” | Berakhot 6b:25 | <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi both said:</b> One who becomes dependent upon others, <b>it is as if he was punished with two punishments: Fire and water. As it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and water”</b> (Psalms 66:12). |
| Psalms 66:20 | of prayer, as it is stated: “Blessed is God Who did not turn away my prayer” | Berakhot 5a:15 | <b>And one said: Afflictions of love are any that do not cause dereliction</b> in the recitation <b>of prayer, as it is stated: “Blessed is God Who did not turn away my prayer”</b> (Psalms 66:20). Despite his suffering, the afflicted is still capable of praying to God. |
| Psalms 68:13 | as it is written: “And she who tarries at home divides the spoils” | Berakhot 9b:4 | <b>The one who said</b> that it was given <b>against the will of the Egyptians</b> cites the verse describing Israel’s exit from Egypt, <b>as it is written: “And she who tarries at home divides the spoils”</b> (Psalms 68:13). That which the woman in the verse requested from her counterpart was actually spoils taken against the will of an enemy. <b>The one who said</b> that it was given <b>against the will of Israel,</b> claims that they did not want the vessels <b>because of the</b> burden of carrying a heavy <b>load</b> on a long journey. |
| Psalms 68:14 | Because the community of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is written: “The wings of a dove, covered in silver, and its pinions with the shimmer of gold” | Berakhot 53b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a <b>dove,</b> that he specifically said that that was the object that he forgot? The Gemara answers: <b>Because the community of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is written: “The wings of a dove, covered in silver, and its pinions with the shimmer of gold”</b> (Psalms 68:14). The Gemara explains the parable: <b>Just as a dove is saved</b> from its enemies <b>only by its wings, so too, Israel is saved only by</b> the merit of the <b>mitzvot.</b> |
| Psalms 68:15 | its letters, Gehenna is cooled for him, as it is stated: “When the Almighty scatters [ befares ] kings over it, it will snow in Tzalmon” | Berakhot 15b:29 | On this same topic, <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> and is punctilious in</b> enunciating <b>its letters, Gehenna is cooled for him, as it is stated: “When the Almighty scatters [<i>befares</i>] kings over it, it will snow in Tzalmon”</b> (Psalms 68:15). <b>Do not read <i>befares</i>,</b> When He scatters, <b>but <i>befaresh</i>,</b> When he enunciates. When one enunciates the name of God with precision, God will fulfill the verse: It will snow in Tzalmon, on his behalf. <b>Do not read <i>beTzalmon</i>,</b> in Tzalmon, <b>but <i>betzalmavet</i>,</b> in the shadow of death, a reference to Gehenna. As reward for enunciating God’s name precisely, God will cool Gehenna for him. |
| Psalms 68:20 | The verse says: “Blessed is the Lord, day by day” | Berakhot 40a:10 | We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that one recites over herbs and leafy greens: <b>Who creates various kinds of herbs. Rabbi Zeira, and some say Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa, said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Zeira, and some say Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa, said: What is the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion? <b>The verse says: “Blessed is the Lord, day by day”</b> (Psalms 68:20). The question arises: <b>Is it so that one blesses Him by day and does not bless Him at night? Rather,</b> the verse comes <b>to tell you: Each and every day, give the Lord</b> the appropriate <b>blessings</b> for that day. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the blessings recited over food, for <b>each and every type</b> of food, <b>give the</b> Lord the appropriate blessings for that food. |
| Psalms 68:21 | as it is stated: “Issues [ totzaot ] of death” | Berakhot 8a:12 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The time of finding</b> refers to <b>death.</b> One should pray that when death comes, he will leave the world peacefully, <b>as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death”</b> (Psalms 68:21). Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement is based on the etymological similarity between <i>totzaot</i> and <i>matza</i>, finding. |
| Psalms 68:27 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: According to the size of the crowd, they recite the blessing, as it is stated: “Bless you God in full assemblies, even the Lord, you who are from the fountain of Israel” | Berakhot 49b:15 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: According to the size of the crowd, they recite the blessing, as it is stated: “Bless you God in full assemblies, even the Lord, you who are from the fountain of Israel”</b> (Psalms 68:27). <b>Rabbi Akiva said</b> that there are no distinctions based on the size of the crowd: <b>What do we find in the synagogue? Both</b> when there are <b>many and</b> when there are <b>few,</b> as long as there is a quorum of ten, the prayer leader <b>says: Bless [<i>barekhu</i>] the Lord. Rabbi Yishmael said</b> that in the synagogue, one recites: <b>Bless the Lord the blessed One.</b> |
| Psalms 68:27 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: According to the size of the crowd, they recite the blessing, as it is stated: “Bless you God in full assemblies, | Berakhot 50a:11 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as these two statements are the opinions of different Sages. <b>This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, and that is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: According to the size of the crowd, they recite the blessing, as it is stated: “Bless you God in full assemblies,</b> even the Lord, you who are from the fountain of Israel” (Psalms 68:27). We also learned in our mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva said</b> that there are no distinctions based on the size of the crowd: <b>What do we find in the synagogue?</b> Both when there are many and when there are few, as long as there is a quorum of ten, the prayer leader says: Bless the Lord. In the case of Grace after Meals as well, the formula remains the same regardless of the number of people participating in the <i>zimmun</i>. |
| Psalms 69:14 | that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor; | Berakhot 8a:1 | <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor;</b> O God, in the abundance of Your mercy, answer me with the truth of Your salvation” (Psalms 69:14)? It appears that the individual is praying that his prayers will coincide with a special time of Divine favor. <b>When is a time of favor?</b> It is <b>at the time when the congregation is praying.</b> It is beneficial to pray together with the congregation, for God does not fail to respond to the entreaties of the congregation. |
| Psalms 71:8 | because it is stated: “My mouth will be filled with Your praise” | Berakhot 51a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to a</b> food <b>item that does not become disgusting as well, let him shift it to the side and recite the blessing.</b> Why need he spit it out? <b>Rav Yitzḥak Kaskesa’a explained before Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> One spits it out <b>because it is stated: “My mouth will be filled with Your praise”</b> (Psalms 71:8), meaning that one should recite God’s praises with his entire mouth, not merely half. |
| Psalms 72:5 | “Let them fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation after generation” | Berakhot 29b:9 | The brothers, <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin, both said:</b> One whose prayer is fixed refers to <b>anyone who does not</b> make the effort to <b>pray with the reddening of the sun,</b> just after sunrise and just before sunset, which are auspicious times for prayer. As <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is a mitzva to pray with the reddening of the sun. And Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Let them fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation after generation”</b> (Psalms 72:5). Prayer, the manifestation of the fear of God, should be undertaken adjacent to sunrise and sunset. Nevertheless, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they cursed one who prays with the reddening of the sun</b>, adjacent to sunset. <b>What is the reason? Perhaps,</b> due to preoccupation, he will become <b>confused about the hour</b> and the time for prayer will pass. |
| Psalms 72:5 | “They shall fear You with the sun, and before the moon for all generations” | Berakhot 9b:15 | Regarding this custom of the <i>vatikin</i>, <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What verse</b> is the source for this tradition? <b>“They shall fear You with the sun, and before the moon for all generations”</b> (Psalms 72:5). This verse indicates that one should express one’s awe of Heaven, they shall fear You, immediately before sunrise, with the sun. |
| Psalms 77:19 | as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook” | Berakhot 59a:7 | We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna that <b>over thunder</b> one recites: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> causes <b>thunder? Shmuel said:</b> When the <b>clouds</b> located <b>in the curvature</b> of the firmament collide with the firmament itself, they produce this sound, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook”</b> (Psalms 77:19). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Thunder is the sound of <b>clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Thunder is caused by <b>a powerful lightning bolt that flashes in the cloud and shatters the hailstones. Rav Ashi said:</b> Because the <b>clouds are hollow, and</b> when <b>the wind comes and blows across their mouths,</b> it sounds like <b>wind blowing in the mouth of a jug.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov; as lightning flashes, the clouds rumble, and the rain comes.</b> |
| Psalms 81:11 | “Open your mouth wide, that I will fill it” | Berakhot 50a:4 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Isn’t it written</b> that King David articulated his prayer in that manner: “Be pleased, therefore, to bless Your servant’s house, that it abide before You forever; for You, Lord God, have spoken. <b>And from Your blessing may Your servant’s house be blessed forever”</b> (II Samuel 7:29). David said: From Your blessing. The Gemara answers: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request it is different,</b> as it is inappropriate to demand the full bounty of God’s blessing. The Gemara questions this: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request, too, is it not written</b> that a request for the full bounty of God’s blessing is granted: <b>“Open your mouth wide, that I will fill it”</b> (Psalms 81:11)? What one receives corresponds to what he requests. The Gemara answered: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> where it is wholly appropriate to make excessive requests. |
| Psalms 82:1 | that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is located in a synagogue? As it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God; | Berakhot 6a:8 | In explaining Abba Binyamin’s statement, <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is located in a synagogue? As it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God;</b> in the midst of the judges He judges” (Psalms 82:1). The congregation of God is the place where people congregate to sing God’s praises, and God is located among His congregation. |
| Psalms 84:5 | the verse states: “Happy are those who dwell in Your House” | Berakhot 32b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> This is alluded to when <b>the verse states: “Happy are those who dwell in Your House”</b> (Psalms 84:5), immediately after which it is said: “They will yet praise You, Selah.” |
| Psalms 84:8 | is privileged to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion” | Berakhot 64a:11 | <b>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥiyya said: One who leaves the synagogue and</b> immediately <b>enters the study hall and engages in Torah</b> study, <b>is privileged to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion”</b> (Psalms 84:8); those who go from a place of prayer to a place of Torah study are privileged to receive a divine revelation in Zion. |
| Psalms 85:14 | Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: A person is prohibited to attend to his own affairs before he prays, as it is stated: “Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps on a path” | Berakhot 14a:16 | <b>And as Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: A person is prohibited to attend to his own affairs before he prays, as it is stated: “Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps on a path”</b> (Psalms 85:14). One should first pray and acknowledge the righteousness of his Creator, and only then should he set out on his way. |
| Psalms 87:2 | “The Lord loves the gates of Zion [ Tziyyon ] more than all the dwellings of Jacob” | Berakhot 8a:17 | Rafram <b>said to him, Rav Ḥisda said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“The Lord loves the gates of Zion [<i>Tziyyon</i>] more than all the dwellings of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 87:2)? This means that <b>the Lord loves the gates distinguished [<i>metzuyanim</i>] through</b> the study of <i>halakha</i> as they are the gates of Zion, the outstanding gates, <b>more than the synagogues and study halls.</b> Although those places are the most outstanding of the dwellings of Jacob, they are not engaged in the study of <i>halakha</i>. |
| Psalms 91:7 | to his left and ten thousand to his right. | Berakhot 6a:4 | <b>Rav Huna said: Each and every one of us has a thousand</b> demons <b>to his left and ten thousand to his right.</b> God protects man from these demons, as it says in the verse: “A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; they will not approach you” (Psalms 91:7). |
| Psalms 91:10 | Is it not written: “No evil shall befall you, | Berakhot 55b:5 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is it not written: “No evil shall befall you,</b> neither shall any plague come near your tent” (Psalms 91:10)? <b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> in explanation of that verse: This means <b>that you will be frightened neither by bad dreams nor by evil thoughts. Neither shall any plague come near your tent,</b> means <b>that you will never find your wife</b> with the <b>uncertain</b> status of a <b>menstruating woman when you return from a journey.</b> This proves that it is impossible that a righteous person will experience bad dreams throughout his life. <b>Rather,</b> one might say that <b>he does not see</b> bad dreams; <b>others see</b> bad dreams about him. |
| Psalms 92:3 | as it is stated: “To declare Your kindness in the morning and Your faith in the nights” | Berakhot 12a:23 | <b>Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava said in the name of Rav: One who did not recite: True and Firm [<i>emet veyatziv</i>]</b> at the beginning of the blessing of redemption that follows <i>Shema</i> <b>in the morning prayer, and: True and Trustworthy [<i>emet ve’emuna</i>] in the evening prayer, he did not fulfill his obligation.</b> An allusion to the difference in formulation between morning and evening is, <b>as it is stated: “To declare Your kindness in the morning and Your faith in the nights”</b> (Psalms 92:3). In the morning, one must mention God’s loving-kindness, while in the evening one is required to emphasize the aspect of faith. |
| Psalms 94:1 | revenge that was placed between two letters, as it is stated: “God of vengeance, Lord, | Berakhot 33a:22 | <b>Rav Aḥa Karḥina’a strongly objects to this</b> approach that being placed between two names of God accords significance: <b>However, if so,</b> the same should hold true for vengeance. <b>Great</b> is <b>revenge that was placed between two letters, as it is stated: “God of vengeance, Lord,</b> God of vengeance shine forth” (Psalms 94:1). |
| Psalms 94:1 | in ruins he recites: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance, shine forth” | Berakhot 58b:1 | <b>The Sages taught: One who sees the houses of Israel inhabited</b> and tranquil <b>recites: Blessed…Who establishes the border of the widow.</b> One who sees them <b>in ruins he recites: Blessed…the true Judge.</b> One who sees <b>the houses of the nations of the world inhabited recites: “The Lord will destroy the house of the proud,</b> but He will establish the border of the widow” (Proverbs 15:25). <b>And</b> if he sees them <b>in ruins he recites: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance, shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1). |
| Psalms 94:12 | as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law” | Berakhot 5a:9 | Previously, the Gemara discussed suffering that results from one’s transgressions. The Gemara shifts the focus and discusses suffering that does not result from one’s transgressions and the suffering of the righteous. <b>Rava, and some say Rav Ḥisda, said: If a person sees that suffering has befallen him, he should examine his actions.</b> Generally, suffering comes about as punishment for one’s transgressions, <b>as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God”</b> (Lamentations 3:40). <b>If he examined</b> his ways and <b>found no</b> transgression for which that suffering is appropriate, <b>he may attribute</b> his suffering <b>to dereliction</b> in the study <b>of Torah.</b> God punishes an individual for dereliction in the study of Torah in order to emphasize the gravity of the issue, <b>as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law”</b> (Psalms 94:12). This verse teaches us that his suffering will cause him to return to Your law. |
| Psalms 99:6 | men. And who were they? Moses and Aaron. As it is stated: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name” | Berakhot 31b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“an offspring of men”? Rav said:</b> Hannah prayed for <b>a man among men,</b> a son who would be outstanding and exceptional. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> This expression means <b>an offspring who will anoint two men</b> to royalty. <b>And who were they? Saul and David. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Hannah prayed that she would bear <b>an offspring who</b> would be <b>the equivalent of two</b> of the world’s greatest <b>men. And who were they? Moses and Aaron. As it is stated: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name”</b> (Psalms 99:6). In this verse, Hannah’s son, Samuel, is equated to Moses and Aaron. <b>And the Rabbis say: “An offspring of men”:</b> Hannah prayed for <b>an offspring who would be inconspicuous among men,</b> that he would not stand out in any way. |
| Psalms 101:1 | “I will sing of loving-kindness and justice; unto You, O Lord, will I sing praises” | Berakhot 60b:8 | <b>Rav Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Levi: What</b> is the <b>verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“I will sing of loving-kindness and justice; unto You, O Lord, will I sing praises”</b> (Psalms 101:1). Rav Aḥa explains: <b>If</b> it is <b>loving-kindness, I will sing, and if</b> it is <b>justice, I will sing.</b> I will thank God in song for the bad just as for the good. |
| Psalms 102:1 | in a low place and pray, for there is no haughtiness before God. As it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths” and it is written: “A prayer for the impoverished, when he is faint | Berakhot 10b:27 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One should neither stand upon a chair nor upon a stool, nor in a high place and pray. Rather,</b> one should stand <b>in a low place and pray, for there is no haughtiness before God. As it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths” and it is written: “A prayer for the impoverished, when he is faint</b> and pours out his complaint before God” (Psalms 102:1). It is appropriate to feel impoverished when praying and make one’s requests humbly. |
| Psalms 102:1 | nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [ siḥo ] before the Lord” | Berakhot 26b:6 | <b>Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [<i>lasuaḥ</i>] in the field toward evening”</b> (Genesis 24:63), <b>and conversation</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [<i>siḥo</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Psalms 102:1). Obviously, Isaac was the first to pray as evening approached, at the time of the afternoon prayer. |
| Psalms 103:1 | Bless the Lord, O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name” | Berakhot 10a:13 | <b>He resided in his mother’s womb,</b> his first world, <b>and said a song</b> of praise of the pregnancy, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Of David. <b>Bless the Lord, O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name”</b> (Psalms 103:1), in which he thanks God for creating all that is within his mother, i.e., her womb. |
| Psalms 103:2 | as it is stated: “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and do not forget all His benefits [ gemulav ]” | Berakhot 10a:15 | <b>He nursed from his mother’s breast,</b> his third world, <b>and he looked upon her bosom and said a song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and do not forget all His benefits [<i>gemulav</i>]”</b> (Psalms 103:2). The etymological association is between <i>gemulav</i> and <i>gemulei meḥalav</i>, which means weaned from milk (Isaiah 28:9). |
| Psalms 104:1 | as it is stated: “Bless the Lord, O my soul. Lord my God, You are very great; You are clothed in glory and majesty” | Berakhot 10a:19 | The fifth world was when David <b>looked upon the day of death and said a song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: “Bless the Lord, O my soul. Lord my God, You are very great; You are clothed in glory and majesty”</b> (Psalms 104:1); for even death is a time of transcendence for the righteous. |
| Psalms 104:15 | and bread fills man’s heart” | Berakhot 35b:19 | Again, the Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> wine <b>satisfy at all? Isn’t it written: “Wine gladdens the heart of man,</b> making the face brighter than oil, <b>and bread fills man’s heart”</b> (Psalms 104:15); <b>bread is that which satisfies, wine does not satisfy. Rather,</b> this verse is not a proof; <b>wine has two</b> advantages, <b>it satisfies and gladdens. Bread,</b> however, <b>satisfies but does not gladden.</b> |
| Psalms 104:15 | for him, as it is stated: “And wine that makes glad the heart of man” | Berakhot 57a:21 | The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan taught: One who sees any kind of drink in a dream it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen, <b>except for wine,</b> as <b>there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is</b> one <b>who drinks</b> wine <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15), <b>and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul”</b> (Proverbs 31:6). |
| Psalms 104:29 | it is written: “You hide Your face, they vanish; You gather Your breath, they perish | Berakhot 10a:20 | The connection between this final praise and the day of death is unclear. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is it inferred</b> that <b>this</b> verse <b>was stated with regard to the day of death?</b> Rabba bar Rav Sheila says: We can derive this <b>from</b> the verses at <b>the end of the matter,</b> where <b>it is written: “You hide Your face, they vanish; You gather Your breath, they perish</b> and return to the dust” (Psalms 104:29). |
| Psalms 104:35 | as it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul, Halleluya ” | Berakhot 10a:18 | <b>He witnessed</b> in both vision and reality <b>the downfall of the wicked and he said a song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul, <i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 104:35). |
| Psalms 104:35 | as it is written: “Let sins cease from the land” | Berakhot 10a:2 | With regard to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, that David did not say <i>Halleluya</i> until he saw the downfall of the wicked, the Gemara relates: <b>There were these hooligans in Rabbi Meir’s neighborhood who caused him a great deal of anguish. Rabbi Meir prayed for</b> God to have <b>mercy on them, that they should die. Rabbi Meir’s wife, Berurya, said to him: What is your thinking?</b> On what basis do you pray for the death of these hooligans? Do you base yourself on the verse, <b>as it is written: “Let sins cease from the land”</b> (Psalms 104:35), which you interpret to mean that the world would be better if the wicked were destroyed? But <b>is it written,</b> let <b>sinners</b> cease?” Let <b>sins</b> cease, <b>is written.</b> One should pray for an end to their transgressions, not for the demise of the transgressors themselves. |
| Psalms 104:35 | As it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, my soul, Halleluya ” | Berakhot 9b:29 | The Gemara cites proof that the first two chapters are in fact a single chapter. <b>As Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said: David said one hundred and three chapters, and he did not say <i>Halleluya</i></b> in any of them <b>until he saw the downfall of the wicked.</b> Only then could David say <i>Halleluya</i> wholeheartedly. <b>As it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, my soul, <i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 104:35). |
| Psalms 106:23 | is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them” | Berakhot 10b:12 | The Gemara cites proof from Moses. When he prayed to God for forgiveness after the incident of the Golden Calf, <b>he based</b> his request <b>upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants,</b> to whom You swore upon Yourself, and told them: I will increase your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and all of this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants and they will inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13). Yet when this story is related, God’s forgiveness of Israel <b>is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them”</b> (Psalms 106:23). |
| Psalms 106:30 | as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood up and prayed | Berakhot 26b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: Abraham instituted the morning prayer, as it is stated</b> when Abraham came to look out over Sodom the day after he had prayed on its behalf: <b>“And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before the Lord” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> from the context as well as the language utilized in the verse, the verb <b>standing</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer,</b> as this language is used to describe Pinehas’ prayer after the plague, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood up and prayed</b> and the plague ended” (Psalms 106:30). Clearly, Abraham was accustomed to stand in prayer in the morning. |
| Psalms 106:30 | “standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed” | Berakhot 6b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that Abraham our father set a fixed place</b> for his prayer? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before God” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> the verb <b>“standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed”</b> (Psalms 106:30). |
| Psalms 107:4 | “They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city in which to dwell” | Berakhot 54b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>those who walk in the desert</b> are required to thank God? The Gemara answers: <br><b>As it is written</b> in the same psalm: <br><b>“They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city in which to dwell”</b> (Psalms 107:4),<br><b>“And then they cried unto the Lord</b> in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. <br><b>And He led them forth by the right way”</b> (Psalms 107:6–7).<br>After God guides them on the right way, it is said: <b>“They are grateful to God for His goodness”</b> (Psalms 107:8). |
| Psalms 107:8 | “They are grateful to God for His goodness” | Berakhot 54b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>those who walk in the desert</b> are required to thank God? The Gemara answers: <br><b>As it is written</b> in the same psalm: <br><b>“They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city in which to dwell”</b> (Psalms 107:4),<br><b>“And then they cried unto the Lord</b> in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. <br><b>And He led them forth by the right way”</b> (Psalms 107:6–7).<br>After God guides them on the right way, it is said: <b>“They are grateful to God for His goodness”</b> (Psalms 107:8). |

| Psalms 107:32 | “Let them exalt Him also in the congregation of the people | Berakhot 54b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing</b> does he <b>recite?

| Psalms 109:22 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me” | Berakhot 61b:2 | With regard to one’s inclinations, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart. The <b>evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes”</b> (Psalms 36:2). <b>Middling people are ruled by both</b> the good and evil inclinations, <b>as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul”</b> (Psalms 109:31). |
| Psalms 109:31 | as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul” | Berakhot 61b:2 | With regard to one’s inclinations, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart.

| Psalms 111:10 | as it is stated: “The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord, a good understanding have all who fulfill them” | Berakhot 17a:11 | <b>Rava was wont to say:</b> <br><b>The objective of</b> Torah <b>wisdom</b> is to achieve <b>repentance and good deeds;</b> <br><b>that one should not read</b> the Torah <b>and study</b> mishna and become arrogant <br><b>and spurn his father and his mother and his teacher</b> <br><b>and one who is greater than he in wisdom or in</b> the <b>number</b> of students who study before him, <br><b>as it is stated: “The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord, a good understanding have all who fulfill them”</b> (Psalms 111:10). <br><b>It is not stated</b> simply: <b>All who fulfill, but rather: All who fulfill them,</b> those who perform these actions as they ought to be performed, meaning <b>those who do</b> such deeds <b>for their own sake,</b> for the sake of the deeds themselves, <b>not those who do them not for their own sake.</b> <br>Rava continued: <b>One who does them not for their own sake,</b> it would have been <b>preferable for him had he not been created.</b> |
| Psalms 112:1 | it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord, | Berakhot 8a:21 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord,</b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Gemara explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him.</b> |
| Psalms 112:7 | from my house. And of him, the verse says: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord” | Berakhot 60a:16 | <b>The Sages taught: There was an incident involving Hillel the Elder, who was coming on the road when he heard a scream in the city. He said: I am certain that</b> the scream <b>is not</b> coming <b>from my house. And of him, the verse says: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord”</b> (Psalms 112:7). <b>Rava said: Any way that you interpret this verse,</b> its meaning is clear. <b>It</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end</b> or <b>it</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end: Why is it that: He shall not be afraid of evil tidings?</b> Because <b>his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>And it</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning:</b> One whose <b>heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord</b> is a person who <b>shall not be afraid of evil tidings.</b> |
| Psalms 115:16 | “The heavens are the Lord’s and the earth He has given over to mankind” | Berakhot 35a:21 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s,</b> the world and all those who live in it” (Psalms 24:1). Rabbi Levi expressed this concept differently. <b>Rabbi Levi raised a contradiction: It is written: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s,” and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The heavens are the Lord’s and the earth He has given over to mankind”</b> (Psalms 115:16). There is clearly a contradiction with regard to whom the earth belongs. He himself resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the verse that says that the earth is the Lord’s refers to the situation <b>before a blessing</b> is recited, |
| Psalms 116:13 | “I will lift the cup of salvation and upon the name of the Lord I will call” | Berakhot 51b:2 | <b>And he lifts it</b> at least <b>one handbreadth from the ground. Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is the verse</b> that proves this? <b>“I will lift the cup of salvation and upon the name of the Lord I will call”</b> (Psalms 116:13). |
| Psalms 116:13 | “I will lift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord” | Berakhot 60b:10 | <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said:</b> The proof is <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“I will lift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 116:13), and: <b>“I found trouble and sorrow, but I called upon the name of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 116:3–4). |
| Psalms 119:28 | be inferred that nugei is an expression of sorrow? As it is written: “My soul drips in sorrow [ tuga ]” | Berakhot 28a:19 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Regarding anyone who recites the morning prayer after four hours</b> of the day, <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are in sorrow [<i>nugei</i>] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you,</b> they who carried for you the burden of insult” (Zephaniah 3:18). <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that <i>nugei</i> is an expression of sorrow? As it is written: “My soul drips in sorrow [<i>tuga</i>]”</b> (Psalms 119:28). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The proof that <i>nugei</i> indicates suffering is <b>from here: “Her virgins are sorrowed [<i>nugot</i>] and she is embittered”</b> (Lamentations 1:4). |
| Psalms 119:46 | “And I speak Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed” | Berakhot 4a:10 | <b>Rav Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“And I speak Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed”</b> (Psalms 119:46). This verse alludes both to David’s commitment to Torah, in contrast to the kings of the East and the West, as well as to the fact that he was not ashamed to discuss matters of Torah with Mefivoshet, a descendant of kings. David was not afraid to have his mistakes corrected by Mefivoshet. |
| Psalms 119:62 | One verse says: “At midnight I rise to give thanks for Your righteous laws” | Berakhot 3b:14 | <b>What is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>reasoning? Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion is based on a comparison of two verses. <b>One verse says: “At midnight I rise to give thanks for Your righteous laws”</b> (Psalms 119:62), <b>and the other verse says: “My eyes forestall the watches,</b> that I will speak of Your word” (Psalms 119:148). Taken together, these verses indicate that their author, King David, rose at midnight, two watches before dawn, in order to study Torah. <b>How is it</b> possible to reconcile these two verses? Only if <b>there are four watches in the night</b> does one who rises two watches before dawn rise at midnight. |
| Psalms 119:62 | “At midnight I rise to give thanks” | Berakhot 4a:8 | The Gemara further explores King David’s character. It is said: “A prayer <b>of David…Keep my soul, for I am pious”</b> (Psalms 86:1–2). Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak debated the meaning of this verse and how David’s piety is manifest in the fact that he went beyond his fundamental obligations. <b>One said:</b> David’s declaration of piety referred to his awakening during the night to pray, and <b>so said David before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, am I not pious? As all of the kings of the East and the West sleep until the third hour</b> of the day, <b>but</b> although I am a king like them, <b>“At midnight I rise to give thanks”</b> (Psalms 119:62). |
| Psalms 119:126 | it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah” | Berakhot 54a:9 | The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah. |
| Psalms 119:126 | states: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah” | Berakhot 63a:8 | <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). Of this, <b>Rava said: This verse</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end, and</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning.</b> |
| Psalms 119:147 | Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the neshef and cried, | Berakhot 3b:20 | Incidental to the Gemara’s mention of King David, other sources are cited that describe his actions. Regarding that which was cited above, that he would rise in the middle of the night in order to serve his Creator, the Gemara asks: <b>Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the <i>neshef</i> and cried,</b> I hoped for Your word” (Psalms 119:147). <b>And how</b> do we know <b>that this <i>neshef</i> is the evening? As it is written: “In the <i>neshef</i>, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness”</b> (Proverbs 7:9). Apparently, King David did indeed rise when it was still evening. |
| Psalms 119:148 | and the other verse says: “My eyes forestall the watches, | Berakhot 3b:14 | <b>What is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>reasoning?

| Psalms 119:165 | “Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them” | Berakhot 64a:14 | The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>].</b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you. For the sake of the House of the Lord, our God, I will seek your good”</b> (Psalms 122:8–9), and <b>“May the Lord give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 122:7 | “May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces” | Berakhot 64a:14 | The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>].</b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you.

| Psalms 125:1 | inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David. They who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion, | Berakhot 58b:4 | Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: You have nothing about which to sigh, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said the Lord of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant”</b> (Isaiah 5:9). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the <b>future,</b> in the end of days, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore them to their</b> original locations and their <b>inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David. They who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion,</b> which cannot be moved but abides forever” (Psalms 125:1). From this verse one may infer that <b>just as in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore Mount Zion to its inhabited state, so too, in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore the houses of the righteous to their inhabited state,</b> so you have no reason to sigh. <b>Seeing that he was still not satisfied,</b> Ulla <b>said to him: It is enough for a servant to be like his master.</b> Since God leaves His home, the Holy Temple, in ruins, one should not be distraught over the destruction of the houses of the righteous. |
| Psalms 125:5 | fall in Gehenna, as it is stated: “But those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity; peace be upon Israel” | Berakhot 19a:5 | Rabbi Yehoshua <b>ben Levi said</b> similarly: <b>One who speaks</b> disparagingly <b>after the biers of Torah scholars</b> and maligns them after their death will <b>fall in Gehenna, as it is stated: “But those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity; peace be upon Israel”</b> (Psalms 125:5). <b>Even</b> if he speaks ill of them <b>when there is peace upon Israel,</b> after death, when they are no longer able to fight those denouncing them (<i>Tosafot</i>); nevertheless <b>the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity,</b> to Gehenna. |
| Psalms 126:1 | as it is stated: | Berakhot 31a:4 | In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is forbidden to fill his mouth with mirth in this world,</b> as long as we are in exile (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>as it is stated:</b> “When the Lord returns the captivity of Zion we will be as dreamers” (Psalms 126:1). Only <b>“then will our mouths fill with laughter and our lips with song”</b> (Psalms 126:2). <b>When</b> will that joyous era arrive? When <b>“they will say among nations, the Lord has done great things with these”</b> (Psalms 126:2). <b>They said about Reish Lakish that throughout his life he did not fill his mouth with laughter in this world once he heard this</b> statement <b>from his teacher, Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> |
| Psalms 126:2 | “then will our mouths fill with laughter and our lips with song” | Berakhot 31a:4 | In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is forbidden to fill his mouth with mirth in this world,</b> as long as we are in exile (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>as it is stated:</b> “When the Lord returns the captivity of Zion we will be as dreamers” (Psalms 126:1).

| Psalms 128:2 | while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you” | Berakhot 8a:21 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord,</b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Gemara explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him.</b> |
| Psalms 128:3 | his wife will not miscarry, as it is stated: “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine, | Berakhot 57a:6 | <b>One who sees a vine laden</b> with grapes <b>in a dream,</b> it is an omen that <b>his wife will not miscarry, as it is stated: “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine,</b> in the innermost parts of your house” (Psalms 128:3). One who sees <b>a</b> planted <b>vine branch</b> in a dream <b>should anticipate the Messiah, as it is stated: “Binding his foal unto the vine and his donkey’s colt unto the vine branch”</b> (Genesis 49:11). |
| Psalms 128:3 | he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants, | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream,</b> and they were <b>small,</b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but,</b> one who sees olive <b>trees,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants,</b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Gemara likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Psalms 130:1 | in a low place and pray, as it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths” | Berakhot 10b:26 | With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of prayer, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: A person should not stand in a high place and pray; rather,</b> he should stand <b>in a low place and pray, as it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths”</b> (Psalms 130:1). |
| Psalms 134:2 | “Lift your hands in holiness and bless the Lord” | Berakhot 51a:21 | With regard to what was said that <b>he takes it in his two hands, Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa said: What is the verse</b> that proves this? As it is stated: <b>“Lift your hands in holiness and bless the Lord”</b> (Psalms 134:2). |
| Psalms 135:7 | written: “He makes lightning for the rain” | Berakhot 59a:13 | We learned in the mishna that <b>over mountains and hills</b> one recites: Blessed…Author of creation. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all those that we mentioned until now,</b> such as lightning, <b>are not acts of creation?</b> Among God’s praise for creation of the world and forming the mountains, <b>is it not</b> also <b>written: “He makes lightning for the rain”</b> (Psalms 135:7)? <b>Abaye said: Combine</b> the two statements and <b>teach that</b> in all the cases in our mishna, one recites these two blessings. <b>Rava said: There,</b> over lightning and thunder, <b>one recites two</b> blessings: <b>Blessed…Whose power fills the world, and: Author of creation. Here,</b> however, over mountains and hills, <b>one</b> recites the blessing: <b>Author of creation,</b> but <b>need not</b> recite: <b>Whose power fills the world.</b> |
| Psalms 136:25 | “Who provides food to all flesh, | Berakhot 4b:19 | <b>Rather,</b> if you suggest that this particular chapter is recited <b>because it contains</b> praise for God’s provision of sustenance to all of creation: <b>“You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16), then <b>let him recite the great <i>hallel</i></b> (Psalms 136), <b>in which</b> numerous praises are <b>written,</b> including: <b>“Who provides food to all flesh,</b> Whose kindness endures forever” (Psalms 136:25). |
| Psalms 139:5 | as it is stated: “You have formed me [ tzartani ] behind and before” | Berakhot 61a:5 | <b>Alternatively,</b> this duplication in the language of creation can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, as Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, created two faces [<i>du partzufin</i>] on Adam the first</b> man; he was created both male and female in a single body, <b>as it is stated: “You have formed me [<i>tzartani</i>] behind and before”</b> (Psalms 139:5); <i>tzartani</i> is derived from the word <i>tzura</i> [face]. God formed two faces on a single creation, back and front. |
| Psalms 140:14 | wait one hour after his prayer, as it is stated: “Surely the righteous will give thanks unto Your name, the upright will sit before You” | Berakhot 32b:22 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who prays must</b> also <b>wait one hour after his prayer, as it is stated: “Surely the righteous will give thanks unto Your name, the upright will sit before You”</b> (Psalms 140:14), meaning that after thanking God through prayer, one should stay and sit before Him. |
| Psalms 141:2 | with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering” | Berakhot 6b:28 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering”</b> (Psalms 141:2). <br><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward”</b> (Psalms 5:4). |
| Psalms 144:14 | “Our leaders are laden, | Berakhot 17a:16 | <b>When the Sages took leave of the study hall of Rav Ḥisda, and some say</b> it was <b>the study hall of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, they would say to him the following,</b> in accordance with the verse: <b>“Our leaders are laden,</b> there is no breach and no going forth and no outcry in our open places” (Psalms 144:14). |
| Psalms 145:9 | “His mercy is over all His creations” | Berakhot 7a:19 | The Gemara relates: <b>A certain heretic who was in Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s neighborhood would upset him</b> by incessantly challenging the legitimacy of <b>verses. One day,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>took a rooster and placed it between the legs of the bed</b> upon which he sat <b>and looked at it. He thought: When the moment</b> of God’s anger <b>arrives, I will curse him</b> and be rid of him. <b>When the moment</b> of God’s anger <b>arrived,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>slept.</b> When he woke up, <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>Conclude from</b> the fact that I nodded off <b>that it is not proper conduct to do so,</b> to curse people, even if they are wicked. <b>“His mercy is over all His creations”</b> (Psalms 145:9) <b>is written</b> even with regard to sinners. |
| Psalms 145:14 | “The Lord upholds the fallen | Berakhot 4b:22 | In order to ease the harsh meaning of this verse, <b>in the West,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they interpreted it</b> with a slight adjustment: <b>“She has fallen but she shall fall no more; rise, virgin of Israel.” Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> adds: <b>Even so, David went and</b> provided <b>support, through divine inspiration.</b> Although King David did not include a verse beginning with the letter <i>nun</i> alluding to Israel’s downfall, he foresaw the verse that would be written by Amos through divine inspiration; and the very next verse, which begins with the letter <i>samekh</i>, reads: <b>“The Lord upholds the fallen</b> and raises up those who are bowed down” (Psalms 145:14). Therefore, through divine inspiration, David offered hope and encouragement; although the virgin of Israel may have fallen, the Lord upholds the fallen. |
| Psalms 145:16 | “You open Your hand | Berakhot 4b:19 | <b>Rather,</b> if you suggest that this particular chapter is recited <b>because it contains</b> praise for God’s provision of sustenance to all of creation: <b>“You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16), then <b>let him recite the great <i>hallel</i></b> (Psalms 136), <b>in which</b> numerous praises are <b>written,</b> including: <b>“Who provides food to all flesh,</b> Whose kindness endures forever” (Psalms 136:25). |
| Psalms 146:8 | As it is written: “The Lord, who raises the bowed” | Berakhot 12a:25 | <b>Shmuel,</b> who was Rav’s colleague and significantly outlived him, <b>said: What is Rav’s reason</b> for saying that one should stand upright at the mention of God’s name? <b>As it is written: “The Lord, who raises the bowed”</b> (Psalms 146:8); one stands upright at the mention of God’s name to recall that it is God who raises the bowed. |
| Psalms 147:2 | he opened with: Have compassion on Jerusalem, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem. Rav Naḥman said: Even if he opened with: Have compassion on Israel, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem, because it is stated: “The Lord builds Jerusalem; He gathers in the exiles of Israel” | Berakhot 49a:14 | <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> If <b>he opened with: Have compassion on Your people, Israel,</b> mentioning redemption of Israel at the start, <b>he concludes with: Who redeems Israel;</b> if <b>he opened with: Have compassion on Jerusalem, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem. Rav Naḥman said: Even if he opened with: Have compassion on Israel, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem, because it is stated: “The Lord builds Jerusalem; He gathers in the exiles of Israel”</b> (Psalms 147:2). This verse is interpreted to mean: <b>When does God build Jerusalem? When He gathers in the exiles of Israel.</b> The rebuilding of Jerusalem symbolizes Israel’s redemption. |
| Psalms 147:14 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One who sees wheat in a dream has seen peace, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you in plenty the fat of wheat” | Berakhot 57a:5 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One who sees wheat in a dream has seen peace, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you in plenty the fat of wheat”</b> (Psalms 147:14). And <b>one who sees barley [<i>se’orim</i>] in a dream</b> has received a sign that <b>his iniquities are taken away, as it is stated: “And your iniquity is taken away [<i>vesar avonekh</i>], and your sin expiated”</b> (Isaiah 6:7); <i>se’orim</i> is an acronym for <i>sar avon</i>. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: I did not ascend from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael until I saw barley in my dream.</b> |
| Psalms 149:6 | as it is stated: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands” | Berakhot 5a:4 | The Gemara continues its treatment of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> upon one’s bed. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> on his bed, it is as if he holds a double-edged sword,</b> guarding him from all evil, <b>as it is stated: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands”</b> (Psalms 149:6). The Gemara asks: <b>From where is it inferred</b> that this verse from Psalms refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>? <b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said:</b> We derive it <b>from the preceding</b> verse, <b>as it is written: “Let the pious exult in glory; let them joyously sing upon their beds.”</b> The praise of God from one’s bed is the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>And it is written thereafter: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands.”</b> |
| Psalms 150:6 | praise the Lord; Halleluya” | Berakhot 25a:3 | <b>It was stated</b> that the Sages disagreed with regard to one who had <b>fecal matter on his skin or</b> whose <b>hand,</b> but not the rest of his body, <b>was placed inside the bathroom.</b> Under those circumstances, <b>Rav Huna said:</b> He is <b>permitted to recite <i>Shema</i>. Rav Ḥisda said: He is prohibited from reciting <i>Shema</i>. Rava said: What is the reason for Rav Huna’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “Let every soul</b> [<b><i>neshama</i></b>] <b>praise the Lord; Halleluya”</b> (Psalms 150:6), which he interprets as “Let everything that has breath” [<i>neshima</i>]. As long as the mouth with which one recites praise is in a place of purity, the location of the other limbs of his body is irrelevant. |
| Psalms 150:6 | that one recites a blessing over scent? As it is stated: “Let every soul praise the Lord” | Berakhot 43b:3 | On a related topic, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who goes out during Nisan and sees trees that are blossoming recites: Blessed…who has withheld nothing from His world, and has created in it beautiful creatures and trees for human beings to enjoy. Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one recites a blessing over scent? As it is stated: “Let every soul praise the Lord”</b> (Psalms 150:6). He explains the verse: <b>What is it from which the soul derives benefit and the body does not derive benefit from it? You must say: That is scent.</b> Even over items from which only the soul derives benefit, one must recite a blessing and praise God. |
| Proverbs 1:8 | his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother” | Berakhot 35b:2 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel. |
| Proverbs 1:20 | One who sees a goose in a dream should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Wisdoms cry aloud in the streets, | Berakhot 57a:10 | <b>One who sees a goose in a dream should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Wisdoms cry aloud in the streets,</b> she utters her voice in the broad places” (Proverbs 1:20); geese tend to sound their voices. One who dreams that <b>he has relations with</b> the goose <b>will become head of the yeshiva. Rav Ashi said: I saw</b> a goose and <b>had relations with it</b> in my dream <b>and I ascended to greatness</b> and became head of the yeshiva. |
| Proverbs 2:3 | understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [ im ] you call for understanding” | Berakhot 57a:4 | <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with his mother [<i>em</i>] in a dream, he should anticipate</b> attaining <b>understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [<i>im</i>] you call for understanding”</b> (Proverbs 2:3), and in this homiletic interpretation <i>im</i> is considered to be the equivalent of <i>em</i>. <b>One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with a betrothed young woman</b> in a dream, <b>he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [<i>morasha</i>] of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>morasha</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>me’orasa</i>, betrothed. One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with a married woman in a dream is assured that he is one</b> who has a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> He receives his place as well as that of another person in the Garden of Eden, as the married woman represents a portion belonging to someone else. However, the Gemara adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where <b>he did not know her and was not thinking about her that evening;</b> rather, he saw an unidentified woman in his dream by chance. |
| Proverbs 3:6 | Torah are dependent? “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths” | Berakhot 63a:13 | <b>Bar Kappara taught: Which is a brief passage upon which all fundamental</b> principles of <b>Torah are dependent? “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths”</b> (Proverbs 3:6). <b>Rava said:</b> One must apply this principle <b>even to acts of transgression,</b> as even then one must adhere to God and refrain from sinning excessively. |
| Proverbs 3:12 | he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, | Berakhot 5a:10 | <b>And if he did attribute</b> his suffering to dereliction in the study of Torah, <b>and did not find</b> this to be so, <b>he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes,</b> as does a father the son in whom he delights” (Proverbs 3:12). |
| Proverbs 3:17 | The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah | Berakhot 8a:4 | <b>That</b> last proof <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not despise the prayer of the masses? As it is stated: “Behold, God does not despise the mighty,” and it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me;</b> for there were many with me.” Rabbi Natan interprets this not as David speaking about himself, but as God speaking to Israel. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, which is called peace in the verse: “All its ways are peace” (Proverbs 3:17); <b>and in acts of kindness, and prays with the congregation, I ascribe to him</b> credit <b>as if he redeemed Me and My children from among the nations of the world.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:18 | and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it, | Berakhot 32b:9 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it to be answered, will ultimately come to heartache,</b> as it will not be answered. <b>As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). <b>And what is the remedy</b> for one afflicted with that illness? He should <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “But desire fulfilled is the tree of life”</b> (Proverbs 13:12), <b>and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it,</b> and those who support it are joyous” (Proverbs 3:18). This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement that one will suffer heartache refers to one <b>who prolongs</b> his prayer <b>and expects it to be answered; that,</b> Rabbi Ḥanin’s statement that one who prolongs his prayer is praiseworthy refers to <b>one who prolongs his prayer and</b> does <b>not expect it to be answered.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:19 | “The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens” | Berakhot 55a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Bezalel knew</b> how <b>to join</b> the <b>letters with which heaven and earth were created.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here</b> in praise of Bezalel: <b>“And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</b> and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to creation of heaven and earth: <b>“The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens”</b> (Proverbs 3:19), <b>and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up</b> and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20). We see that wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, the qualities with which the heavens and earth were created, are all found in Bezalel. |
| Proverbs 3:20 | and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up | Berakhot 55a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Bezalel knew</b> how <b>to join</b> the <b>letters with which heaven and earth were created.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here</b> in praise of Bezalel: <b>“And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</b> and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to creation of heaven and earth: <b>“The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens”</b> (Proverbs 3:19), <b>and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up</b> and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20).

| Proverbs 4:2 | Tova , that is Torah, as it says: “For I have given you good [ tov ] teachings, | Berakhot 48b:12 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> Proof for a blessing over the Torah from a different verse <b>is not necessary, as it says:</b> “For the good [<i>hatova</i>] land.” Two different matters are derived from different aspects of the word <i>hatova</i>: <b><i>Tova</i>, that is Torah, as it says: “For I have given you good [<i>tov</i>] teachings,</b> do not forsake My Torah” (Proverbs 4:2); <b><i>hatova</i>, that is the building of Jerusalem, as it says: “This good mountain [<i>hatov</i>] and Lebanon.”</b> |
| Proverbs 4:2 | nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it” | Berakhot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren,</b> who learn only the Written Torah, <b>know this</b> concept <b>as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>Rather,</b> one must interpret the verse: <b>Anyone who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>yet does not engage</b> in that study, not only does <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> fail to protect him, but He <b>brings upon him hideous afflictions,</b> that embarrass him <b>and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong”</b> (Psalms 39:3). The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong.” |
| Proverbs 4:7 | The Sages teach: One who sees a reed [ kaneh ] in a dream should expect wisdom, as it is stated: “Get [ kene ] wisdom” | Berakhot 56b:14 | <b>The Sages teach: One who sees a reed [<i>kaneh</i>] in a dream should expect wisdom, as it is stated: “Get [<i>kene</i>] wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). One who sees several <b>reeds [<i>kanim</i>] should expect understanding, as it said: “Yea, with all your acquisitions [<i>kinyanekha</i>] acquire understanding”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Pumpkin [<i>kara</i>], heart of palm [<i>kura</i>], wax [<i>kira</i>], and reed [<i>kanya</i>], are all advantageous when one dreams</b> about them. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A pumpkin is only shown</b> in a dream <b>to one who fears Heaven with all his might,</b> because pumpkins <b>[<i>delu’im</i>]</b> are interpreted as an acronym for <i>dalu einai lamarom</i>, “My eyes were raised on high” (Isaiah 38:14). |
| Proverbs 4:8 | not you who honors me; rather, the Torah honors me, as it is written: “Extol her and she will exalt you; she will bring you to honor when you embrace her” | Berakhot 48a:5 | The Gemara relates: <b>King Yannai and the queen ate bread together.

| Proverbs 6:23 | The World-to-Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life” | Berakhot 5a:23 | <b>The World-to-Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). One may arrive at the lamp of mitzva and the light of Torah that exists in the World-to-Come only by means of the reproofs of instruction in this world. |
| Proverbs 7:4 | had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister” | Berakhot 57a:4 | <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with his mother [<i>em</i>] in a dream, he should anticipate</b> attaining <b>understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [<i>im</i>] you call for understanding”</b> (Proverbs 2:3), and in this homiletic interpretation <i>im</i> is considered to be the equivalent of <i>em</i>. <b>One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with a betrothed young woman</b> in a dream, <b>he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [<i>morasha</i>] of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>morasha</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>me’orasa</i>, betrothed. One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with a married woman in a dream is assured that he is one</b> who has a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> He receives his place as well as that of another person in the Garden of Eden, as the married woman represents a portion belonging to someone else. However, the Gemara adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where <b>he did not know her and was not thinking about her that evening;</b> rather, he saw an unidentified woman in his dream by chance. |
| Proverbs 7:9 | that this neshef is the evening? As it is written: “In the neshef , in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness” | Berakhot 3b:20 | Incidental to the Gemara’s mention of King David, other sources are cited that describe his actions. Regarding that which was cited above, that he would rise in the middle of the night in order to serve his Creator, the Gemara asks: <b>Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the <i>neshef</i> and cried,</b> I hoped for Your word” (Psalms 119:147). <b>And how</b> do we know <b>that this <i>neshef</i> is the evening? As it is written: “In the <i>neshef</i>, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness”</b> (Proverbs 7:9). Apparently, King David did indeed rise when it was still evening. |
| Proverbs 8:34 | “Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts” | Berakhot 8a:7 | <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based? As it is stated: <b>“Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts”</b> (Proverbs 8:34). <b>And</b> the reward for doing so <b>is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). |
| Proverbs 8:35 | “For whoever finds me finds life” | Berakhot 56b:7 | The Gemara continues dealing with interpretations of the details of dreams: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water”</b> (Genesis 26:19), and ultimately there was peace. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One who sees a well in his dream it is a symbol that <b>he has found Torah,</b> as the well symbolizes Torah. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“For whoever finds me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35), <b>and it is written here: “A well of living water,”</b> and we see that a well is linked to Torah as both are associated with life. <b>Rava said:</b> The well in the dream symbolizes <b>actual life.</b> |
| Proverbs 8:35 | is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord” | Berakhot 8a:7 | <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based? As it is stated: <b>“Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts”</b> (Proverbs 8:34). <b>And</b> the reward for doing so <b>is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). |
| Proverbs 9:5 | as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled” | Berakhot 57a:22 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the <i>tanna:</i></b> You should <b>teach</b> that for <b>a Torah scholar,</b> a dream of wine is <b>always</b> a <b>good</b> omen, <b>as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled”</b> (Proverbs 9:5). |
| Proverbs 11:21 | The Sages taught: One who counts money for a woman from his hand to her hand in order to look upon her, even if he has accumulated Torah and good deeds like Moses our teacher, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not go unpunished” | Berakhot 61a:21 | <b>The Sages taught: One who counts money for a woman from his hand to her hand in order to look upon her, even if he has accumulated Torah and good deeds like Moses our teacher, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not go unpunished”</b> (Proverbs 11:21); one who hands money from his hand to her hand, even if he received the Torah from God’s hand to his own, like Moses, <b>he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna,</b> which is called evil. |
| Proverbs 11:24 | And if you see a generation for whom Torah is beloved, disseminate, as it is stated: “There is who scatters, and yet increases” | Berakhot 63a:10 | With regard to this verse, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Hillel the Elder says: At the time of gathering,</b> if the Sages of the generation see to it that the Torah remains the purview of the few, <b>disseminate</b> it to the public at large. <b>At the time of dissemination, gather,</b> and leave it to others to disseminate the Torah. <b>And if you see a generation for whom Torah is beloved, disseminate, as it is stated: “There is who scatters, and yet increases”</b> (Proverbs 11:24). However, <b>if you see a generation for whom Torah is not beloved, gather;</b> do not cause the Torah to be disgraced, <b>as it is stated: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah.”</b> Preventing Torah study in that situation is a manifestation of work for the Lord. |
| Proverbs 12:21 | and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous” | Berakhot 7b:21 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that this,</b> which says not to confront <b>and that,</b> which says to confront, are both referring <b>to a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling,</b> but the question of whether one is permitted to confront him depends on who is confronting him. <b>And</b> nevertheless, this is <b>not difficult. This,</b> which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring <b>to a completely righteous person, while this,</b> which says that one may not confront the wicked, is referring <b>to one who is not completely righteous, as Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Why do You look on those who deal treacherously and hold Your peace? When the wicked swallows the man more righteous than he?”</b> (Habakkuk 1:13). This verse is difficult to understand. <b>Do the wicked swallow the righteous? Isn’t it written:</b> “The wicked looks to the righteous and seeks to kill him; <b>the Lord will not leave him in his hand,</b> nor allow him to be condemned when he is judged” (Psalms 37:32–33), <b>and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21)? <b>Rather,</b> in light of these verses, the verse: “The wicked swallows the man more righteous than he” means: <b>The</b> man who is <b>more righteous than he,</b> but not completely righteous, <b>he swallows. The completely righteous he does not swallow.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:12 | As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick” | Berakhot 32b:9 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it to be answered, will ultimately come to heartache,</b> as it will not be answered. <b>As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). <b>And what is the remedy</b> for one afflicted with that illness? He should <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “But desire fulfilled is the tree of life”</b> (Proverbs 13:12), <b>and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it,</b> and those who support it are joyous” (Proverbs 3:18). This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement that one will suffer heartache refers to one <b>who prolongs</b> his prayer <b>and expects it to be answered; that,</b> Rabbi Ḥanin’s statement that one who prolongs his prayer is praiseworthy refers to <b>one who prolongs his prayer and</b> does <b>not expect it to be answered.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:12 | will ultimately come to heartache, as it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick” | Berakhot 55a:1 | <b>Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it</b> to be answered, <b>will ultimately come to heartache, as it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Three matters evoke a person’s sins, and they are:</b> Endangering oneself by sitting or standing next to an <b>inclined wall</b> that is about to collapse, <b>expecting prayer</b> to be accepted, as that leads to an assessment of his status and merit, <b>and passing a case against another to Heaven,</b> as praying for Heaven to pass judgment on another person causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of that other person. This proves that prolonging prayer is a fault. |
| Proverbs 14:23 | Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira. He saw that Rabbi Yirmeya was excessively joyful. He said to him: It is written: “In all sorrow there is profit” | Berakhot 30b:23 | Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira. He saw that Rabbi Yirmeya was excessively joyful. He said to him: It is written: “In all sorrow there is profit”</b> (Proverbs 14:23); sorrow is appropriate, not excessive joy. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | as it is stated: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people” | Berakhot 53a:23 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>People were seated in the study hall and they brought fire before them</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say: Each and every individual recites a blessing for himself; and Beit Hillel say: One recites a blessing on behalf of everyone</b> and the others answer amen. Beit Hillel’s reasoning is <b>as it is stated: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). When everyone joins together to hear the blessing, the name of God is glorified. |
| Proverbs 14:31 | but he who is gracious to the poor honors Him” | Berakhot 18a:12 | <b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who sees the deceased</b> taken to burial <b>and does not escort him has committed a transgression due to</b> the verse: <b>“He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator.” (Proverbs 17:5) And if he does escort him, what is his reward? Rav Asi said: The verse says about him: “He who gives to the poor gives a loan to the Lord,</b> and the Lord will repay him” (Proverbs 19:17), and: “He who oppresses the poor blasphemes his Creator, <b>but he who is gracious to the poor honors Him”</b> (Proverbs 14:31). |
| Proverbs 15:1 | “A soft answer turns away wrath” | Berakhot 17a:9 | <b>Abaye was wont to say:</b> <b>One must always be shrewd</b> and utilize every strategy <b>in</b> order to achieve <b>fear</b> of Heaven and performance of mitzvot. One must fulfill the verse: <b>“A soft answer turns away wrath”</b> (Proverbs 15:1) and take steps to <b>increase peace with one’s brethren and with one’s relatives,</b> <b>and with all people, even with a non-Jew in the marketplace,</b> despite the fact that he is of no importance to him and does not know him at all (<i>Me’iri</i>), <b>so that he will be loved above</b> in God’s eyes, <b>pleasant below</b> in the eyes of the people, <b>and acceptable to all</b> of God’s <b>creatures.</b> |
| Proverbs 15:25 | the houses of the nations of the world inhabited recites: “The Lord will destroy the house of the proud, | Berakhot 58b:1 | <b>The Sages taught: One who sees the houses of Israel inhabited</b> and tranquil <b>recites: Blessed…Who establishes the border of the widow.</b> One who sees them <b>in ruins he recites: Blessed…the true Judge.</b> One who sees <b>the houses of the nations of the world inhabited recites: “The Lord will destroy the house of the proud,</b> but He will establish the border of the widow” (Proverbs 15:25). <b>And</b> if he sees them <b>in ruins he recites: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance, shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1). |
| Proverbs 16:6 | as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated” | Berakhot 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> What is your source for this? <b>Granted,</b> if one engages in <b>Torah and acts of charity,</b> his transgressions are forgiven, <b>as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated”</b> (Proverbs 16:6); <b>mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), mercy and charity are listed together. <b>And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it;</b> also wisdom, guidance and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>However, from where is it derived</b> that the transgressions of <b>one who buries his sons</b> are also forgiven? |
| Proverbs 17:5 | “He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator” | Berakhot 18a:6 | The Gemara further challenges: We concluded that, in both cases, if it is <b>his deceased</b> relative or if he was <b>watching over</b> the unrelated deceased, <b>he is</b> exempt from mitzvot. <b>However, one walking in a cemetery is not</b> exempt. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head and a Torah scroll in his arm and read</b> from it? <b>If one does so he commits</b> a transgression <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator”</b> (Proverbs 17:5). As the deceased is incapable of fulfilling mitzvot, fulfilling a mitzva in his presence is seen as mocking him. |
| Proverbs 17:10 | preferable to one hundred lashes, as it is stated: “A rebuke enters deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred lashes to a fool” | Berakhot 7a:22 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: A single regret</b> or pang of guilt <b>in one’s heart is preferable to many lashes</b> administered by others that cause only physical pain, <b>as it is stated: “And she chases her lovers,</b> but she does not overtake them; she seeks them, but she will not find them; <b>and she will say ‘I will go and return to my first husband; for it was better for me then than now’”</b> (Hosea 2:9). Remorse is more effective than any externally imposed punishment listed in the verses that follow (Hosea 2:11–19). <b>And Reish Lakish said</b> that in the Bible, it seems that such remorse is <b>preferable to one hundred lashes, as it is stated: “A rebuke enters deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred lashes to a fool”</b> (Proverbs 17:10). |
| Proverbs 17:26 | it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good” | Berakhot 7a:20 | Moreover, it is inappropriate to cause the punishment of another, as <b>it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good”</b> (Proverbs 17:26), even for a righteous person, it is improper to punish another. |
| Proverbs 18:22 | As it is said: “He who finds [ matza ] a wife finds [ matza ] good | Berakhot 8a:9 | Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Gemara seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding,</b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife,</b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22). |
| Proverbs 18:24 | as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own hurt” | Berakhot 63a:15 | Several ethical tenets and guidelines for life <b>were taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One should never have too many friends in his house,</b> i.e., people should not become accustomed to being overly intimate in his house, <b>as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own hurt”</b> (Proverbs 18:24); one with friends of that kind will ultimately come to quarrel. |
| Proverbs 19:17 | “He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator.” (Proverbs 17:5) And if he does escort him, what is his reward? Rav Asi said: The verse says about him: “He who gives to the poor gives a loan to the Lord, | Berakhot 18a:12 | <b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who sees the deceased</b> taken to burial <b>and does not escort him has committed a transgression due to</b> the verse: <b>“He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator.” (Proverbs 17:5) And if he does escort him, what is his reward? Rav Asi said: The verse says about him: “He who gives to the poor gives a loan to the Lord,</b> and the Lord will repay him” (Proverbs 19:17), and: “He who oppresses the poor blasphemes his Creator, <b>but he who is gracious to the poor honors Him”</b> (Proverbs 14:31). |
| Proverbs 19:23 | Rabbi Zeira said: One who goes seven nights without a dream, is called evil, as it is stated: “He who has it will abide satisfied [ save’a ], he will not be visited by evil” | Berakhot 14a:18 | Having mentioned his name, the Gemara tangentially cites what <b>Rabbi Yona said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: One who goes seven nights without a dream, is called evil, as it is stated: “He who has it will abide satisfied [<i>save’a</i>], he will not be visited by evil”</b> (Proverbs 19:23). Rabbi Yona reinterprets the verse: <b>Do not read <i>save’a</i>, satisfied, but <i>sheva</i>, seven.</b> One who sleeps for seven nights without being visited by a dream, is called evil. |
| Proverbs 19:23 | as it is stated: “And he that has it shall lie satisfied [ vesave’a ], he shall not be visited with evil” | Berakhot 55b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And when he does not see</b> a dream, <b>is</b> that <b>a virtue? Didn’t Rabbi Zeira say: Anyone who sleeps seven days without a dream is called evil,</b> as it indicates that God does not wish to appear to him even in that indirect manner. Allusion to this is, <b>as it is stated: “And he that has it shall lie satisfied [<i>vesave’a</i>], he shall not be visited with evil”</b> (Proverbs 19:23). The Sages said: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>satisfied [<i>vesave’a</i>], rather</b> read it as <b>seven [<i>vesheva</i>],</b> which is an allusion to the fact that one who sleeps seven times and does not experience a dream is considered evil. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that David saw dreams <b>and the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>says as follows:</b> David certainly <b>saw</b> dreams, <b>but he did not understand what he saw.</b> |
| Proverbs 21:1 | A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses: | Berakhot 55a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: Three</b> matters <b>require</b> a plea for <b>mercy</b> to bring them about: <b>A good king, a good year, and a good dream.</b> These three, kings, years, and dreams, are all bestowed by God and one must pray that they should be positive and constructive. The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses:</b> He turns it whithersoever He will” (Proverbs 21:1). A <b>good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). And a <b>good dream, as it is written:</b> “O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore <b>You will recover me [<i>vataḥlimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). Due to their apparent etymological similarity, the word <i>taḥlimeni</i> is interpreted as deriving from the word <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Proverbs 21:21 | mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor” | Berakhot 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> What is your source for this? <b>Granted,</b> if one engages in <b>Torah and acts of charity,</b> his transgressions are forgiven, <b>as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated”</b> (Proverbs 16:6); <b>mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), mercy and charity are listed together. <b>And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it;</b> also wisdom, guidance and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>However, from where is it derived</b> that the transgressions of <b>one who buries his sons</b> are also forgiven? |
| Proverbs 21:27 | “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, | Berakhot 22b:17 | The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One who was praying and</b> later <b>found feces in the place</b> where he prayed, <b>Rabba said: Although he committed a transgression</b> in his failure to examine that venue to determine if it was worthy of prayer (<i>Tosafot</i>), <b>his prayer is a</b> valid <b>prayer</b> and he fulfilled his obligation. <b>Rava strongly objects to his</b> statement: <b>Isn’t</b> it stated: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination,</b> the more so as he offers it in depravity” (Proverbs 21:27), from which we derive that a mitzva performed inappropriately is no mitzva at all? Consequently, the fact that he did not pay proper attention invalidates his prayer. <b>Rather, Rava said: Because</b> this person <b>committed a transgression, although he prayed, his prayer is an abomination</b> and he must pray again. |
| Proverbs 21:30 | “There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord” | Berakhot 19b:2 | We learned that some who come to console the bereaved are exempt from <i>Shema</i> as a means of honoring the deceased. The Gemara expands the discussion to raise the general question: To what degree does preserving human dignity take precedence over mitzvot enumerated in the Torah? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who discovers diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>],</b> i.e., a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>in his garment, must remove them even in the</b> public <b>marketplace.</b> He may not wait until he reaches home. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? As it is stated: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30). From here, the general principle: <b>Anywhere that there is desecration of the Lord’s name, one does not show respect to the teacher,</b> is derived. |
| Proverbs 23:5 | as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone; | Berakhot 5a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> upon his bed, demons stay away from him.</b> This is alluded to, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But man is born into trouble, <b>and the sparks [<i>reshef</i> ] fly [<i>uf</i> ] upward”</b> (Job 5:7). The verse is explained: The word <b>fly [<i>uf</i> ]</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah,</b> as Torah is difficult to grasp and easy to lose, like something that floats away, <b>as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone;</b> for riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies into the heavens” (Proverbs 23:5). The word <b>“sparks”</b> means <b>nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [<i>reshef</i>] and bitter destruction [<i>ketev meriri</i>],</b> and the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of the dust” (Deuteronomy 32:24). Here we see <i>reshef</i> listed along with <i>ketev meriri</i>, both of which are understood by the Sages to be names of demons. |
| Proverbs 23:15 | “My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine” | Berakhot 4a:13 | <b>In his</b> book of <b>wisdom, Solomon said</b> about this wise son: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), as David enjoyed witnessing his son Kilav develop into a Torah luminary to the extent that Kilav was able to respond to Mefivoshet. <b>And</b> Solomon <b>says</b> about Kilav: <b>“Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11). |
| Proverbs 23:17 | And it says: “One shall not envy the unjust, but be in fear of the Lord all the day” | Berakhot 7b:17 | The Gemara cites proof from another verse. <b>And it says: “One shall not envy the unjust, but be in fear of the Lord all the day”</b> (Proverbs 23:17). In this context, to envy means to seek to emulate the unjust. |
| Proverbs 23:22 | And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old” | Berakhot 54a:9 | The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah. |
| Proverbs 23:22 | “And despise not your mother when she is old” | Berakhot 63a:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>And if you say: Boaz said this on his own,</b> and it proves nothing with regard to normative practice, <b>come and hear</b> a proof from the verse: <b>“The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it was an angel who said</b> this <b>to Gideon,</b> that perhaps this verse was the angel informing Gideon that the Lord is with him, but it is not the standard formula of a greeting, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the verse: <b>“And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22); the customs of the nation’s elders are an adequate source from which to derive <i>halakha</i>. |
| Proverbs 23:23 | And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it; | Berakhot 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> What is your source for this? <b>Granted,</b> if one engages in <b>Torah and acts of charity,</b> his transgressions are forgiven, <b>as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated”</b> (Proverbs 16:6); <b>mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), mercy and charity are listed together. <b>And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it;</b> also wisdom, guidance and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>However, from where is it derived</b> that the transgressions of <b>one who buries his sons</b> are also forgiven? |
| Proverbs 23:25 | About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice” | Berakhot 19a:11 | <b>What is</b> the source for the third case, <b>one who is arrogant vis-à-vis Heaven?</b> The mishna relates that Ḥoni HaMe’aggel, the circle-drawer, drew a circle and stood inside it, and said that he would not leave the circle until it rained, and he went so far as to make demands in terms of the manner in which he wanted the rain to fall. After it rained, <b>Shimon ben Shataḥ,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin, relayed to <b>Ḥoni HaMe’aggel:</b> Actually, <b>you should be ostracized</b> for what you said, <b>and if you were not Ḥoni, I would have decreed ostracism upon you, but what can I do? You nag God and He does your bidding, like a son who nags his father and</b> his father <b>does his bidding</b> without reprimand. After all, the rain fell as you requested. <b>About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 23:25). Apparently, one who is arrogant vis-à-vis Heaven would ordinarily merit excommunication. |
| Proverbs 24:10 | lack the strength to stand on a day of adversity, as it is stated: “If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed” | Berakhot 63a:22 | <b>Rabbi Tavi said in the name of Rabbi Yoshiya: Anyone who is lax in his</b> study of <b>matters of Torah will</b> ultimately <b>lack the strength to stand on a day of adversity, as it is stated: “If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed”</b> (Proverbs 24:10). <b>Rav Ami bar Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: And even</b> if he was lax in the performance of <b>a single</b> mitzva, <b>as it is stated: If you faint;</b> this applies <b>in any case,</b> even in the case of a single mitzva. |
| Proverbs 27:8 | “As a bird that wanders from her nest, | Berakhot 56b:9 | Since rivers, birds, and pots have ambiguous connotations, it is recommended that someone who sees them in a dream recite a verse that interprets the dream positively. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, <b>one who sees a river in a dream</b> should <b>rise early</b> and <b>recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For distress will come in like a river”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>One who sees a bird in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a bird that wanders from her nest,</b> so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). <b>One who sees a pot in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us,” before a different verse,</b> which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Set on the pot, set it on”</b> (Ezekiel 24:3). |
| Proverbs 27:11 | “Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me” | Berakhot 4a:13 | <b>In his</b> book of <b>wisdom, Solomon said</b> about this wise son: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), as David enjoyed witnessing his son Kilav develop into a Torah luminary to the extent that Kilav was able to respond to Mefivoshet. <b>And</b> Solomon <b>says</b> about Kilav: <b>“Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11). |
| Proverbs 27:18 | his Torah is preserved within him, as it is stated: “One who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof” | Berakhot 57a:7 | <b>One who sees a fig tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his Torah is preserved within him, as it is stated: “One who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof”</b> (Proverbs 27:18). <b>One who sees pomegranates in a dream,</b> if they were <b>small, his business will flourish like the seeds of</b> the <b>pomegranate,</b> which are numerous; and if they were <b>large, his business will increase like a pomegranate.</b> One who saw <b>slices of pomegranates</b> in his dream, <b>if he is a Torah scholar, he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 8:2), which is traditionally understood as an allusion to Torah. <b>And if</b> the dreamer <b>is an ignoramus, he should anticipate mitzvot,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Your temples are like a split pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 4:3). As the Gemara previously interpreted homiletically: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>“Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>]”? Even the most ignorant [<i>reikanin</i>] among you,</b> Israel, <b>are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate.</b> |
| Proverbs 27:27 | goats, his years will be blessed, as it is stated: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, | Berakhot 57a:9 | <b>Rav Yosef says: One who sees a goat in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his year will be blessed;</b> one who sees <b>goats, his years will be blessed, as it is stated: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,</b> for the food of your household; and sustenance for your maidens” (Proverbs 27:27). <b>One who sees myrtle in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his property will be successful. And if he does not</b> own <b>property,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will receive an inheritance. Ulla said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: This</b> applies exclusively to a case <b>where he saw</b> them <b>on their stem. One who sees a citron [<i>etrog</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>he is honored [<i>hadur</i>] before his Creator, as it is stated</b> with regard to the citron: <b>“The fruit of goodly trees [<i>hadar</i>], branches of palm trees”</b> (Leviticus 23:40). <b>One who sees a palm branch [<i>lulav</i>] in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>he has but one heart for his Father in heaven.</b> <i>Lulav</i> is interpreted homiletically as <i>lo lev</i>, he has a heart. |
| Proverbs 28:4 | as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness, and the keepers of the Torah will fight them” | Berakhot 7b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world.</b> Though the ways of the wicked prosper, one is still permitted to provoke them and need not fear (Maharsha), <b>as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness, and the keepers of the Torah will fight them”</b> (Proverbs 28:4). |
| Proverbs 28:14 | replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always” | Berakhot 60a:17 | The Gemara relates: <b>This student was once walking after Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, in the marketplace of Zion.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saw that</b> the student <b>was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid,</b> trembling has seized the ungodly” (Isaiah 33:14). The student <b>replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always”</b> (Proverbs 28:14)? Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> that one should be afraid lest he forget them. For everything else, one must trust in God. |
| Proverbs 28:24 | Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer” | Berakhot 35b:2 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel. |
| Proverbs 30:32 | that which is written: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [ zamota ], lay your hand over your mouth” | Berakhot 63b:20 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [<i>zamota</i>], lay your hand over your mouth”</b> (Proverbs 30:32)? <b>Anyone who abases himself over matters of Torah,</b> asking questions despite the shame he feels for his ignorance, <b>will ultimately be exalted. And if he muzzles [<i>zamam</i>] himself</b> due to embarrassment, he will end up with his <b>hand over</b> his <b>mouth,</b> unable to answer. |
| Proverbs 30:33 | that which is written: “For the churning of milk brings forth curd, and the wringing of the nose [ af ] brings forth blood, so the forcing of wrath [ appayim ] brings forth strife” | Berakhot 63b:16 | <b>In the school of Rabbi Yannai they said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For the churning of milk brings forth curd, and the wringing of the nose [<i>af</i>] brings forth blood, so the forcing of wrath [<i>appayim</i>] brings forth strife”</b> (Proverbs 30:33)? |
| Proverbs 31:6 | for him, as it is stated: “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul” | Berakhot 57a:21 | The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan taught: One who sees any kind of drink in a dream it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen, <b>except for wine,</b> as <b>there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is</b> one <b>who drinks</b> wine <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15), <b>and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul”</b> (Proverbs 31:6). |
| Proverbs 31:26 | that which is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of loving-kindness is on her tongue” | Berakhot 10a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> explanations of other verses <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of loving-kindness is on her tongue”</b> (Proverbs 31:26)? The Sages explain that this chapter discusses the wisdom of Torah and those who engage in its study, so <b>with reference to whom did Solomon say this verse? He said this</b> verse <b>about none other than his father, David,</b> who was the clearest example of one who opens his mouth in wisdom, and <b>who resided in five worlds</b> or stages of life <b>and</b> his soul <b>said a song</b> of praise corresponding to each of them. Five times David said: “Bless the Lord, O my soul,” each corresponding to a different stage of life. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:9 | “There is nothing new under the sun” | Berakhot 59a:3 | The Gemara argues: <b>Then</b> God should have <b>created two other</b> new <b>stars</b> for Pleiades. The Gemara responds: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore</b> those same stars <b>to</b> Ursa Major, <b>as it is stated: “Or can you guide [<i>tanḥem</i>] Ursa</b> Major <b>with her sons?”</b> (Job 38:32), which is interpreted homiletically in the sense of consolation [<i>tanḥumim</i>] apparently due to the restoration of those stars. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:15 | “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered” | Berakhot 26a:19 | With regard to the possibility to compensate for a prayer that he failed to recite at its appointed time, the Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. The meaning of the verse: <b>“That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15), is as follows: <b>That which is crooked cannot be made straight</b> refers to <b>one who omitted the evening <i>Shema</i> and the morning <i>Shema,</i> or the evening prayer, or the morning prayer. And that which is wanting cannot be numbered [<i>lehimanot</i>]</b> refers to <b>one whose friends reached a consensus [<i>nimnu</i>]</b> to perform <b>a mitzva and he was not part of their consensus [<i>nimnu</i>]</b> and, consequently, he missed his opportunity to join them in performance of the mitzva. This <i>baraita</i> clearly states that there is no way to compensate for a missed prayer. |
| Ecclesiastes 3:11 | that which is written: “He has made everything beautiful in its time, | Berakhot 43b:5 | <b>And Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “He has made everything beautiful in its time,</b> and He has placed the world in their heart, yet so man cannot find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end” (Ecclesiastes 3:11)? This <b>teaches that each and every individual, God has made his work pleasant for him in his own eyes.</b> In that way, each individual will be satisfied with his work, enabling the world to function properly. |
| Ecclesiastes 3:14 | And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is worse than lashes, as it is stated: “God has so made it, that men should fear before Him” | Berakhot 55a:15 | Related to what was stated above, that one should pray for a good dream, the Gemara cites additional maxims concerning dreams and their interpretation. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> One should see <b>any dream, and not a fast.</b> In other words, any dream is preferable to a dream during a fast. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A dream not interpreted is like a letter not read.</b> As long as it is not interpreted it cannot be fulfilled; the interpretation of a dream creates its meaning. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A good dream is not entirely fulfilled and a bad dream is not entirely fulfilled. And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is preferable to a good dream,</b> as a bad dream causes one to feel remorse and to repent. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream, his sadness is enough for him; a good dream, his joy is enough for him.</b> This means that the sadness or joy engendered by the dream renders the actual fulfillment of the dream superfluous. Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef said: Even for me, the joy of a good dream negates it.</b> Even Rav Yosef, who was blind and ill, derived such pleasure from a good dream that it was never actually realized. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is worse than lashes, as it is stated: “God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14), <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is a bad dream</b> that causes man to fear. |
| Ecclesiastes 3:14 | straighten the crookedness of the heart, as it is stated: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him” | Berakhot 59a:12 | <b>Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Thunder was created only</b> to impose fear and <b>straighten the crookedness of the heart, as it is stated: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14). <b>And Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees a rainbow in a cloud must fall upon his face, as it is stated: “As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud</b> in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. <b>And when I saw it, I fell upon my face”</b> (Ezekiel 1:28). The colors of the rainbow symbolize the glory of God and one may not stare at them. Yet, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would curse</b> one who fell upon his face when seeing a rainbow <b>because it appears as one who is bowing to the rainbow.</b> As far as <b>blessing</b> is concerned, <b>however,</b> all agree that <b>one certainly recites a blessing. What</b> blessing <b>does one recite? Blessed…Who remembers the covenant</b> with Noah. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that the blessing is: Blessed…<b>Who is faithful to His covenant and fulfills His word. Rav Pappa said: Therefore we will say them both</b> combined: <b>Blessed…Who remembers the covenant and is faithful to His covenant and fulfills His word.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 4:17 | that which is written: “Guard your foot when you go to the house of God, | Berakhot 23a:6 | In this context, the Gemara cites an additional statement, which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Guard your foot when you go to the house of God,</b> and prepare to listen; it is better than when fools offer sacrifices, as they know not to do evil” (Ecclesiastes 4:17)? It means: When you enter the house of the Lord, <b>guard yourself from transgression, and if you commit a transgression, bring a sacrifice before Me</b> in atonement. The verse continues: <b>“And draw near and listen to the words of the wise.” Rava said: Be prepared to hearken to the words of the wise, who, if they commit a transgression, they bring a sacrifice and repent.</b> He interprets the next part of the verse: <b>“It is better than when fools give sacrifices,”</b> that <b>one should not act like the fools who commit a transgression and bring a sacrifice but do not repent.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 5:1 | Rav said in the name of Rabbi Meir: One’s words should always be few before the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Be not rash with your mouth and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and you upon earth. Therefore, let your words be few” | Berakhot 61a:2 | <b>And Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Meir: One’s words should always be few before the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Be not rash with your mouth and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and you upon earth. Therefore, let your words be few”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:1). |
| Ecclesiastes 5:6 | mercy, as it is stated: “For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are many words; but fear God” | Berakhot 10b:1 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: Even if the master of dreams,</b> in a true dream, an angel (<i>Ma’ayan HaBerakhot</i>) <b>tells a person that tomorrow he will die, he should not prevent himself from</b> praying for <b>mercy, as it is stated: “For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are many words; but fear God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:6). Although the dream may seem real to him, that is not necessarily the case, and one must place his trust in God. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:1 | “A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one’s birth” | Berakhot 17a:6 | <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan would conclude</b> study of <b>the book of Job, he said the following:</b> <br><b>A person will ultimately die and an animal will ultimately be slaughtered, and all are destined for death.</b> Therefore, death itself is not a cause for great anguish. <br>Rather, <b>happy is he who grew up in Torah, whose labor is in Torah,</b> <br><b>who gives pleasure to his Creator,</b> <br><b>who grew up with a good name and who took leave of the world with a good name.</b> <br>Such a person lived his life fully, <b>and about him, Solomon said:</b> <br><b>“A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one’s birth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:1); one who was faultless in life reaches the day of his death on a higher level than he was at the outset. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:26 | motzeh , as it is written: “And I find [ motzeh ] the woman more bitter than death” | Berakhot 8a:10 | <b>In Eretz Yisrael,</b> the custom was that <b>when a man married a woman, they would ask him: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motzeh</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom whether the appropriate passage for his wife is the above verse from Proverbs that begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: “He who finds a wife finds good and obtains favor from the Lord”</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motzeh</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motzeh</i>] the woman more bitter than death”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). |
| Ecclesiastes 8:1 | “Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation [ pesher ] of the matter” | Berakhot 10a:26 | With regard to redemption and prayer, the Gemara tells the story of Hezekiah’s illness, his prayer to God, and subsequent recuperation. <b>Rav Hamnuna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> praising the Holy One, Blessed be He: <b>“Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of the matter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1)? This verse means: <b>Who is like the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who knows how to effect compromise [<i>peshara</i>] between two righteous individuals, between Hezekiah,</b> the king of Judea, <b>and Isaiah</b> the prophet. They disagreed over which of them should visit the other. <b>Hezekiah said: Let Isaiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Elijah</b> the prophet, <b>who went to Ahab,</b> the king of Israel, <b>as it is stated: “And Elijah went to appear to Ahab”</b> (I Kings 18:2). This proves that it is the prophet who must seek out the king. <b>And Isaiah said: Let Hezekiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Yehoram ben Ahab,</b> king of Israel, <b>who went to Elisha</b> the prophet, as it is stated: “So the king of Israel, Jehosaphat and the king of Edom went down to him” (II Kings 3:12). |
| Ecclesiastes 9:5 | know so much? Isn’t it stated: “And the dead know nothing” | Berakhot 18a:14 | Rabbi Yonatan <b>said to him: Do</b> the dead <b>know so much? Isn’t it stated: “And the dead know nothing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:5)? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If you read</b> the verse, <b>you did not</b> read it <b>a second time, and if you</b> read it <b>a second time, you did not</b> read it <b>a third time, and if you</b> read it <b>a third time, they did not explain it to you</b> properly. The meaning of the verse: “For the living know that they will die, and the dead know nothing and have no more reward, for their memory has been forgotten” (Ecclesiastes 9:5): <b>For the living know that they will die, these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living.</b> An allusion to this is <b>as it is stated: “And Benayahu, son of Yehoyada, son of a valiant man of Kabze’el, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow”</b> (II Samuel 23:20). |
| Ecclesiastes 9:7 | “Go your way, eat your bread with joy, | Berakhot 56a:5 | They said to him: The verse: <b>“Go your way, eat your bread with joy,</b> and drink your wine with a merry heart” (Ecclesiastes 9:7) <b>was read to us in our dream. To Abaye he said: Your business will profit and you will eat and drink and read the verse out of the joy of your heart. To Rava he said: Your business will be lost, you will slaughter but not eat, you will drink</b> wine and <b>read</b> passages from the Bible in order <b>to allay your fears.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 10:1 | Rav said: The evil inclination is like a fly and it sits between the two entrances of the heart, as it is stated: “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid” | Berakhot 61a:27 | <b>Rav said: The evil inclination is like a fly and it sits between the two entrances of the heart, as it is stated: “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:1). <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The evil inclination <b>is like a type of wheat, as it is stated: “Transgression [<i>ḥatat</i>] couches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7); <i>ḥatat</i> is interpreted homiletically as related to <i>ḥitta</i>, wheat. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:2 | evil is to his left, as it is written: “A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand, but a fool’s understanding is at his left” | Berakhot 61a:28 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person has two kidneys; one advises him to</b> do <b>good and one advises him to</b> do <b>evil. And it stands to reason</b> that the one advising him to do <b>good is to his right and</b> the one that advises him to do <b>evil is to his left, as it is written: “A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand, but a fool’s understanding is at his left”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:2). |
| Ecclesiastes 12:13 | Rav Huna said: Any person who has the fear of Heaven, his words are heeded, as it is stated: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God, | Berakhot 6b:34 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Any person who has the fear of Heaven, his words are heeded, as it is stated: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God,</b> and keep His commandments; for this is all of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). The Gemara explains: “The end of the matter, all having been heard,” refers to the words of one “who keeps His commandments; for this is all of man.” |
| Isaiah 1:9 | As it is stated: “We should have almost been as Sodom, | Berakhot 19a:21 | <b>And Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which <b>it</b> is derived? <b>As it is stated: “We should have almost been as Sodom,</b> we should have been like unto Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10). |
| Isaiah 1:9 | As it is written: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah” | Berakhot 60a:25 | <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>As it is written: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah”</b> (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10).

After the analogy to Sodom was raised, it was realized. |
| Isaiah 1:11 | Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me, | Berakhot 32b:3 | In another comparison, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me,</b> says the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not desire the blood of bulls and sheep and goats” (Isaiah 1:11). <b>And</b> several verses later <b>it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands</b> I will hide My eyes from you, and even if you increase your prayer, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:15). Not only Israel’s sacrifices, but even their prayers, which are on a higher spiritual level, will not be accepted. |
| Isaiah 1:15 | it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands | Berakhot 32b:3 | In another comparison, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me,</b> says the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not desire the blood of bulls and sheep and goats” (Isaiah 1:11). <b>And</b> several verses later <b>it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands</b> I will hide My eyes from you, and even if you increase your prayer, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:15). Not only Israel’s sacrifices, but even their prayers, which are on a higher spiritual level, will not be accepted. |
| Isaiah 1:18 | his transgressions have been forgiven, | Berakhot 57a:18 | The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak taught: One who lets blood in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his transgressions have been forgiven,</b> because red, the color of blood, is a metaphor for sin: “Though your sins be as scarlet…though they be red like crimson” (Isaiah 1:18). Consequently, bloodletting can symbolize transgressions leaving him. |
| Isaiah 1:28 | that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish” | Berakhot 8a:25 | The Gemara again returns to the topic of the synagogue. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the practical halakhic meaning of <b>that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish”</b> (Isaiah 1:28)? <b>This</b> verse <b>refers to one who abandons the Torah</b> scroll when it was taken out to be read <b>and leaves</b> the synagogue, as it appears that he is fleeing from God. |
| Isaiah 2:3 | Because it is stated: “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem” | Berakhot 63b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did the Sages of Eretz Yisrael go <b>to that extent</b> to stop Ḥanina? The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is stated: “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 2:3). |
| Isaiah 2:22 | as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little is he to be accounted” | Berakhot 14a:11 | <b>Rav said: Anyone who greets another</b> person in the morning <b>before he prayed, it is as if he built an altar</b> for idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little is he to be accounted”</b> (Isaiah 2:22). When one’s soul is breathed in through his nostrils in the morning (<i>ge’onim</i>) he should turn to no one other than God. <b>And do not read</b> it as it is written, <b><i>bameh</i>, how; but rather,</b> read <b><i>bama</i>, altar.</b> |
| Isaiah 3:14 | greeting to him and he did not respond, he is called a robber, as it is stated: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard, the spoils of the poor is in your houses” | Berakhot 6b:37 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who is aware that another</b> person <b>is accustomed to greet him</b> is not only obligated to return his greeting, but <b>he</b> must <b>greet him first, as it is stated: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>If</b> the other person <b>extended</b> his <b>greeting to him and he did not respond, he is called a robber, as it is stated: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard, the spoils of the poor is in your houses”</b> (Isaiah 3:14). The only way to steal from a pauper who owns nothing is to rob him of his dignity by refusing to return his greeting. |
| Isaiah 5:9 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said the Lord of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant” | Berakhot 58b:4 | Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: You have nothing about which to sigh, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said the Lord of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant”</b> (Isaiah 5:9). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the <b>future,</b> in the end of days, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore them to their</b> original locations and their <b>inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David. They who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion,</b> which cannot be moved but abides forever” (Psalms 125:1). From this verse one may infer that <b>just as in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore Mount Zion to its inhabited state, so too, in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore the houses of the righteous to their inhabited state,</b> so you have no reason to sigh. <b>Seeing that he was still not satisfied,</b> Ulla <b>said to him: It is enough for a servant to be like his master.</b> Since God leaves His home, the Holy Temple, in ruins, one should not be distraught over the destruction of the houses of the righteous. |
| Isaiah 5:16 | as it is stated: “And the Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice, and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness” | Berakhot 12b:3 | In contrast, <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that one need not be exacting, and <b>even</b> if <b>he said: The holy God</b> during those ten days, he fulfilled his obligation, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice, and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness”</b> (Isaiah 5:16). The Gemara explains: <b>When</b> is it appropriate to describe God with terms like: <b>And the Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice?</b> It is appropriate when God reveals Himself through justice, <b>during the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur,</b> yet the verse <b>says: The holy God.</b> This appellation sufficiently underscores God’s transcendence, and there is no need to change the standard formula. |
| Isaiah 5:18 | “Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity” | Berakhot 24b:20 | <b>Rav Asi said</b> that this is derived from the verse: <b>“Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity”</b> (Isaiah 5:18), meaning that this man brings sin upon himself for naught. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> it is derived <b>from here: “For he has shown contempt for the word of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:31), meaning that uttering God’s word in a place of filth shows contempt for the Lord. |
| Isaiah 6:3 | it is written: “The entire world is full of His glory” | Berakhot 43b:20 | <b>And he may not walk with an upright posture,</b> but slightly bowed, <b>as the Master said: One who walks with an upright posture</b> and in an arrogant manner, <b>even four cubits,</b> it is <b>as if he is pushing away the feet of the Divine Presence,</b> as <b>it is written: “The entire world is full of His glory”</b> (Isaiah 6:3). One who walks in an arrogant way shows a lack of regard for the glory and honor of God that is surrounding him, and thereby chases God from that place. |
| Isaiah 6:6 | Gabriel. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me” | Berakhot 4b:23 | After this discussion of the statement that Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Avina said, another statement of Rabbi Elazar is cited. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Avina said: What was said about</b> the angel <b>Michael is greater than what was said about</b> the angel <b>Gabriel. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), indicating that with a single flight, the seraph arrived and performed his mission, while <b>regarding Gabriel, it is written: “The man, Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly,</b> approached close to me about the time of the evening offering” (Daniel 9:21). The double language used in the phrase “to fly swiftly [<i>muaf biaf]</i>,” indicates that he did not arrive at his destination in a single flight, but rather, that it took him two flights. |
| Isaiah 6:6 | one and one. Here, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me” | Berakhot 4b:25 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>one and one. Here, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), <b>and there, it is written: “And behold, Michael, one of the chief ministers of the king, came to my aid”</b> (Daniel 10:13). Since the verse from Daniel refers to Michael as “one,” which aggadic midrash interprets as “the unique one,” so, too, “one of the seraphs” described in Isaiah must also refer to the unique one, Michael. |
| Isaiah 6:7 | his iniquities are taken away, as it is stated: “And your iniquity is taken away [ vesar avonekh ], and your sin expiated” | Berakhot 57a:5 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One who sees wheat in a dream has seen peace, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you in plenty the fat of wheat”</b> (Psalms 147:14). And <b>one who sees barley [<i>se’orim</i>] in a dream</b> has received a sign that <b>his iniquities are taken away, as it is stated: “And your iniquity is taken away [<i>vesar avonekh</i>], and your sin expiated”</b> (Isaiah 6:7); <i>se’orim</i> is an acronym for <i>sar avon</i>. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: I did not ascend from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael until I saw barley in my dream.</b> |
| Isaiah 10:13 | “I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants” | Berakhot 28a:6 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said to him: You are forbidden to enter into the congregation. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: You are permitted to enter into the congregation. Rabban Gamliel said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord;</b> even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the congregation of the Lord forever” (Deuteronomy 23:4)? How can you permit him to enter the congregation? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Do Ammon and Moab reside in their place? Sennacherib already came and,</b> through his policy of population transfer, <b>scrambled all the nations</b> and settled other nations in place of Ammon. Consequently, the current residents of Ammon and Moab are not ethnic Ammonites and Moabites, <b>as it is stated in</b> reference to Sennacherib: <b>“I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants”</b> (Isaiah 10:13). <b>And</b> although it is conceivable that this particular convert is an ethnic Ammonite, nevertheless, there is no need for concern due to the halakhic principle: <b>Anything that parts</b> from a group <b>parts from the majority,</b> and the assumption is that he is from the majority of nations whose members are permitted to enter the congregation. |
| Isaiah 13:3 | “I have commanded My consecrated ones; | Berakhot 8b:16 | While they have been praised here regarding certain specific aspects of their conduct, the Gemara proceeds to offer another perspective on the Persians based on a verse describing the destruction of Babylonia at the hands of the Persian and Median armies: <b>“I have commanded My consecrated ones;</b> I have also called My mighty ones for My anger, even My proudly exulting ones” (Isaiah 13:3). <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the Persians who are consecrated and designated for Gehenna,</b> for they have been sent by God to carry out his mission of anger, and they will be sent to Gehenna. |
| Isaiah 14:23 | Run, righteous ones, and fulfill the will of your Master. When Mar, son of Ravina, would arrive in Babylonia he would take earth in his kerchief and throw it outside, to fulfill that which is said: “And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction” | Berakhot 57b:22 | The Gemara relates that <b>when Rava would see donkeys carrying earth</b> from Babylonia, <b>he would slap their backs with his hand and say</b> to them: <b>Run, righteous ones, and fulfill the will of your Master. When Mar, son of Ravina, would arrive in Babylonia he would take earth in his kerchief and throw it outside, to fulfill that which is said: “And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). <b>Rav Ashi said: I never heard the</b> statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna,</b> that one who sees Babylonia the wicked must recite five blessings. <b>However, based on my independent reasoning, I recited all of the blessings.</b> |
| Isaiah 14:23 | and pools of water” | Berakhot 58a:1 | With regard to Babylonia, the Gemara cites what <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said:</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed.</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it, <b>as it is written: “I will also make it a possession for the bittern,</b> a wading bird, <b>and pools of water”</b> (Isaiah 14:23); not only will it be destroyed, but the site will become a habitat for destructive, environmentally harmful creatures. When <b>Samaria was cursed,</b> however, <b>its neighbors were blessed, as it is written: “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, a place for the planting of vineyards”</b> (Micah 1:6); although destroyed, it will serve a beneficial purpose. |
| Isaiah 19:13 | from here: “The princes of Tzoan are become fools [ noalu ]” | Berakhot 63b:13 | <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “The princes of Tzoan are become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 19:13). |
| Isaiah 26:12 | a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [ tishpot ] peace for us” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Isaiah 26:20 | “Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes” | Berakhot 7a:15 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that God <b>is</b> only <b>angry for a moment? As it is stated: “His anger is but for a moment, His favor, for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead, <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. |
| Isaiah 27:11 | anyone without knowledge, it is forbidden to have compassion upon him, as it is stated: “For they are a people of no wisdom, so their Creator will have no compassion upon them | Berakhot 33a:19 | <b>And Rav Ami said</b> in praise of knowledge: <b>Great is knowledge that was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated: “For God of knowledge is the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>And</b> since knowledge is regarded so highly, <b>anyone without knowledge, it is forbidden to have compassion upon him, as it is stated: “For they are a people of no wisdom, so their Creator will have no compassion upon them</b> and their Creator will not be gracious unto them” (Isaiah 27:11). If God shows no mercy for those who lack wisdom, all the more so should people refrain from doing so. |
| Isaiah 27:13 | rise early and recite: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great shofar shall be sounded; | Berakhot 56b:11 | <b>One who sees a <i>shofar</i> in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great <i>shofar</i> shall be sounded;</b> and they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt” (Isaiah 27:13), <b>before a different verse,</b> in which the <i>shofar</i> is a symbol of war, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Blow you the horn [<i>shofar</i>] in Giva”</b> (Hosea 5:8). |
| Isaiah 31:5 | a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Isaiah 32:9 | made by the Holy One, Blessed be He, to women than to men, as it is stated: “Rise up, women at ease; hear My voice, confident daughters, listen to what I say” | Berakhot 17a:13 | The Gemara states: <b>Greater is the promise</b> for the future <b>made by the Holy One, Blessed be He, to women than to men, as it is stated: “Rise up, women at ease; hear My voice, confident daughters, listen to what I say”</b> (Isaiah 32:9). This promise of ease and confidence is not given to men. |
| Isaiah 33:6 | Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The Holy One, Blessed be He, has nothing in his treasury other than a treasure of fear of Heaven, as it is stated: “Fear of the Lord is his treasure” | Berakhot 33b:24 | The verse says: What does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear the Lord your God. The Gemara asks: <b>Is fear of Heaven a minor matter</b> that it can be presented as if God is not asking anything significant? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The Holy One, Blessed be He, has nothing in his treasury other than a treasure of fear of Heaven, as it is stated: “Fear of the Lord is his treasure”</b> (Isaiah 33:6). The Lord values and treasures fear of Heaven over all else. |
| Isaiah 33:14 | was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid, | Berakhot 60a:17 | The Gemara relates: <b>This student was once walking after Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, in the marketplace of Zion.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saw that</b> the student <b>was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid,</b> trembling has seized the ungodly” (Isaiah 33:14). The student <b>replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always”</b> (Proverbs 28:14)? Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> that one should be afraid lest he forget them. For everything else, one must trust in God. |
| Isaiah 35:10 | “The redeemed of the Lord shall return, | Berakhot 55b:9 | <b>And three redemptions, as it is written:</b><br><b>“He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me;</b> for they were many that strove with me” (Psalms 55:19);<br><b>“The redeemed of the Lord shall return,</b> and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;<br>they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35:10);<br>and: <b>“The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation</b> in Israel?<br>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not” (I Samuel 14:45). |
| Isaiah 38:1 | as it is stated: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came and said to him: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: Set your house in order, for you will die and you will not live” | Berakhot 10a:27 | <b>What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do</b> to effect compromise between Hezekiah and Isaiah? <b>He brought the suffering</b> of illness <b>upon Hezekiah and told Isaiah: Go and visit the sick.</b> Isaiah did as God instructed, <b>as it is stated: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came and said to him: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: Set your house in order, for you will die and you will not live”</b> (Isaiah 38:1). This seems redundant; <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>you will die and you will not live?</b> This repetition means: <b>You will die in this world, and you will not live,</b> you will have no share, <b>in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Isaiah 38:2 | immediately “Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the Lord” | Berakhot 10b:2 | Having heard Isaiah’s harsh prophecy, <b>immediately “Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 38:2). |
| Isaiah 38:2 | that one who prays should have nothing separating between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed” | Berakhot 5b:21 | The Gemara returns to the topic of prayer. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>Abba Binyamin</b> would <b>say: All of my life I have taken great pains with regard to two things: That my prayer should be before my bed and that my bed should be placed north to south.</b> Abba Binyamin’s statement requires explanation. With regard to his statement: <b>That my prayer should be before my bed,</b> the Gemara asks, <b>what does before my bed</b> mean? <b>If you say</b> that it <b>literally</b> means that he would stand <b>before his bed</b> and pray, it is difficult, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who prays should have nothing separating between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed”</b> (Isaiah 38:2), in order to facilitate his concentration during prayer. That being said, why would Abba Binyamin pray before his bed? Rather, <b>do not say</b> that <b>before my bed</b> refers to where he stood during prayer, but <b>rather, say</b> that he prayed <b>adjacent to</b> the time that he would retire to <b>bed;</b> he was careful to recite <i>Shema</i> and recite the evening prayer just before going to sleep (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). |
| Isaiah 38:3 | upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You” | Berakhot 10b:13 | <b>Hezekiah,</b> however, <b>based</b> his request <b>upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You”</b> (Isaiah 38:3). When God answered his prayers, <b>it was based upon the merit of others</b> with no mention made of Hezekiah’s own merit, <b>as it is stated: “And I will protect this city to save it, for My sake and for the sake of David, My servant”</b> (II Kings 19:34). <b>And that is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness;</b> but You have, in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back” (Isaiah 38:17)? This verse teaches that <b>even when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent him peace</b> and told him that he would recover from his illness, <b>it was bitter for him,</b> because God did not take his merit into consideration. |
| Isaiah 38:3 | please remember that I walked before You in truth, and with a complete heart, and what was good in Your eyes I did. | Berakhot 10b:4 | <b>Rabbi Levi said:</b> Hezekiah intended to evoke <b>matters</b> relating <b>to a wall,</b> and <b>he said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, and if the woman from Shunem, who made only a single small wall</b> on the roof for the prophet Elisha, and <b>you revived her son, all the more so</b> should you bring life to the descendant of <b>my father’s father,</b> King Solomon, <b>who covered the entire</b> Temple <b>Sanctuary with silver and gold.</b> In his prayer, Hezekiah said: “Please, Lord, <b>please remember that I walked before You in truth, and with a complete heart, and what was good in Your eyes I did.</b> And Hezekiah wept sore” (Isaiah 38:3). |
| Isaiah 38:14 | [ delu’im ] | Berakhot 56b:14 | <b>The Sages teach: One who sees a reed [<i>kaneh</i>] in a dream should expect wisdom, as it is stated: “Get [<i>kene</i>] wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). One who sees several <b>reeds [<i>kanim</i>] should expect understanding, as it said: “Yea, with all your acquisitions [<i>kinyanekha</i>] acquire understanding”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Pumpkin [<i>kara</i>], heart of palm [<i>kura</i>], wax [<i>kira</i>], and reed [<i>kanya</i>], are all advantageous when one dreams</b> about them. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A pumpkin is only shown</b> in a dream <b>to one who fears Heaven with all his might,</b> because pumpkins <b>[<i>delu’im</i>]</b> are interpreted as an acronym for <i>dalu einai lamarom</i>, “My eyes were raised on high” (Isaiah 38:14). |
| Isaiah 38:16 | You will recover me [ vataḥlimeni ], and make me to live” | Berakhot 55a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: Three</b> matters <b>require</b> a plea for <b>mercy</b> to bring them about: <b>A good king, a good year, and a good dream.</b> These three, kings, years, and dreams, are all bestowed by God and one must pray that they should be positive and constructive. The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses:</b> He turns it whithersoever He will” (Proverbs 21:1). A <b>good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). And a <b>good dream, as it is written:</b> “O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore <b>You will recover me [<i>vataḥlimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). Due to their apparent etymological similarity, the word <i>taḥlimeni</i> is interpreted as deriving from the word <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 38:16 | A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [ vataḥalimeni ], and make me to live” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 38:17 | that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness; | Berakhot 10b:13 | <b>Hezekiah,</b> however, <b>based</b> his request <b>upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You”</b> (Isaiah 38:3). When God answered his prayers, <b>it was based upon the merit of others</b> with no mention made of Hezekiah’s own merit, <b>as it is stated: “And I will protect this city to save it, for My sake and for the sake of David, My servant”</b> (II Kings 19:34). <b>And that is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness;</b> but You have, in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back” (Isaiah 38:17)? This verse teaches that <b>even when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent him peace</b> and told him that he would recover from his illness, <b>it was bitter for him,</b> because God did not take his merit into consideration. |
| Isaiah 42:3 | rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break” | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Isaiah 42:5 | “Who creates [ boreh ] the heavens and stretches them out” | Berakhot 52b:29 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> How can there be a dispute over the meaning of the word <i>boreh</i>? In the following verses it is clear that it refers to acts of creation in the past: <b>“Who forms light and creates [<i>boreh</i>] darkness”</b> (Isaiah 45:7), <b>“Who forms mountains and creates [<i>boreh</i>] wind”</b> (Amos 4:13), or <b>“Who creates [<i>boreh</i>] the heavens and stretches them out”</b> (Isaiah 42:5). <b>Rather, said Rav Yosef: With regard to both <i>bara</i> and <i>boreh</i>, everyone agrees that</b> they <b>mean created.

| Isaiah 43:4 | “Therefore I will give man [ adam ] for you” | Berakhot 62b:6 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar entered a bathroom. This Roman came and pushed him</b> away. <b>Rabbi Elazar stood and left,</b> and <b>a serpent came and ripped out the intestines</b> of the Roman. <b>Rabbi Elazar recited the</b> following <b>verse about</b> the Roman: <b>“Therefore I will give man [<i>adam</i>] for you”</b> (Isaiah 43:4); <b>do not read</b> it as <b><i>adam</i>, but rather read</b> it as <b>Edom,</b> meaning a Roman. |
| Isaiah 43:18 | “Do not remember the former events, and do not ponder things of old” | Berakhot 13a:1 | <b>not that</b> the name <b>Jacob will be</b> entirely <b>uprooted from its place, but that</b> the name <b>Israel</b> will be the <b>primary</b> name <b>to which</b> the name <b>Jacob</b> will be <b>secondary,</b> as the Torah continues to refer to him as Jacob after this event. <b>And it also says</b> that the ultimate redemption will overshadow the previous redemption in the verse: <b>“Do not remember the former events, and do not ponder things of old”</b> (Isaiah 43:18), and the Gemara explains: <b>“Do not remember the former events,” that is the subjugation to the kingdoms, and “do not ponder things of old,” that is the exodus from Egypt,</b> which occurred before the subjugation to the nations. |
| Isaiah 43:19 | “Behold, I will do new things, now it will spring forth” | Berakhot 13a:2 | With regard to the following verse: <b>“Behold, I will do new things, now it will spring forth”</b> (Isaiah 43:19), <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This refers to the</b> future <b>war of Gog and Magog,</b> which will cause all earlier events to be forgotten. |
| Isaiah 45:7 | “Who forms light and creates darkness, | Berakhot 11b:1 | <b>“Who forms light and creates darkness,</b> Who makes peace and creates evil, I am the Lord Who does all these things” (Isaiah 45:7). |
| Isaiah 45:7 | “Who forms light and creates [ boreh ] darkness” | Berakhot 52b:29 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> How can there be a dispute over the meaning of the word <i>boreh</i>?

| Isaiah 46:12 | “Hear Me, stubborn-hearted who are far from charity” | Berakhot 17b:2 | Having cited a dispute with regard to the interpretation of a verse where we are uncertain whether the dispute is between Rav and Shmuel or Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar, the Gemara cites another verse with regard to which there is a similar dispute. It is said: <b>“Hear Me, stubborn-hearted who are far from charity”</b> (Isaiah 46:12). While both agree that the verse refers to the righteous, <b>Rav and Shmuel, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar,</b> disagreed as to how to interpret the verse. <b>One said: The entire world is sustained by</b> God’s <b>charity,</b> not because it deserves to exist, <b>while</b> the righteous who are far from God’s charity <b>are sustained by force,</b> as due to their own good deeds they have the right to demand their sustenance. <b>And one said: The entire world is sustained by the merit</b> of <b>their</b> righteousness, <b>while they are not sustained</b> at all, <b>not even by their own merit, in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said.</b> |
| Isaiah 47:2 | nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers” | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet stated:</b> Even <b>a woman’s hair is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> for it too is praised, <b>as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats,</b> trailing down from Mount Gilead” (Song of Songs 4:1). |
| Isaiah 47:3 | “Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen” | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14).

| Isaiah 49:8 | from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you” | Berakhot 8a:2 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that</b> the unique quality of communal prayer is derived <b>from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8). |
| Isaiah 50:2 | He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one? When I called, there was no one to answer… | Berakhot 6b:5 | On this same topic, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, enters a synagogue and does not find ten</b> people there, <b>He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one? When I called, there was no one to answer…</b>Behold, with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness” (Isaiah 50:2). |
| Isaiah 50:3 | Rav Ḥisda said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the firmament has not been seen in its purity, as it is said: “I clothe the heavens with blackness and I make sackcloth their covering” | Berakhot 59a:15 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> in this they <b>disagree with Rafram bar Pappa</b> who said that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, as Rafram bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the firmament has not been seen in its purity, as it is said: “I clothe the heavens with blackness and I make sackcloth their covering”</b> (Isaiah 50:3). |
| Isaiah 50:10 | as it is stated: “Who among you fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of His servant? Though he walks in darkness and has no light, | Berakhot 6b:2 | Additionally, <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who is accustomed to come to the synagogue and did not come one day, the Holy One, Blessed be He, asks about him,</b> as it were, to determine what happened to him, <b>as it is stated: “Who among you fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of His servant? Though he walks in darkness and has no light,</b> let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God” (Isaiah 50:10). In other words, God asks, who among you fears the Lord yet did not come to hear the voice of His servant the prayer leader, who engages in the service of God? He who went out before dawn and walks in darkness before prayer. |
| Isaiah 51:14 | it is a good omen for him, as it is stated: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; | Berakhot 57a:14 | <b>One who defecates</b> in a dream, <b>it is a good omen for him, as it is stated: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed;</b> and he shall not go down dying into the pit, neither shall his bread fail” (Isaiah 51:14). The Gemara notes that <b>this only applies</b> where <b>he does not wipe</b> and get his hands dirty. |
| Isaiah 51:14 | Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 52:7 | rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite:</b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall,</b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Isaiah 53:10 | A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 53:10 | Rav Huna said: Anyone in whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, delights, He oppresses him with suffering, as it is stated: “Yet in whom the Lord delights, He oppresses him with disease; | Berakhot 5a:11 | So too, <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Anyone in whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, delights, He oppresses him with suffering, as it is stated: “Yet in whom the Lord delights, He oppresses him with disease;</b> to see if his soul would offer itself in guilt, that he might see his children, lengthen his days, and that the desire of the Lord might prosper by his hand” (Isaiah 53:10). This verse illustrates that in whomever God delights, he afflicts with illness. |
| Isaiah 54:1 | A certain heretic said to Berurya: It is written: “Sing, barren woman who has not given birth, | Berakhot 10a:5 | The Gemara relates an additional example of Berurya’s incisive insight: <b>A certain heretic said to Berurya: It is written: “Sing, barren woman who has not given birth,</b> open forth in song and cry, you did not travail, for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the Lord” (Isaiah 54:1). <b>Because she has not given birth,</b> she should <b>sing</b> and rejoice? |
| Isaiah 54:13 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is said: “And all your children [ banayikh ] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children” | Berakhot 64a:13 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is said: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). If all the children of Israel are taught of the Lord, there will be peace for all. |
| Isaiah 56:7 | that the Holy One, Blessed be He, prays? As it is stated: “I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in the house of My prayer” | Berakhot 7a:1 | Along the same lines, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, prays? As it is stated: “I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in the house of My prayer”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). The verse <b>does not say</b> the house of <b>their prayer, but rather, “</b>the house of <b>My prayer”; from here</b> we see <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, prays.</b> |
| Isaiah 56:11 | “Yea, the dogs are greedy” | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Isaiah 57:19 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: As the verse stated: “The Lord that creates the expression of the lips says, Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near; and I will heal him” | Berakhot 34b:17 | We learned in the mishna: <b>They said about Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Dosa that the indication whether or not his prayer was accepted was whether the prayer was fluent in his mouth as he recited it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that this is an accurate indication of whether or not his prayer was accepted, derived? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: As the verse stated: “The Lord that creates the expression of the lips says, Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near; and I will heal him”</b> (Isaiah 57:19). It can be inferred from this verse that if speech of the lips, fluent speech, is granted to one who prays, it indicates that his prayer on behalf of the ill has been accepted and I will heal him, that person will be healed. |
| Isaiah 57:19 | “Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the Lord that creates the expression of the lips; and I will heal him” | Berakhot 55b:10 | <b>And three</b> mentions of <b>peace, as it is written:</b><br><b>“Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the Lord that creates the expression of the lips; and I will heal him”</b> (Isaiah 57:19); <br><b>“Then the spirit clothed Amasai,</b> who was chief of the captains: Yours are we, David, and on your side, you son of Yishai;<br><b>peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers”</b> (I Chronicles 12:19);<br>and: <b>“Thus you shall say: All hail and peace be both unto you,</b><br><b>and peace be to your house,</b> and peace be unto all that you have” (I Samuel 25:6). |
| Isaiah 59:19 | “For distress will come in like a river” | Berakhot 56b:9 | Since rivers, birds, and pots have ambiguous connotations, it is recommended that someone who sees them in a dream recite a verse that interprets the dream positively. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, <b>one who sees a river in a dream</b> should <b>rise early</b> and <b>recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For distress will come in like a river”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>One who sees a bird in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a bird that wanders from her nest,</b> so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). <b>One who sees a pot in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us,” before a different verse,</b> which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Set on the pot, set it on”</b> (Ezekiel 24:3). |
| Isaiah 61:5 | when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks, | Berakhot 35b:7 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Is it possible that a person plows in the plowing season and sows in the sowing season and harvests in the harvest season and threshes in the threshing season and winnows in the windy season,</b> as grain is separated from the chaff by means of the wind, and is constantly busy; <b>what will become of Torah? Rather,</b> one must dedicate himself exclusively to Torah at the expense of other endeavors; as <b>when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks,</b> and foreigners will be your plowmen and your vinedressers” (Isaiah 61:5). <b>When Israel does not perform God’s will, their work is performed by them</b> themselves, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall gather your grain.” Moreover,</b> if Israel fails to perform God’s will, <b>others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy</b> whom God shall send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness and in want of all things” (Deuteronomy 28:48). |
| Isaiah 62:8 | that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wears phylacteries? As it is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength” | Berakhot 6a:17 | The Gemara cites another aggadic statement: <b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wears phylacteries? As it is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength”</b> (Isaiah 62:8). Since it is customary to swear upon holy objects, it is understood that His right hand and the arm of His strength are the holy objects upon which God swore. |
| Isaiah 63:3 | “Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Isaiah 64:3 | no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, who will do for those who await Him” | Berakhot 34b:18 | In conclusion of this discussion, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to the reward of the righteous: <b>All the prophets only prophesied</b> in their prophecies of consolation, <b>with regard to one who</b> values wisdom and therefore <b>marries his daughter to a Torah scholar and to one who conducts business [<i>perakmatya</i>] on behalf of a Torah scholar as well as to one who</b> utilizes his wealth <b>to benefit a Torah scholar</b> in some other way. <b>However,</b> the prophets did not describe the extent of the reward for <b>Torah scholars themselves,</b> whose reward is not quantifiable as it is stated: “And from of old they have not heard, they have not lent an ear, <b>no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3). |
| Isaiah 66:1 | as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool” | Berakhot 59a:6 | <b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily over His dwelling place, <b>He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 25:30). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>forces His feet beneath the throne of glory</b> and the world quakes, <b>as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). |
| Isaiah 66:12 | A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Jeremiah 2:6 | that which is written: “In a land through which no man has passed and where no person [ adam ] has settled” | Berakhot 31a:15 | Rav Shimi bar Ashi <b>said to him: You reminded me of something that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> said, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “In a land through which no man has passed and where no person [<i>adam</i>] has settled”</b> (Jeremiah 2:6)? This verse is difficult; <b>since it is</b> a land through which <b>no</b> person <b>has passed, how</b> could anyone <b>have settled</b> there permanently? The statement that “no person has settled there” is redundant. <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to teach</b> that <b>every land</b> through <b>which Adam the first</b> man passed and <b>decreed that it would be settled was settled, and every land</b> through <b>which</b> Adam passed and <b>decreed that it would not be settled was not settled.</b> Based on this, what people say is true, and the palm trees of Babylonia are from the time of Adam, meaning that from the time of Adam this land was decreed to be suitable for growing palm trees (<i>Me’iri</i>). The Gemara cited an example of how one who parts from another with Torah learns something new. |
| Jeremiah 4:7 | “A lion is gone up from his thicket, | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Jeremiah 4:19 | “My anguish, my anguish, I am in pain. The chambers of my heart. | Berakhot 10b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the word <b>“wall [<i>kir</i>]”</b> in this context? Why did Hezekiah turn his face to a wall? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> This symbolically alludes to the fact that Hezekiah prayed to God <b>from the chambers [<i>kirot</i>] of his heart, as it is stated</b> elsewhere: <b>“My anguish, my anguish, I am in pain. The chambers of my heart.</b> My heart moans within me” (Jeremiah 4:19). |
| Jeremiah 6:7 | “As a cistern wells with her waters, | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Jeremiah 7:16 | “And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [ tifga ] Me | Berakhot 26b:7 | <b>Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “And he encountered [<i>vayifga</i>] the place and he slept there</b> for the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). The word <b>encounter</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated</b> when God spoke to Jeremiah: <b>“And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [<i>tifga</i>] Me</b> for I do not hear you” (Jeremiah 7:16). Jacob prayed during the evening, after the sun had set. |
| Jeremiah 9:9 | “For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing” | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite:</b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall,</b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Jeremiah 10:10 | “And the Lord, God, is True” | Berakhot 14b:1 | <b>“And the Lord, God, is True”</b> (Jeremiah 10:10). |
| Jeremiah 10:13 | clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens” | Berakhot 59a:7 | We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna that <b>over thunder</b> one recites: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> causes <b>thunder? Shmuel said:</b> When the <b>clouds</b> located <b>in the curvature</b> of the firmament collide with the firmament itself, they produce this sound, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook”</b> (Psalms 77:19). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Thunder is the sound of <b>clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Thunder is caused by <b>a powerful lightning bolt that flashes in the cloud and shatters the hailstones. Rav Ashi said:</b> Because the <b>clouds are hollow, and</b> when <b>the wind comes and blows across their mouths,</b> it sounds like <b>wind blowing in the mouth of a jug.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov; as lightning flashes, the clouds rumble, and the rain comes.</b> |
| Jeremiah 11:16 | a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit” | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream,</b> and they were <b>small,</b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but,</b> one who sees olive <b>trees,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants,</b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Gemara likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Jeremiah 12:14 | in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit, | Berakhot 8a:5 | Continuing to extol communal prayer, <b>Reish Lakish said: One who has a synagogue</b> nearby <b>in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit,</b> behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them” (Jeremiah 12:14). One who only touches, but does not enter the place of prayer, My inheritance, is considered an evil neighbor. <b>And furthermore,</b> he is punished in that <b>he causes himself and his children</b> to go into <b>exile, as it is stated: “Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them.”</b> |
| Jeremiah 18:6 | it is written: “Behold, like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel” | Berakhot 32a:3 | <b>One</b> is the verse just mentioned in which <b>it is written: “Those whom I have dealt in wickedness.” And one</b> is the verse in which <b>it is written: “Behold, like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel”</b> (Jeremiah 18:6). <b>And one</b> is the verse in which <b>it is written:</b> “And I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will place within you, <b>and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh”</b> (Ezekiel 36:26). These three verses indicate that God influences a person’s decisions, and therefore one does not have sole responsibility for his actions. |
| Jeremiah 23:28 | “The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has the straw to do with the grain? says the Lord” | Berakhot 55a:16 | With regard to the verse: <b>“The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has the straw to do with the grain? says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:28), the Gemara asks: <b>What do straw and grain have to do with a dream? Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai: Just as it is impossible for the grain</b> to grow <b>without straw, so too it is impossible to dream without idle matters.</b> Even a dream that will be fulfilled in the future contains some element of nonsense. |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | said to him: My son, open your mouth and let your words illuminate, as matters of Torah do not become ritually impure, as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord” | Berakhot 22a:8 | Further elaborating on the issue of Torah study while in a state of impurity, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira would say: Matters of Torah do not become ritually impure</b> and therefore one who is impure is permitted to engage in Torah study. He implemented this <i>halakha</i> in practice. The Gemara relates <b>an incident involving a student who was</b> reciting <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> <b>hesitantly before</b> the study hall of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b> The student experienced a seminal emission, and when he was asked to recite he did so in a rushed, uneven manner, as he did not want to utter the words of Torah explicitly. Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: My son, open your mouth and let your words illuminate, as matters of Torah do not become ritually impure, as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as fire does not become ritually impure, so too matters of Torah do not become ritually impure.</b> |
| Jeremiah 25:30 | over His dwelling place, | Berakhot 3a:6 | The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds that the night consists of three watches,</b> and he employs this particular language of watches <b>in order to teach us: There are watches in heaven and there are watches on earth;</b> just as our night is divided into watches, so too is the night in the upper worlds. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and roars like a lion</b> in pain over the destruction of the Temple. This imagery is derived from a reference in the Bible, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord roars [<i>yishag</i>] from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily</b> [<b><i>shaog yishag</i></b>] <b>over His dwelling place,</b> He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” (Jeremiah 25:30). The three instances of the root <i>shin-alef-gimmel</i> in this verse correspond to the three watches of the night. |
| Jeremiah 25:30 | He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” | Berakhot 59a:6 | <b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily over His dwelling place, <b>He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 25:30). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>forces His feet beneath the throne of glory</b> and the world quakes, <b>as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). |
| Jeremiah 27:22 | as Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord” | Berakhot 24b:8 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Abba was avoiding</b> being seen <b>by</b> his teacher <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as Rabbi Abba <b>sought to ascend to Eretz Yisrael</b> and his teacher disapproved, <b>as Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 27:22). Rabbi Abba did not want to discuss his desire to emigrate with Rav Yehuda. Nevertheless <b>he said: I will go and hear something from him at the hall</b> where the Sages <b>assemble,</b> without being seen, <b>and afterwards I will leave</b> Babylonia. |
| Jeremiah 31:3 | An eternal love, and so it says: “And an eternal love I have loved you, therefore I have drawn you with kindness” | Berakhot 11b:9 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not recite: An eternal love [<i>ahavat olam</i>]; rather,</b> one recites: <b>An abounding love. And the Rabbis say</b> that one recites: <b>An eternal love, and so it says: “And an eternal love I have loved you, therefore I have drawn you with kindness”</b> (Jeremiah 31:3). |
| Jeremiah 31:12 | for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow” | Berakhot 55b:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Three transformations:</b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing;</b><br><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12);<br><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together;</b><br><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12);<br>and: <b>“Nevertheless the Lord your God would not hearken unto Balaam;</b><br><b>but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). |
| Jeremiah 32:18 | iniquity. Here, it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated,” and there it is written: “He repays the iniquity of the fathers onto the bosom of their children” | Berakhot 5b:3 | An answer was provided to Rabbi Yoḥanan when <b>a certain elder taught him in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai:</b> This conclusion <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the words <b>iniquity</b> and <b>iniquity. Here, it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated,” and there it is written: “He repays the iniquity of the fathers onto the bosom of their children”</b> (Jeremiah 32:18). Because he “repays the iniquity of the fathers onto the bosom of their children,” the father’s transgressions are forgiven. |
| Jeremiah 33:11 | as it is stated: “The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts, | Berakhot 6b:29 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Anyone who benefits from the feast of a groom but does not cause him to rejoice violates the five voices</b> mentioned in this verse, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,</b> for the Lord is good, for His mercy lasts forever, even of those who bring a thanks-offering to the house of the Lord. For I will restore the captivity of the land as it was in the beginning, says the Lord” (Jeremiah 33:11). These five voices in the context of a bride and groom correspond to the five voices mentioned in the context of the revelation at Sinai, as in Song of Songs, the day of the revelation at Sinai is alluded to by the phrase: His wedding day (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto, Maharsha). |
| Jeremiah 49:6 | But wasn’t it already stated: “But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says the Lord” | Berakhot 28a:7 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>But wasn’t it already stated: “But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 49:6) <b>and they have already returned</b> to their land? Therefore, he is an ethnic Ammonite and he may not convert. |
| Jeremiah 50:12 | multitudes of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed, | Berakhot 58a:2 | <b>And Rav Hamnuna said: One who sees multitudes of Israel,</b> six hundred thousand Jews, <b>recites: Blessed…Who knows all secrets.</b> One who sees <b>multitudes of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed,</b> she that bore you shall be confounded; behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert” (Jeremiah 50:12). |
| Jeremiah 50:12 | graves of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed, | Berakhot 58b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who sees graves of Israel recites:</b> <br><b>Blessed…Who formed you in judgment,</b><br><b>and Who nourished you in judgment,</b><br><b>and Who sustained you in judgment,</b><br><b>and collected</b> your soul <b>in judgment,</b><br><b>and in the future will raise you</b> from the dead <b>in judgment.</b><br>And <b>Mar, son of Ravina, concludes</b> the formula of this blessing <b>in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b><br><b>And Who knows the number of you all,</b><br><b>and Who in the future will restore you to life and sustain you.</b><br><b>Blessed…Who revives the dead.</b><br>One who sees <b>graves of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed,</b> she who bore you shall be confounded; behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert” (Jeremiah 50:12). |
| Jeremiah 50:36 | that which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [ habaddim ], and they shall become fools [ noalu ]” | Berakhot 63b:12 | The Gemara interprets the word <b><i>hasket</i></b> in this verse homiletically, as an acronym of the words <i>as</i>, make, and <i>kat</i>, group. <b>Form [<i>asu</i>] many groups [<i>kitot</i>] and study Torah, for the Torah is only acquired</b> through study <b>in a group.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina; as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [<i>habaddim</i>], and they shall become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? This verse can be interpreted homiletically: <b>A sword upon the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for the Torah scholars themselves, <b>who sit alone [<i>bad bevad</i>] and study Torah. And furthermore,</b> those who study alone <b>grow foolish, as it is written here, <i>noalu</i>, and elsewhere it is written</b> that after Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, Aaron told Moses: <b>“For that we have done foolishly [<i>noalnu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>And furthermore, they sin</b> due to that ignorance, <b>as</b> at the end of that same verse <b>it is stated:</b> “For that we have done foolishly, <b>and for that we have sinned.”</b> |
| Lamentations 1:4 | from here: “Her virgins are sorrowed [ nugot ] and she is embittered” | Berakhot 28a:19 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Regarding anyone who recites the morning prayer after four hours</b> of the day, <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are in sorrow [<i>nugei</i>] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you,</b> they who carried for you the burden of insult” (Zephaniah 3:18). <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that <i>nugei</i> is an expression of sorrow? As it is written: “My soul drips in sorrow [<i>tuga</i>]”</b> (Psalms 119:28). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The proof that <i>nugei</i> indicates suffering is <b>from here: “Her virgins are sorrowed [<i>nugot</i>] and she is embittered”</b> (Lamentations 1:4). |
| Lamentations 3:8 | “Though I plead and call out, He shuts out my prayer” | Berakhot 32b:5 | On the subject of prayer, <b>Rabbi Elazar also said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the gates of prayer were locked</b> and prayer is not accepted as it once was, <b>as it is said</b> in lamentation of the Temple’s destruction: <b>“Though I plead and call out, He shuts out my prayer”</b> (Lamentations 3:8). Yet, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that the gates of prayer were locked</b> with the destruction of the Temple, <b>the gates of tears were not locked,</b> and one who cries before God may rest assured that his prayers will be answered, <b>as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears”</b> (Psalms 39:13). Since this prayer is a request that God should pay heed to the tears of one who is praying, he is certain that at least the gates of tears are not locked. |
| Lamentations 3:40 | as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God” | Berakhot 5a:9 | Previously, the Gemara discussed suffering that results from one’s transgressions. The Gemara shifts the focus and discusses suffering that does not result from one’s transgressions and the suffering of the righteous. <b>Rava, and some say Rav Ḥisda, said: If a person sees that suffering has befallen him, he should examine his actions.</b> Generally, suffering comes about as punishment for one’s transgressions, <b>as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God”</b> (Lamentations 3:40). <b>If he examined</b> his ways and <b>found no</b> transgression for which that suffering is appropriate, <b>he may attribute</b> his suffering <b>to dereliction</b> in the study <b>of Torah.</b> God punishes an individual for dereliction in the study of Torah in order to emphasize the gravity of the issue, <b>as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law”</b> (Psalms 94:12). This verse teaches us that his suffering will cause him to return to Your law. |
| Lamentations 3:44 | Rava did not decree a fast on a cloudy day because it is stated: “You have covered Yourself in a cloud, through which prayer cannot pass” | Berakhot 32b:6 | With regard to the locking of the gates of prayer, the Gemara relates that <b>Rava did not decree a fast on a cloudy day because it is stated: “You have covered Yourself in a cloud, through which prayer cannot pass”</b> (Lamentations 3:44). The verse indicates that clouds are a bad omen, indicating that God has averted His face (Rav Hai Gaon). |
| Lamentations 4:22 | his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion” | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream,</b> and they were <b>small,</b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but,</b> one who sees olive <b>trees,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants,</b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Gemara likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Ezekiel 1:7 | it is stated: “And their feet were a straight foot” | Berakhot 10b:28 | <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: When praying, one should align his feet</b> next to each other, as a single foot, in order to model oneself after the angels, with regard to whom <b>it is stated: “And their feet were a straight foot”</b> (Ezekiel 1:7). |
| Ezekiel 1:28 | And when I saw it, I fell upon my face” | Berakhot 59a:12 | <b>Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Thunder was created only</b> to impose fear and <b>straighten the crookedness of the heart, as it is stated: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14). <b>And Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees a rainbow in a cloud must fall upon his face, as it is stated: “As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud</b> in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. <b>And when I saw it, I fell upon my face”</b> (Ezekiel 1:28). The colors of the rainbow symbolize the glory of God and one may not stare at them. Yet, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would curse</b> one who fell upon his face when seeing a rainbow <b>because it appears as one who is bowing to the rainbow.</b> As far as <b>blessing</b> is concerned, <b>however,</b> all agree that <b>one certainly recites a blessing. What</b> blessing <b>does one recite? Blessed…Who remembers the covenant</b> with Noah. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that the blessing is: Blessed…<b>Who is faithful to His covenant and fulfills His word.

| Ezekiel 4:3 | “And take for yourself an iron griddle, and set it as an iron wall between yourself and the city… | Berakhot 32b:7 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed an iron wall separates Israel from their Father in heaven, as it is stated</b> to the prophet Ezekiel, instructing him to symbolize that separation: <b>“And take for yourself an iron griddle, and set it as an iron wall between yourself and the city…</b>it will be a sign for the house of Israel” (Ezekiel 4:3). |
| Ezekiel 5:13 | and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased” | Berakhot 59a:6 | <b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily over His dwelling place, <b>He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 25:30). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>forces His feet beneath the throne of glory</b> and the world quakes, <b>as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). |
| Ezekiel 16:7 | “Your breasts were formed and your hair was grown” | Berakhot 24a:12 | <b>The Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If his children and the members of his household were minors,</b> even though they are unclothed, <b>it is permitted</b> to recite <i>Shema</i> even without a garment separating between them. The Gemara asks: <b>Until what</b> age is one still considered a minor? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A girl</b> until she is <b>three years and one day old, and a boy</b> until <b>he is nine years and one day old,</b> for these are the ages from which a sexual act in which they participate is considered a sexual act. <b>Some say: A girl eleven years and one day old and a boy of twelve years and one day old,</b> as that is the age at which they are considered adults in this regard. This age is only approximate, as the age of majority for both <b>this,</b> the boy, <b>and that,</b> the girl, is <b>at</b> the onset of puberty in accordance with the verse: <b>“Your breasts were formed and your hair was grown”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7). |
| Ezekiel 16:63 | as it is stated: “In order that you remember, and be embarrassed, and never open your mouth anymore, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done, said the Lord, God” | Berakhot 12b:9 | <b>And Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava said in the name of Rav: One who commits an act of transgression and is ashamed of it, all of his transgressions are forgiven.</b> Shame is a sign that one truly despises his transgressions and that shame has the power to atone for his actions (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto), <b>as it is stated: “In order that you remember, and be embarrassed, and never open your mouth anymore, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done, said the Lord, God”</b> (Ezekiel 16:63). |
| Ezekiel 18:24 | written: “And when the righteous one returns from his righteousness and does wicked | Berakhot 29a:5 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>And</b> does he <b>not</b> become wicked? <b>Isn’t it</b> explicitly <b>written: “And when the righteous one returns from his righteousness and does wicked</b> like all of the abominations that the wicked one has done, will he live? All of the righteous deeds that he has done will not be remembered given the treachery that he has carried out, and in his sin that he has transgressed, for these he shall die” (Ezekiel 18:24)? Abaye responds: <b>That</b> verse refers to a righteous individual who was <b>initially wicked</b> and repented, but ultimately returned to his evil ways. <b>However, one who is initially righteous</b> does <b>not</b> become wicked. |
| Ezekiel 20:25 | Rabbi Meyasha, son of the son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, said: Of him the verse says: “Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and laws by which they could not live” | Berakhot 24b:19 | The Gemara asks: If <b>one did not stop, what</b> is his status? <b>Rabbi Meyasha, son of the son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, said: Of him the verse says: “Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and laws by which they could not live”</b> (Ezekiel 20:25), as in this case following these statutes and laws led to sin, not to mitzva. |
| Ezekiel 21:11 | Ulla and Rav Ḥisda were once walking along the road when they came upon the doorway of the house of Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai. Rav Ḥisda groaned and sighed.

| Ezekiel 21:22 | as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury; | Berakhot 59a:6 | <b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard.

| Ezekiel 21:30 | “And you are a slain, wicked prince of Israel” | Berakhot 18b:3 | In contrast to the righteous, who are referred to as living even after their death, the verse states explicitly: <b>“The dead know nothing.” These are the wicked, who</b> even <b>during their lives are called dead, as</b> the prophet Ezekiel <b>said</b> in reference to a king of Israel who was alive: <b>“And you are a slain, wicked prince of Israel”</b> (Ezekiel 21:30). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses the dead shall be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). This is puzzling. As long as the accused has not been sentenced to death, he <b>is alive. Rather,</b> this person who is wicked is considered <b>dead from the outset.</b> |
| Ezekiel 23:20 | “Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys” | Berakhot 25b:11 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: Opposite a naked gentile, it is forbidden to recite <i>Shema</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why did</b> Rav Yehuda discuss <b>particularly</b> the case of <b>a gentile? Even with regard to a Jew</b> it is <b>also</b> prohibited. The Gemara replies: Opposite the nakedness of <b>a Jew, it is obvious</b> that it is <b>prohibited; however,</b> opposite the nakedness of <b>a gentile, it was necessary for him</b> to say. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>since it is written about</b> gentiles: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20), <b>say</b> that his nakedness <b>is like</b> that of <b>a mere donkey</b> and does not constitute nakedness. Rav Yehuda <b>taught us that their</b> nakedness <b>is also considered nakedness, as it is written</b> regarding the sons of Noah: <b>“And their father’s nakedness they did not see”</b> (Genesis 9:23). Although Noah predated Abraham and was consequently not Jewish, his nakedness is mentioned. |
| Ezekiel 23:20 | called donkeys? As it is written: “Whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys” | Berakhot 58a:15 | <b>As he was leaving, that man said to</b> Rabbi Sheila: <b>Does God perform such miracles for liars?

Rabbi Sheila <b>saw that he was going to tell</b> the Persian authorities <b>that he called them donkeys.

| Ezekiel 24:3 | “Set on the pot, set it on” | Berakhot 56b:9 | Since rivers, birds, and pots have ambiguous connotations, it is recommended that someone who sees them in a dream recite a verse that interprets the dream positively. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, <b>one who sees a river in a dream</b> should <b>rise early</b> and <b>recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For distress will come in like a river”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>One who sees a bird in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a bird that wanders from her nest,</b> so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). <b>One who sees a pot in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us,” before a different verse,</b> which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Set on the pot, set it on”</b> (Ezekiel 24:3). |
| Ezekiel 24:17 | bind your splendor upon yourself” | Berakhot 11a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the exemption is <b>due to preoccupation,</b> then <b>even one</b> who is preoccupied because <b>his ship sank at sea</b> should <b>also</b> be exempt. The Gemara reinforces its question: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>in this case as well,</b> when one’s ship sank at sea, one is exempt, <b>why</b> then <b>did Rabbi Abba bar Zavda say</b> that <b>Rav said: A mourner is obligated in all the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah except for</b> the mitzva to don <b>phylacteries,</b> from which a mourner is exempt, <b>as</b> the term <b>splendor is stated</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Make no mourning for the dead, <b>bind your splendor upon yourself”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). It is inappropriate for a mourner to wrap himself in phylacteries, with regard to which, the term splendor was employed (<i>Tosafot</i>). If a mourner, who is clearly pained and preoccupied, is obligated to recite <i>Shema</i>, then certainly all others who are preoccupied, even one whose ship sank at sea, whose loss was merely monetary (<i>Birkat Hashem</i>), should be obligated. Why, then, is a groom exempted because of his preoccupation and one who lost his property is not? |
| Ezekiel 24:17 | “Bind your splendor upon yourself” | Berakhot 16b:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> a groom is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i> simply <b>due to preoccupation,</b> then <b>even</b> one who is preoccupied because <b>his ship sank at sea should</b> be exempt. If so, <b>why then did Rabbi Abba bar Zavda say</b> that <b>Rav said: A mourner is obligated in all the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah except for</b> the mitzva to don <b>phylacteries, as</b> the term <b>splendor is stated</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>as it is stated</b> that the prophet Ezekiel was prohibited to mourn and was told: <b>“Bind your splendor upon yourself”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). If even a mourner, who is pained and preoccupied, is obligated to recite <i>Shema</i>, clearly preoccupation has no bearing upon one’s obligation. |
| Ezekiel 31:8 | ” | Berakhot 53b:8 | <b>Come and hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rav Ḥisda bar Avdimi said:</b> The correct version is <i>omemot</i> beginning with an <i>ayin</i>, as it is stated: <b>“The cedars in the garden of God could not dim it</b> [<b><i>amamuhu</i></b>]<b>”</b> (Ezekiel 31:8). |
| Ezekiel 36:26 | and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh” | Berakhot 32a:3 | <b>One</b> is the verse just mentioned in which <b>it is written: “Those whom I have dealt in wickedness.” And one</b> is the verse in which <b>it is written: “Behold, like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel”</b> (Jeremiah 18:6). <b>And one</b> is the verse in which <b>it is written:</b> “And I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will place within you, <b>and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh”</b> (Ezekiel 36:26). These three verses indicate that God influences a person’s decisions, and therefore one does not have sole responsibility for his actions. |
| Ezekiel 36:27 | from here: “And I will place My spirit within you and I will cause you to walk in My statutes, | Berakhot 32a:4 | <b>Rav Pappa said</b> there is a clearer proof <b>from here: “And I will place My spirit within you and I will cause you to walk in My statutes,</b> and you will observe My decrees and do them” (Ezekiel 36:27). |
| Ezekiel 36:29 | Plenty, as it is written: “And I will call for the grain, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you” | Berakhot 55a:10 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three matters are proclaimed by the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself: Famine, plenty, and a good leader.</b> The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>Famine, as it is written: “For the Lord has called for a famine;</b> and it shall also come upon the land seven years” (II Kings 8:1). <b>Plenty, as it is written: “And I will call for the grain, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you”</b> (Ezekiel 36:29). And <b>a good leader, as it is written: “And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: See, I have called by name Bezalel,</b> son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah” (Exodus 31:1–2). |
| Ezekiel 38:3 | And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal” | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Ezekiel 41:22 | as it is written: “The altar, three cubits high | Berakhot 55a:3 | As for the virtue of <b>prolonging one’s</b> mealtime at the <b>table,</b> which Rav Yehuda mentioned, the Gemara explains: <b>Perhaps a poor person will come</b> during the meal and the host will be in a position to <b>give him</b> food immediately, without forcing the poor person to wait. The Sages elsewhere praised a person who acts appropriately at a meal, <b>as it is written: “The altar, three cubits high</b> and the length thereof, two cubits, was of wood, and so the corners thereof; the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were also of wood” (Ezekiel 41:22), <b>and it is written</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“And he said unto me: This is the table that is before the Lord.”</b> The language of this verse is difficult, as it <b>begins with the altar and concludes with the table.</b> Rather, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: As long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel’s</b> transgressions. <b>Now</b> that it is destroyed, <b>a person’s table atones for his</b> transgressions. |
| Ezekiel 46:9 | Rav Huna said: One who enters a synagogue to pray is permitted to make it a shortcut, as it is stated: “But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the appointed seasons, | Berakhot 62b:19 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: If it was originally a path</b> that passed through the site where the synagogue was erected, <b>one is permitted</b> to pass through, as the public right of passage is not negated by the construction of a synagogue. <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who enters a synagogue to pray is permitted to make it a shortcut, as it is stated: “But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the appointed seasons,</b> he that enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate” (Ezekiel 46:9). |
| Daniel 2:21 | possesses wisdom, as it is stated: “He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to they who know understanding” | Berakhot 55a:14 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, only grants wisdom to one who</b> already <b>possesses wisdom, as it is stated: “He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to they who know understanding”</b> (Daniel 2:21). <b>Rav Taḥalifa, from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>heard</b> this <b>and repeated it before Rabbi Abbahu.</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: You learned</b> proof for this idea <b>from there; we learn it from here: As it is written</b> in praise of the builders of the Tabernacle: <b>“And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed wisdom”</b> (Exodus 31:6). |
| Daniel 2:29 | as it is stated: “As for you, O king, your thoughts came upon your bed, | Berakhot 55b:21 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: A person is shown</b> in his dream <b>only the thoughts of his heart</b> when he was awake, as evidenced by what Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar, <b>as it is stated: “As for you, O king, your thoughts came upon your bed,</b> what should come to pass hereafter” (Daniel 2:29). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here,</b> a related verse: <b>“And that you may know the thoughts of your</b> heart” (Daniel 2:30).

| Daniel 6:11 | there were open windows | Berakhot 31a:19 | Many <i>halakhot</i> are derived from evoking the prayers of biblical characters. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One should always pray in a house with windows, as it is stated</b> regarding Daniel: “And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went to his house. In his attic <b>there were open windows</b> facing Jerusalem, and three times a day he knelt upon his knees and prayed and gave thanks before his God, just as he had done before” (Daniel 6:11). |
| Daniel 6:11 | there were open windows | Berakhot 34b:29 | <b>And</b> on the topic of prayer, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may only pray in a house with windows,</b> as then he can see the heavens and focus his heart, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Daniel’s prayer: “In his attic <b>there were open windows</b> facing Jerusalem” (Daniel 6:11). |
| Daniel 9:17 | Rav said: Even Daniel’s prayers were only answered on account of Abraham, as it is stated: “And now listen, God, to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication; and cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate Temple, for the sake of the Lord” | Berakhot 7b:2 | The Gemara cites another statement extolling that virtue of Abraham is mentioned, as <b>Rav said: Even Daniel’s prayers were only answered on account of Abraham, as it is stated: “And now listen, God, to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication; and cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate Temple, for the sake of the Lord”</b> (Daniel 9:17). The verse <b>should have said:</b> And cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate Temple, <b>for Your sake,</b> as Daniel was addressing the Lord. |
| Daniel 9:21 | regarding Gabriel, it is written: “The man, Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly, | Berakhot 4b:23 | After this discussion of the statement that Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Avina said, another statement of Rabbi Elazar is cited. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Avina said: What was said about</b> the angel <b>Michael is greater than what was said about</b> the angel <b>Gabriel. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), indicating that with a single flight, the seraph arrived and performed his mission, while <b>regarding Gabriel, it is written: “The man, Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly,</b> approached close to me about the time of the evening offering” (Daniel 9:21). The double language used in the phrase “to fly swiftly [<i>muaf biaf]</i>,” indicates that he did not arrive at his destination in a single flight, but rather, that it took him two flights. |
| Daniel 10:13 | and there, it is written: “And behold, Michael, one of the chief ministers of the king, came to my aid” | Berakhot 4b:25 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>one and one. Here, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), <b>and there, it is written: “And behold, Michael, one of the chief ministers of the king, came to my aid”</b> (Daniel 10:13). Since the verse from Daniel refers to Michael as “one,” which aggadic midrash interprets as “the unique one,” so, too, “one of the seraphs” described in Isaiah must also refer to the unique one, Michael. |
| Hosea 2:9 | and she will say ‘I will go and return to my first husband; for it was better for me then than now’” | Berakhot 7a:22 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: A single regret</b> or pang of guilt <b>in one’s heart is preferable to many lashes</b> administered by others that cause only physical pain, <b>as it is stated: “And she chases her lovers,</b> but she does not overtake them; she seeks them, but she will not find them; <b>and she will say ‘I will go and return to my first husband; for it was better for me then than now’”</b> (Hosea 2:9). Remorse is more effective than any externally imposed punishment listed in the verses that follow (Hosea 2:11–19). <b>And Reish Lakish said</b> that in the Bible, it seems that such remorse is <b>preferable to one hundred lashes, as it is stated: “A rebuke enters deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred lashes to a fool”</b> (Proverbs 17:10). |
| Hosea 2:10 | As it is stated: “And I gave them an abundance of silver and gold, which they used for the Ba’al” | Berakhot 32a:13 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “And Jeshurun grew fat and kicked”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:15). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> in the Torah is it derived that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, ultimately conceded to Moses</b> that the reason for the sin of the Golden Calf was indeed the riches lavished upon Israel? <b>As it is stated: “And I gave them an abundance of silver and gold, which they used for the Ba’al”</b> (Hosea 2:10). |
| Hosea 2:11 | Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction: It is written, “I will take back My grain at its time | Berakhot 35b:4 | On a similar note, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction: It is written, “I will take back My grain at its time</b> and wine in its season” (Hosea 2:11), <b>and it is written: “And you shall gather your grain,</b> your wine and your oil” (Deuteronomy 11:14). To whom does the grain belong: To God, or to the people? |
| Hosea 5:8 | “Blow you the horn [ shofar ] in Giva” | Berakhot 56b:11 | <b>One who sees a <i>shofar</i> in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great <i>shofar</i> shall be sounded;</b> and they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt” (Isaiah 27:13), <b>before a different verse,</b> in which the <i>shofar</i> is a symbol of war, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Blow you the horn [<i>shofar</i>] in Giva”</b> (Hosea 5:8). |
| Hosea 6:3 | eagerly strive to know the Lord” | Berakhot 6b:9 | <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who leaves the synagogue should not take large strides</b> because it creates the impression that he is eager to leave. <b>Abaye</b> explained Rav Huna’s statement and <b>said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>was only said</b> with regard <b>to leaving</b> the synagogue, where large strides seem particularly disrespectful. <b>However,</b> with regard <b>to entering</b> a synagogue, <b>it is a mitzva to run</b> and one is permitted to rush and take large strides (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto). <b>As it is said:</b> “And let us know, <b>eagerly strive to know the Lord”</b> (Hosea 6:3). One who eagerly enters a synagogue displays his enthusiasm to follow the path of God. |
| Hosea 6:4 | have no substance, as it is written: “For your goodness is as a morning cloud, | Berakhot 59a:11 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Morning clouds</b> dissipate immediately so they <b>have no substance, as it is written: “For your goodness is as a morning cloud,</b> and as the dew that early passes away” (Hosea 6:4). With regard to this, <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But</b> don’t <b>people say</b> the maxim: <b>If there is rain when people open their doors</b> in the morning, <b>donkey-driver, fold your sack and go to sleep,</b> as rain will continue to fall all day. Apparently morning clouds indicate that there will be rain all day. The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this,</b> that suggests that there will be considerable rain, refers to a case where the sky is <b>covered with thick clouds,</b> while <b>this</b> opinion, where Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said that morning clouds have no substance and will not produce much rain, refers to a case where the sky is <b>covered with flimsy clouds</b> which will certainly pass. |
| Hosea 9:10 | like grapes in the wilderness” | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite:</b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall,</b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Hosea 11:10 | One should always run for a matter of halakha , even on Shabbat, as it is stated: “They shall walk after the Lord, who will roar like a lion” | Berakhot 6b:10 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Initially, when I saw the Sages running to the</b> Rabbi’s <b>lecture on Shabbat, I said: These Sages are desecrating Shabbat.</b> One is prohibited from running on Shabbat in deference to the sanctity of the day. <b>Once I heard that which Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said: <b>One should always run for a matter of <i>halakha</i>, even on Shabbat, as it is stated: “They shall walk after the Lord, who will roar like a lion”</b> (Hosea 11:10). In other words, one should rush as though he were chased by a lion (<i>Birkat Hashem</i>), <b>I too run.</b> |
| Hosea 13:6 | Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me” | Berakhot 32a:12 | On a similar note, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: That is what people say</b> in a popular maxim: <b>Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me”</b> (Hosea 13:6). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This principle is derived not from the verse in Hosea, but <b>from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14). <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn</b> to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:20). |
| Hosea 14:7 | Rav said: The young men of Israel are destined to emit a sweet scent as the Lebanon, as it is stated: “His branches shall spread and his beauty will be as the olive tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon” | Berakhot 43b:4 | <b>And Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said: The young men of Israel are destined to emit a sweet scent as the Lebanon, as it is stated: “His branches shall spread and his beauty will be as the olive tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon”</b> (Hosea 14:7). |
| Amos 3:8 | rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear? | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Amos 4:12 | Rabbi Yonatan said: One who needs to relieve himself may not pray, because it is stated: “Prepare to greet your God, O Israel” | Berakhot 23a:5 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: One who needs to relieve himself may not pray, because it is stated: “Prepare to greet your God, O Israel”</b> (Amos 4:12), and one must clear his mind of all distractions to prepare to receive the Lord during prayer. |
| Amos 4:12 | One who drinks in pairs should not recite a blessing, because it is stated: “Prepare to meet your God, O Israel” | Berakhot 51b:8 | <b>Rav Asi said: One may not speak over a cup of blessing</b> from the moment he takes it in his hand until he drinks it. <b>And Rav Asi said: One may not recite a blessing over a cup of punishment.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is a cup of punishment? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: A second cup. That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who drinks in pairs should not recite a blessing, because it is stated: “Prepare to meet your God, O Israel”</b> (Amos 4:12). One must be well-prepared in order to stand before his Creator, <b>and this</b> person who drank two cups of wine <b>is not prepared,</b> as drinking an even number of cups of wine is dangerous due to demons. |
| Amos 4:13 | “Who forms mountains and creates [ boreh ] wind” | Berakhot 52b:29 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> How can there be a dispute over the meaning of the word <i>boreh</i>? In the following verses it is clear that it refers to acts of creation in the past: <b>“Who forms light and creates [<i>boreh</i>] darkness”</b> (Isaiah 45:7), <b>“Who forms mountains and creates [<i>boreh</i>] wind”</b> (Amos 4:13), or <b>“Who creates [<i>boreh</i>] the heavens and stretches them out”</b> (Isaiah 42:5). <b>Rather, said Rav Yosef: With regard to both <i>bara</i> and <i>boreh</i>, everyone agrees that</b> they <b>mean created. Where they disagree is with regard to the light</b> of the fire or <b>the lights</b> of the fire. <b>As Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>there is one light in a fire, and Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>there are many lights in a fire,</b> as a flame consists of red, green, and white light. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: There are many lights in the fire.</b> |
| Amos 5:2 | As it is written: “The virgin of Israel has fallen and she will rise no more; | Berakhot 4b:21 | Additionally, with regard to this psalm, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why is there no</b> verse beginning with the letter <b><i>nun</i> in <i>ashrei</i>? Because it contains</b> an allusion to <b>the downfall of the enemies of Israel,</b> a euphemism for Israel itself. <b>As it is written: “The virgin of Israel has fallen and she will rise no more;</b> abandoned in her land, none will raise her up” (Amos 5:2), which begins with the letter <i>nun</i>. Due to this verse, <i>ashrei</i> does not include a verse beginning with the letter <i>nun</i>. |
| Amos 5:8 | it is written: “He Who makes Pleiades and Orion” | Berakhot 58b:12 | On the subject of stars, the Gemara notes that <b>Shmuel raised a contradiction</b> between the implications of two verses with regard to constellations. On the one hand <b>it is written: “Who makes Ursa Major, Orion, and Pleiades,</b> and the chambers of the south” (Job 9:9); Orion precedes Pleiades. <b>And</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “He Who makes Pleiades and Orion”</b> (Amos 5:8); Pleiades precedes Orion. <b>So how</b> is this reconciled? The Gemara replies: <b>Were it not for Orion’s heat, the universe could not exist because of the cold of Pleiades;</b> and conversely, <b>were it not for the cold of Pleiades, the universe could not exist because of the heat of Orion.</b> |
| Amos 8:10 | and the end will be like a bitter day” | Berakhot 16b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to Rabban Gamliel’s bathing on the first night after the death of his wife, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> did not practice the customs of mourning after his wife died? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds that</b> acute mourning [<i>aninut</i>] is in effect only on the day of the death itself, but <b>acute mourning at night is</b> only <b>by rabbinic law, as it is written:</b> “And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations; I will bring sackcloth upon your loins and baldness upon every head; and I will make you like a mourner for an only child, <b>and the end will be like a bitter day”</b> (Amos 8:10). Therefore, by Torah law one’s acute mourning is only during the day, like a bitter day, while the acute mourning at night that follows is only rabbinic. <b>And in the case of a delicate person, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> that one should afflict himself during the period of acute mourning. |
| Amos 9:14 | “And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel | Berakhot 28a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: That is no proof. <b>Wasn’t it already stated</b> in another prophecy: <b>“And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel</b> and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them” (Amos 9:14), <b>and they have not yet returned?</b> In rendering the ruling, only proven facts may be taken into consideration. <b>They immediately permitted him to enter the congregation.</b> This proves that Rabban Gamliel did not absent himself from the study hall that day and participated in the halakhic discourse. |
| Micah 1:6 | its neighbors were blessed, as it is written: “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, a place for the planting of vineyards” | Berakhot 58a:1 | With regard to Babylonia, the Gemara cites what <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said:</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed.</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it, <b>as it is written: “I will also make it a possession for the bittern,</b> a wading bird, <b>and pools of water”</b> (Isaiah 14:23); not only will it be destroyed, but the site will become a habitat for destructive, environmentally harmful creatures. When <b>Samaria was cursed,</b> however, <b>its neighbors were blessed, as it is written: “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, a place for the planting of vineyards”</b> (Micah 1:6); although destroyed, it will serve a beneficial purpose. |
| Micah 3:3 | “Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Micah 4:6 | those with whom I have dealt in wickedness” | Berakhot 32a:1 | <b>As it is written</b> in a future prophecy: “In that day, says the Lord, I will assemble the lame, and I will gather those who are abandoned and <b>those with whom I have dealt in wickedness”</b> (Micah 4:6). God states that He caused Israel to act wickedly. |
| Micah 6:5 | And that is what the prophet said to Israel: “My nation, remember what Balak king of Moab advised, | Berakhot 7a:11 | <b>And that is what the prophet said to Israel: “My nation, remember what Balak king of Moab advised,</b> and how Balaam, son of Beor, responded; from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord” (Micah 6:5). <b>What is</b> meant by the statement: <b>“So that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord”?</b> |
| Nahum 1:9 | that a gale force wind does not last two hours, to fulfill that which is stated: “Trouble shall not rise up a second time” | Berakhot 59a:8 | We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna <b>that over wind</b> one recites the blessing: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>winds? Abaye said:</b> These are <b>gale force winds. Abaye said: We learned</b> through tradition <b>that there are no gale force winds at night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we see that there are</b> gale force winds at night? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> gale force wind that blows at night does not begin blowing at night; rather, it <b>begins</b> blowing <b>during the day. And Abaye said: We learned</b> through tradition <b>that a gale force wind does not last two hours, to fulfill that which is stated: “Trouble shall not rise up a second time”</b> (Nahum 1:9). The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we see that it does last</b> longer than two hours? The Gemara answers: Actually, it does not last longer than two hours. The fact that we sense that it does last longer is due to cases where it does not blow uninterruptedly, but <b>it</b> briefly <b>stops in between.</b> |
| Habakkuk 1:13 | that which is written: “Why do You look on those who deal treacherously and hold Your peace? When the wicked swallows the man more righteous than he?” | Berakhot 7b:21 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that this,</b> which says not to confront <b>and that,</b> which says to confront, are both referring <b>to a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling,</b> but the question of whether one is permitted to confront him depends on who is confronting him. <b>And</b> nevertheless, this is <b>not difficult. This,</b> which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring <b>to a completely righteous person, while this,</b> which says that one may not confront the wicked, is referring <b>to one who is not completely righteous, as Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Why do You look on those who deal treacherously and hold Your peace? When the wicked swallows the man more righteous than he?”</b> (Habakkuk 1:13). This verse is difficult to understand. <b>Do the wicked swallow the righteous? Isn’t it written:</b> “The wicked looks to the righteous and seeks to kill him; <b>the Lord will not leave him in his hand,</b> nor allow him to be condemned when he is judged” (Psalms 37:32–33), <b>and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21)? <b>Rather,</b> in light of these verses, the verse: “The wicked swallows the man more righteous than he” means: <b>The</b> man who is <b>more righteous than he,</b> but not completely righteous, <b>he swallows. The completely righteous he does not swallow.</b> |
| Zephaniah 3:9 | will convert, as it is stated: “For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, | Berakhot 57b:20 | We learned in the mishna that one who sees <b>a place from which idolatry was eradicated</b> should recite the blessing: Blessed…Who eradicated idolatry from our land. On this topic <b>the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who sees</b> the idol called <b>Mercury [<i>Markulis</i>] recites: Blessed…who has shown patience to those who violate His will,</b> as each day new rocks would be thrown upon the pile constructed in Mercury’ honor (<i>Tosafot</i>). One who sees <b>a place from which idolatry was eradicated should recite: Blessed…Who eradicated idolatry from our land. And just as it was eradicated from this place, so too may it be eradicated from all places of Israel, and restore the hearts of their worshippers to worship You. Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>one need not recite: And restore the hearts of their worshippers to worship You, since it is predominantly populated by gentiles. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one is required to recite that</b> formula <b>because</b> in the end of days all nations <b>will convert, as it is stated: “For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language,</b> that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to serve Him with one consent” (Zephaniah 3:9). |
| Zephaniah 3:18 | according to Rabbi Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are destroyed [ nugei ] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you, | Berakhot 28a:18 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who recites the additional prayer after seven hours</b> of the day, <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are destroyed [<i>nugei</i>] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you,</b> they who carried for you the burden of insult” (Zephaniah 3:18). <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that <i>nugei</i> is an expression of destruction? As Rav Yosef translated</b> the verse into Aramaic: <b>Destruction comes upon the enemies</b> of <b>the house of Israel,</b> a euphemism for Israel itself, <b>for they have delayed the times of the Festivals in Jerusalem.</b> This proves both that <i>nugei</i> means destruction and that destruction comes upon those who fail to fulfill a mitzva at its appointed time. |
| Zephaniah 3:18 | according to Rabbi Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are in sorrow [ nugei ] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you, | Berakhot 28a:19 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Regarding anyone who recites the morning prayer after four hours</b> of the day, <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are in sorrow [<i>nugei</i>] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you,</b> they who carried for you the burden of insult” (Zephaniah 3:18). <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that <i>nugei</i> is an expression of sorrow? As it is written: “My soul drips in sorrow [<i>tuga</i>]”</b> (Psalms 119:28). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The proof that <i>nugei</i> indicates suffering is <b>from here: “Her virgins are sorrowed [<i>nugot</i>] and she is embittered”</b> (Lamentations 1:4). |
| Zechariah 3:2 | “And the Lord said to the Satan: The Lord rebukes you, | Berakhot 51a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And if one encounters</b> women returning from a funeral, <b>what is his remedy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Let him jump four cubits from where he stands; if there is a river, let him cross it; if there is another path, let him go down it; if there is a wall, let him stand behind it; and if not, he should turn his face around and recite</b> the verse: <b>“And the Lord said to the Satan: The Lord rebukes you,</b> Satan, the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebukes you; is not this man a brand plucked from the fire?” (Zechariah 3:2), <b>until they pass him.</b> |
| Zechariah 9:9 | One who sees a donkey in a dream should anticipate salvation, as it is said: “Behold, your king comes unto you; he is triumphant, and victorious, lowly, and riding upon a donkey” | Berakhot 56b:18 | <b>One who sees a donkey in a dream should anticipate salvation, as it is said: “Behold, your king comes unto you; he is triumphant, and victorious, lowly, and riding upon a donkey”</b> (Zechariah 9:9). <b>One who sees a cat in a dream in a place where</b> in Aramaic <b>they call it <i>shunra</i>, a nice song [<i>shira na’a</i>] will be composed for him.</b> If he sees a cat in a place where they call cats <b><i>shinra</i>, it is a sign that he will undergo a change for the worse [<i>shinui ra</i>]. One who sees grapes in a dream</b> and they were <b>white</b> or light colored, regardless of <b>whether</b> it was <b>in their season or not in their season, it is a good</b> sign. One who sees <b>black</b> grapes <b>in their season, it is a good</b> omen. However, one who sees black grapes when it was <b>not in their season, it is a bad</b> omen. <b>One who sees a white horse in a dream,</b> regardless of <b>whether</b> the horse was <b>walking or running, it is a good</b> omen <b>for him.</b> One who sees a <b>red</b> horse <b>walking, it is a good</b> omen; <b>running, it is a bad</b> omen. |
| Zechariah 10:2 | say: “And the dreams speak falsely” | Berakhot 55b:14 | The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel, when he would see a bad dream,</b> would <b>say: “And the dreams speak falsely”</b> (Zechariah 10:2). <b>When he would see a good dream,</b> he would <b>say: And do dreams speak falsely? Isn’t it written: “I speak with him in a dream”</b> (Numbers 12:6)? |
| Malachi 2:5 | “And he was afraid before My name” | Berakhot 12a:26 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what we learned in praise of a priest: <b>“And he was afraid before My name”</b> (Malachi 2:5), indicating that one must be humbled and not upright before God’s name. |
| Malachi 3:16 | the Divine Presence is with them? As it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, | Berakhot 6a:11 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that two who sit and engage in Torah</b> study, <b>the Divine Presence is with them? As it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened,</b> and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name” (Malachi 3:16). The Divine Presence listens to any two God-fearing individuals who speak with each other. |
| Song of Songs 2:14 | as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring” | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet stated:</b> Even <b>a woman’s hair is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> for it too is praised, <b>as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats,</b> trailing down from Mount Gilead” (Song of Songs 4:1). |
